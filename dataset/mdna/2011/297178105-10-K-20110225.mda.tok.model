business strategies the following is a discussion of the company business strategies in regards to real estate investment and management 
business strategies research driven approach the company believes that successful real estate investment decisions and portfolio growth begin with extensive regional economic research and local market knowledge 
utilizing a proprietary research model that the company has developed over the last two decades  the company continually assesses markets where the company operates  as well as markets where the company considers future investment opportunities by evaluating the following focus on markets in major metropolitan areas that have regional population in excess of one million  constraints on new supply driven by i low availability of developable land sites where competing housing could be economically built  ii political growth barriers  such as protected land  urban growth boundaries  and potential lengthy and expensive development permit processes  and iii natural limitations to development  such as mountains or waterways  
table of contents rental demand is enhanced by affordability of rents relative to costs of for sale housing  and housing demand that is based on proximity to jobs  high median incomes  the quality of life and related commuting factors  as well as potential job growth 
recognizing that all real estate markets are cyclical  the company regularly evaluates the results of its regional economic  as well as its local market research  and adjusts the geographic focus of its portfolio accordingly 
the company seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets projected to have the strongest local economies and to decrease such allocations in markets projected to have declining economic conditions 
likewise  the company also seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets that have attractive property valuations and to decrease such allocations in markets that have inflated valuations and low relative yields 
property operations the company manages its communities by focusing on strategies that will generate above average rental growth  tenant retention satisfaction and long term asset appreciation 
the company intends to achieve this by utilizing the strategies set forth below property management the senior vice president of operations  divisional managers  regional portfolio managers and area managers are accountable for the performance and maintenance of the communities 
they supervise  provide training for the on site managers  review actual performance against budget  monitor market trends and prepare operating and capital budgets 
capital preservation the executive vice president of asset management and the capital and maintenance department are responsible for the planning  budgeting and completion of major capital improvement projects at the company communities 
business planning and control comprehensive business plans are implemented in conjunction with every investment decision 
these plans include benchmarks for future financial performance  based on collaborative discussions between on site managers and senior management 
development and redevelopment the company focuses on acquiring and developing apartment communities in supply constrained markets  and redeveloping its existing communities to improve the financial and physical aspects of the company communities

dispositions of real estate as part of its strategic plan to own quality real estate in supply constrained markets  the company continually evaluates all the communities and sells those which no longer meet its strategic criteria 
the company may use the capital generated from the dispositions to invest in higher return communities or other real estate investments  repurchase the company common stock  or repay debts 
the company believes that the sale of these communities will not have a material impact on its future results of operations or cash flows nor will their sale materially affect its ongoing operations 
generally  the company seeks to have any impact of earnings dilution resulting from these dispositions offset by the positive impact of its acquisitions  development and redevelopment activities

the estimated total cost of the predevelopment pipeline at december  was million 
the company may also acquire land for future development purposes or sale 
the company had incurred million in costs related to land held for future development or sale aggregating units as of december  redevelopment pipeline the company defines redevelopment communities as existing properties owned or recently acquired  which have been targeted for additional investment by the company with the expectation of increased financial returns through property improvement 
during redevelopment  apartment units may not be available for rent and  as a result  may have less than stabilized operations

offices and employees the company is headquartered in palo alto  california  and has regional offices in woodland hills  california  irvine  california  san diego  california and bellevue  washington

insurance the company carries comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the communities 
insured risks for comprehensive liabilities covers claims in excess of  per incident  and property casualty insurance covers losses in excess of a million deductible per incident 
there are  however  certain types of extraordinary losses  such as  for example  losses from terrorism and earthquakes  for which the company does not have insurance 
substantially all of the communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquakes 
the company believes it has a proactive approach to its potential earthquake losses 
the company utilizes third party seismic consultants for its acquisitions and may perform seismic upgrades to those acquisitions that are determined to have a higher level of potential loss from an earthquake 
the company utilizes third party loss models to help to determine its exposure 
the majority of the communities are lower density garden style apartments which may be less susceptible to material earthquake damage 
the company will continue to monitor third party earthquake insurance pricing and conditions and may consider obtaining third party coverage if it deems it cost effective 
although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities  employees  residents  and compliance with applicable laws  it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks  deductibles  co payments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material 
competition there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the company communities in attracting residents 
these include other apartment communities  and single family homes 
the communities also compete for residents with new and existing condominiums 
if the demand for the company communities is reduced or if competitors develop and or acquire competing housing on a more cost effective basis  rental rates and occupancy may drop which may have a material adverse affect on the company financial condition and results of operations 
the company faces competition from other real estate investment trusts  businesses and other entities in the acquisition  development and operation of apartment communities 
some competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the company 
this competition may result in increased costs of apartment communities the company acquires and or develops 

table of contents working capital the company believes that cash flows generated by its operations  existing cash and marketable securities balances  availability under existing lines of credit  access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of its reasonably anticipated cash needs during the timing  source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment  which can affect its plans for acquisitions  dispositions  development and redevelopment activities 
environmental considerations see the discussion under the caption  the company portfolio may have unknown environmental liabilities in item a  risk factors  for information concerning the potential effect of environmental regulations on its operations 
other matters certain policies of the company the company intends to continue to operate in a manner that will not subject it to regulation under the investment company act of the company has in the past five years and may in the future i issue securities senior to its common stock  ii fund acquisition activities with borrowings under its line of credit and iii offer shares of common stock and or units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership or affiliated partnerships as partial consideration for property acquisitions 
the company from time to time acquires partnership interests in partnerships and joint ventures  either directly or indirectly through subsidiaries of the company  when such entities underlying assets are real estate 
the company invests primarily in apartment communities that are located in predominantly coastal markets within southern california  the san francisco bay area  and the seattle metropolitan area 
the company currently intends to continue to invest in apartment communities in such regions 
however  these practices may be reviewed and modified periodically by management 
item a 
risk factors the company business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  those set forth below  any one of which could cause the company actual results to vary materially from recent results or from the company anticipated future results 
the company depends on its key personnel 
the company success depends on its ability to attract and retain executive officers  senior officers and company managers 
there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of any of the company key personnel could have an adverse effect on the company 
capital and credit market conditions may affect the company access to sources of capital and or the cost of capital  which could negatively affect the company business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
in recent years  the company financing activities have been impacted by the instability and tightening in the credit markets which has led to an increase in spreads and pricing of secured debt  unsecured debt  and lines of credit 
the company strong balance sheet  the debt capacity available on the unsecured line of credit with a bank group and the secured line of credit with freddie mac  and access to fannie mae and freddie mac secured debt financing have provided some insulation to the company from the turmoil experienced by many other real estate companies 
the company has benefited from borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac  and there are no assurances that these entities will lend to the company in the future 
continued turmoil in the capital markets and further job losses could negatively impact the company ability to make acquisitions  develop communities  obtain new financing  and refinance existing borrowing at competitive rates 

table of contents debt financing has inherent risks 
at december   the company had approximately billion of indebtedness including million of variable rate indebtedness  of which million is subject to interest rate protection agreements 
the company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing  including the following cash flow may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest  inability to refinance maturing indebtedness on encumbered apartment communities  inability to comply with debt covenants could cause an acceleration of the maturity date  and repaying debt before the scheduled maturity date could result in prepayment penalties 
the company may not be able to refinance such mortgage indebtedness or lines of credit 
the communities subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon or otherwise transferred to the lender 
this could cause the company to lose income and asset value 
the company may be required to refinance the debt at higher interest rates or on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 
debt financing of communities may result in insufficient cash flow to service debt 
where appropriate  the company intends to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on the company investments and to provide for additional investments that the company could not otherwise make 
there is a risk that the cash flow from the communities will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the internal revenue code 
the company may obtain additional debt financing in the future through mortgages on some or all of the communities 
these mortgages may be recourse  non recourse  or cross collateralized 
as of december   the company had of its consolidated communities encumbered by debt 
of the communities  are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those communities 
with respect to the remaining communities  there are cross collateralized mortgages secured by and communities  respectively 
the holders of this indebtedness will have rights with respect to these communities and lenders may seek foreclosure of communities which would reduce the company income and net asset value 
rising interest rates may affect the company costs of capital and financing activities and results of operation 
interest rates could increase rapidly  which could result in higher interest expense on the company variable rate indebtedness 
prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the company ability to make acquisitions and develop apartment communities with positive economic returns on investment and the company ability to refinance existing borrowings 
interest rate hedging arrangements may result in losses 
periodically  the company has entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with increases in interest rates  and may continue to do so 
although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates  they also may reduce the benefits to the company if interest rates decline 
if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged  the company may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other 
finally  nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject the company to increased credit risks 
in order to minimize counterparty credit risk  the company policy is to enter into hedging arrangements only with a rated financial institutions 
bond compliance requirements may limit income from certain communities 
at december   the company had approximately million of variable rate tax exempt financing relating to the following apartment communities inglenook court  wandering creek  boulevard  huntington breakers  camarillo oaks  fountain park  anchor village  hidden valley and belmont station 
this tax exempt financing subjects these communities to certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants 
the company expects to engage in tax exempt financings in the future 
the internal revenue code and rules and regulations thereunder impose various restrictions  conditions and requirements excluding interest on qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes 
the internal revenue code also requires that at least of apartment units be made available to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed a specified percentage  generally  of the median income for the applicable family size as determined by the housing and urban development department of the federal government 
in addition to federal requirements  certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions 
these restrictions may limit income from the tax exempt financed communities if the company is required to lower rental rates to attract residents who satisfy the median income test 
if the company does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for residents satisfying these income requirements  the tax exempt status of the bonds may be terminated  the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and the company may be subject to additional contractual liability 

table of contents general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values 
real estate investments are subject to a variety of risks 
the yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income generated and expenses incurred 
if the communities do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses  including debt service and capital expenditures  cash flow and the ability to make distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected 
income from the communities may be further adversely affected by  among other things  the following factors the general economic climate  local economic conditions in which the communities are located  such as oversupply of housing or a reduction in demand for rental housing  the attractiveness of the communities to tenants  competition from other available housing  and the company ability to provide for adequate maintenance and insurance 
as leases at the communities expire  tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to the company 
income and real estate values also may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws eg  the americans with disabilities act of and tax laws 
real estate investments are relatively illiquid and  therefore  the company ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite limited 
national and regional economic environments can negatively impact the company operating results 
during recent years  a confluence of factors has resulted in job losses  turmoil and volatility in the capital markets  and caused a national and global recession 
the company forecast for the national economy assumes the return of growth  with estimated gross domestic product growth of the national economy and the economies of the western states 
in the event of another recession  the company could incur continued reduction in rental rates  occupancy levels  property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising and turnover expenses 
inflation deflation may affect rental rates and operating expenses 
substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses 
acquisitions of communities may fail to meet expectations 
the company intends to continue to acquire apartment communities 
however  there are risks that acquisitions will fail to meet the company expectations 
the company estimates of future income  expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that is necessary to allow the company to market an acquired apartment community as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate 
the company expects to finance future acquisitions  in whole or in part  under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating partnership or related partnerships or additional equity by the company 
the use of equity financing  rather than debt  for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of the company existing stockholders 
if the company finances new acquisitions under existing lines of credit  there is a risk that  unless the company obtains substitute financing  the company may not be able to secure further lines of credit for new development or such lines of credit may be not available on advantageous terms 

table of contents development and redevelopment activities may be delayed  not completed  and or not achieve expected results 
the company pursues development and redevelopment projects and these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals  which have no assurance of being received 
the company development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks  including the following funds may be expended and management time devoted to projects that may not be completed  construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates possibly making the project economically unfeasible  projects may be delayed due to  without limitation  adverse weather conditions  occupancy rates and rents at a completed project may be less than anticipated  and expenses at completed development projects may be higher than anticipated 
these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the company stockholders 
further  the development and redevelopment of communities is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments 
for further information regarding these risks  please see the risk factor general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values 
the geographic concentration of the company communities and fluctuations in local markets may adversely impact the company financial condition and operating results 
the company generated significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december   from the company communities concentrated in southern california los angeles  orange  santa barbara  san diego  and ventura counties  northern california the san francisco bay area  and the seattle metropolitan area 
for the year ended december   of the company rental revenues were generated from communities located in california 
this geographic concentration could present risks if local property market performance falls below expectations 
the economic condition of these markets could affect occupancy  property revenues  and expenses  from the communities and their underlying asset values 
the financial results of major local employers also may impact the cash flow and value of certain of the communities 
this could have a negative impact on the company financial condition and operating results  which could affect the company ability to pay expected dividends to its stockholders 
competition in the apartment community market may adversely affect operations and the rental demand for the company communities 
there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the company communities in attracting residents 
these include other apartment communities and single family homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the communities are located 
if the demand for the company communities is reduced or if competitors develop and or acquire competing apartment communities on a more cost effective basis  rental rates may drop  which may have a material adverse affect on the company financial condition and results of operations 
the company also faces competition from other real estate investment trusts  businesses and other entities in the acquisition  development and operation of apartment communities 
this competition may result in an increase in costs and prices of apartment communities that the company acquires and or develops 
the price per share of the company stock may fluctuate significantly 
the market price per share of the company common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors  including  without limitation regional  national and global economic conditions  actual or anticipated variations in the company quarterly operating results or dividends  changes in the company funds from operations or earnings estimates  issuances of common stock  preferred stock or convertible debt securities  publication of research reports about the company or the real estate industry  the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities including securities issued by other real estate based companies  general stock and bond market conditions  including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities  that may lead prospective purchasers of the company stock to demand a higher annual yield from dividends  availability to credit markets and cost of credit  a change in analyst ratings or the company credit ratings  and terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which the company securities trade  possibly increasing market volatility and causing erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending 
natural disasters such as earthquakes 
table of contents many of the factors listed above are beyond the company control 
these factors may cause the market price of shares of the company common stock to decline  regardless of the company financial condition  results of operations  or business prospects 
the company future issuances of common stock  preferred stock or convertible debt securities could adversely affect the market price of the company common stock 
in order to finance the company acquisition and development activities  the company has issued and sold common stock  preferred stock and convertible debt securities 
for example  during and  the company issued and sold million and million shares of common stock for million and million  net of fees and commissions  respectively 
the company may in the future sell further shares of common stock  including pursuant to its equity distribution programs with cantor fitzgerald co  keybanc capital markets inc  barclays capital inc  bmo capital markets corp  liquidnet  inc  and mitsubishi ufj securities usa  inc 
in  the company filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec  allowing the company to sell an undetermined number of equity and debt securities as defined in the prospectus 
future sales of common stock  preferred stock or convertible debt securities may dilute stockholder ownership in the company and could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
the company chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments  which may lead to conflicts of interest 
the company chairman  george m

notwithstanding this agreement  mr 
marcus and his affiliated entities may potentially compete with the company in acquiring and or developing apartment communities  which competition may be detrimental to the company 
in addition  due to such potential competition for real estate investments  mr 
marcus and his affiliated entities may have a conflict of interest with the company  which may be detrimental to the interests of the company stockholders 
the influence of executive officers  directors and significant stockholders may be detrimental to holders of common stock 
as of december   george m 
marcus  the chairman of the company board of directors  wholly or partially owned million shares of common stock including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and certain other partnerships and assuming exercise of all vested options 
this represents approximately of the outstanding shares of the company common stock 
mr 
marcus currently does not have majority control over the company 
however  he currently has  and likely will continue to have  significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions

table of contents the voting rights of preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede actions that otherwise benefit holders of common stock 
essex currently has outstanding shares of series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock series f preferred stock 
also  under certain circumstances  the operating partnership series b preferred units as defined in the second amended and restated partnership agreement for the operating partnership are convertible into shares of series b preferred stock of essex 
in general  the holders of the company outstanding shares of preferred stock do not have any voting rights 
however  if full distributions are not made on any outstanding preferred stock for six quarterly distributions periods  the holders of preferred stock who have not received distributions  voting together as a single class  will have the right to elect two additional directors to serve on the company board of directors 
these voting rights continue until all distributions in arrears and distributions for the current quarterly period on the preferred stock have been paid in full 
at that time  the holders of the preferred stock are divested of these voting rights  and the term and office of the directors so elected immediately terminates 
while any shares of the company preferred stock are outstanding  the company may not  without the consent of the holders of two thirds of the outstanding shares of each series of preferred stock  each voting separately as a single class authorize or create any class or series of stock that ranks senior to such preferred stock with respect to the payment of dividends  rights upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the company business  amend  alter or repeal the provisions of the company charter or bylaws  including by merger or consolidation  that would materially and adversely affect the rights of such series of preferred stock  or in the case of the preferred stock into which the preferred units are exchangeable  merge or consolidate with another entity or transfer substantially all of its assets to another entity  except if such preferred stock remains outstanding with the surviving entity and has the same terms and in certain other circumstances 
these voting rights of the preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede or veto actions that would otherwise benefit the holders of the company common stock 
the redemption rights of the series b preferred units and series f preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of the company common stock 
upon the occurrence of one of the following events  the terms of the operating partnership series b preferred units require it to redeem all of such units and the terms of the company series f preferred stock provide the holders of the majority of the outstanding series f preferred stock the right to require the company to redeem all of such stock the company completes a going private transaction and its common stock is no longer registered under the securities exchange act of  as amended  the company completes a consolidation or merger or sale of substantially all of its assets and the surviving entity debt securities do not possess an investment grade rating  the company fails to qualify as a reit 
the aggregate redemption price of the series b preferred units would be million and the aggregate redemption price of the series f preferred stock would be million  plus  in each case  any accumulated distributions 
these redemption rights may discourage or impede transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of holders of common stock 
further  these redemption rights might trigger situations where the company needs to conserve its cash reserves  in which event such redemption might adversely affect the company and its common holders 
the maryland business combination law may not allow certain transactions between the company and its affiliates to proceed without compliance with such law 
under maryland law  business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
these business combinations include a merger  consolidation  share exchange  or  in circumstances specified in the statute  an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities 
an interested stockholder is defined as any person and certain affiliates of such person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting stock 
the law also requires a supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions 
this means that the transaction must be approved by at least of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares  and two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom the business combination is to be effected 

table of contents the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions  including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
these voting provisions do not apply if the stockholders receive a minimum price  as defined under maryland law 
as permitted by the statute  the board of directors of the company irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination by the company  george m 
marcus  who is the chairman of the company  and tmmc or any entity owned or controlled by mr 
marcus and tmmc 
consequently  the five year prohibition and supermajority vote requirement described above will not apply to any business combination between the company  mr 
marcus  or tmmc 
as a result  the company may in the future enter into business combinations with mr 
marcus and tmmc  without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the maryland general corporation law 
anti takeover provisions contained in the operating partnership agreement  charter  bylaws  and certain provisions of maryland law could delay  defer or prevent a change in control 
while the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership  and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the operating partnership  certain provisions of the operating partnership agreement place limitations on the company ability to act with respect to the operating partnership 
such limitations could delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the company stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect the interest of the company stockholders 
the partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership  the company cannot  without first obtaining the consent of a majority in interest of the limited partners in the operating partnership  transfer all or any portion of the company general partner interest in the operating partnership to another entity 
such limitations on the company ability to act may result in the company being precluded from taking action that the board of directors believes is in the best interests of the company stockholders 
as of december   the limited partners held or controlled approximately of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership  allowing such actions to be blocked by the limited partners 
the company charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences  rights and other terms of such preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock 
the company may establish one or more series of preferred stock that could delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control 
such a transaction might involve a premium price for the company stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders of common stock 
also  such a class of preferred stock could have dividend  voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interest of holders of common stock 
the company charter contains other provisions that may delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might be in the best interest of the company stockholders 
the charter contains ownership provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock  which may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control 
for example  subject to receiving an exemption from the board of directors  potential acquirers may not purchase more than in value of the stock other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 
this may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock 

table of contents the maryland general corporations law restricts the voting rights of shares deemed to be control shares 
under the maryland general corporations law  control shares are those which  when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer  entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges 
although the bylaws exempt the company from the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law  the board of directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the bylaws at any time in the future 
moreover  any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the future  but also to control shares previously acquired 
if the provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated  the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law could delay  defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the company stockholders 
the company charter and bylaws also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of the company board of directors  which in turn may delay  defer or prevent a transaction  including a change in control 
those provisions include the company directors have terms of office of three years and the board of directors is divided into three classes with staggered terms  as a result  less than a majority of directors are up for re election to the board in any one year  directors may be removed  without cause  only upon a two thirds vote of stockholders  and with cause  only upon a majority vote of stockholders  the company board can fix the number of directors and fill vacant directorships upon the vote of a majority of the directors  stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or propose business for consideration at a stockholders meeting  and for stockholders to call a special meeting  the meeting must be requested by not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting 
the company joint ventures and joint ownership of communities and partial interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit the company ability to control such communities and partial interests 
instead of purchasing apartment communities directly  the company has invested and may continue to invest in joint ventures 
joint venture partners often have shared control over the operation of the joint venture assets 
therefore  it is possible that a joint venture partner in an investment might become bankrupt  or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company business interests or goals  or be in a position to take action contrary to the company instructions or requests  or its policies or objectives 
consequently  a joint venture partners actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk 
although the company seeks to maintain sufficient influence over any joint venture to achieve its objectives  the company may be unable to take action without its joint venture partners approval  or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without its consent 
should a joint venture partner become bankrupt  the company could become liable for such partner share of joint venture liabilities 
from time to time  the company  through the operating partnership  invests in corporations  limited partnerships  limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring  developing  financing  or managing real property 
in certain circumstances  the operating partnership interest in a particular entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity 
therefore  the operating partnership ability to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited 
furthermore  the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or partners in the case of a limited partnership of such an entity in the event that its operations conflict with the operating partnership objectives 
the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity 
in the event that such an entity becomes insolvent  the operating partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the entity 
the company has  and in the future may  enter into transactions that could require the company to pay the tax liabilities of partners  which contribute assets into joint ventures or the operating partnership  in the event that certain taxable events  which are within the company control  occur 
although the company plans to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on sale pursuant to the like kind exchange rules under section of the internal revenue code  the company can provide no assurance that the company will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they can expect to have a material impact on its financial position 

table of contents there are risks that fund ii may operate in ways that may adversely impact the company interests 
the company is the general partner of fund ii  and with fund ii there are the following risks the company partners in fund ii might remove the company as the general partner of fund ii  the company partners in fund ii might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company business interests or goals  or the company partners in fund ii might fail to approve decisions regarding fund ii that are in the company best interest 
investments in mortgages and other real estate securities could affect the company ability to make distributions to stockholders 
the company may invest in securities related to real estate  which could adversely affect the company ability to make distributions to stockholders 
the company may purchase securities issued by entities which own real estate and invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations 
these mortgages may be first  second or third mortgages that may or may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed 
in general  investments in mortgages include the following risks that the value of mortgaged property may be less than the amounts owed  causing realized or unrealized losses  the borrower may not pay indebtedness under the mortgage when due  requiring the company to foreclose  and the amount recovered in connection with the foreclosure may be less than the amount owed  that interest rates payable on the mortgages may be lower than the company cost of funds  and in the case of junior mortgages  that foreclosure of a senior mortgage could eliminate the junior mortgage 
if any of the above were to occur  cash flows from operations and the company ability to make expected dividends to stockholders could be adversely affected 
compliance with laws benefiting disabled persons may require the company to make significant unanticipated expenditures or impact the company investment strategy 
a number of federal  state and local laws including the americans with disabilities act and regulations exist that may require modifications to existing buildings or restrict certain renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons and may require other structural features which add to the cost of buildings under construction 
legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on the company with respect to improved access by disabled persons 
the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may be substantial 
the company portfolio may have unknown environmental liabilities 
under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  an owner or operator of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on  in  to or migrating from such property 
such laws often impose liability without regard as to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly remediate such substances  may adversely affect the owner or operator ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral 
persons exposed to such substances  either through soil vapor or ingestion of the substances may claim personal injury damages 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility to which such substances or wastes were sent  whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person 
certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials acms into the air  and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of apartment communities for personal injury associated with acms 
in connection with the ownership direct or indirect  operation  management and development of apartment communities  the company could be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and  therefore  may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs  as well as certain other costs  including governmental fines and costs related to injuries of persons and property 

table of contents investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property 
the company carries certain limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk 
the company has conducted environmental studies which revealed the presence of groundwater contamination at certain communities 
such contamination at certain of these apartment communities was reported to have migrated on site from adjacent industrial manufacturing operations 
the former industrial users of the communities were identified as the source of contamination 
the environmental studies noted that certain communities are located adjacent to possible down gradient from sites with known groundwater contamination  the lateral limits of which may extend onto such apartment communities 
the environmental studies also noted that at certain of these apartment communities  contamination existed because of the presence of underground fuel storage tanks  which have been removed 
in general  in connection with the ownership  operation  financing  management and development of apartment communities the company may be potentially liable for removal or clean up costs  as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities 
the company may also be subject to governmental fines and costs related to injuries to persons and property 
there have been a number of lawsuits in recent years against owners and managers of apartment communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate 
some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements 
the company has been sued for mold related matters and has settled some  but not all  of such matters 
insurance carriers have reacted to mold related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates 
the company has  however  purchased pollution liability insurance  which includes some coverage for mold 
the company has adopted policies for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold when it is detected  and to minimize any impact mold might have on residents of the property 
the company believes its mold policies and proactive response to address any known existence  reduces its risk of loss from these cases 
there can be no assurances that the company has identified and responded to all mold occurrences 
liabilities resulting from such mold related matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as of december   potential liabilities for mold and other environmental liabilities are not considered probable or the loss cannot be quantified or estimated 
california has enacted legislation commonly referred to as proposition requiring that clear and reasonable warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity  including tobacco smoke 
although the company has sought to comply with proposition requirements  the company cannot assure you that the company will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to proposition methane gas is a naturally occurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in several areas  particularly in the southern california coastal areas 
methane is a non toxic gas  but can be ignitable in confined spaces 
although naturally occurring  methane gas is not regulated at the state or federal level  however some local governments  such as the county of los angeles  have imposed requirements that new buildings install detection systems in areas where methane gas is known to be located 
methane gas is also associated with certain industrial activities  such as former municipal waste landfills 
radon is also a naturally occurring gas that is found below the surface 
the company cannot assure you that it will not be adversely affected by costs related to its compliance with methane or radon gas related requirements or litigation costs related to methane or radon gas 
the company has almost no indemnification agreements from third parties for potential environmental clean up costs at its communities 
the company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown environmental conditions or violations with respect to communities formerly owned by the company 
no assurance can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of the communities reveal all environmental liabilities  that any prior owner or operator of an apartment community did not create any material environmental condition not known to the company  or that a material environmental condition does not exist as to any one or more of the communities 
the company has limited insurance coverage for the types of environmental liabilities described above 
the company may incur general uninsured losses 
the company carries comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the communities 
there are  however  certain types of extraordinary losses  such as  for example  losses for terrorism or earthquake  for which the company does not have insurance coverage 
substantially all of the communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity 
in january  the company canceled its then existing earthquake policy and established a wholly owned insurance subsidiary  pacific western insurance llc pwi 
through pwi  the company is self insured as it relates to earthquake related losses 
additionally  since january  pwi has provided property and casualty insurance coverage for the first million of the company property level insurance claims per incident 

table of contents although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities  employees  residents  and compliance with applicable laws  it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks  deductibles  co payments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material 
in the event of a substantial loss  insurance coverage may not be able to cover the full replacement cost of the company lost investment  or the insurance carrier may become insolvent and not be able to cover the full amount of the insured losses 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations and other factors might also affect the company ability to replace or renovate an apartment community after it has been damaged or destroyed 
changes in real estate tax and other laws may adversely affect the company results of operations 
generally the company does not directly pass through costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants 
the company also does not generally pass through increases in income  service or other taxes  to tenants under leases 
these costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 
similarly  compliance with changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on apartment communities or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing may result in significant unanticipated decrease in revenue or increase in expenditures  which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 
changes in the company financing policy may lead to higher levels of indebtedness 
the company has adopted a policy of maintaining a limit on debt financing consistent with the existing covenants required to maintain the company unsecured line of credit bank facility 
the company organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred 
if the company changed this policy  the company could incur more debt  resulting in an increased risk of default on the company obligations and the obligations of the operating partnership  and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect the company financial condition and results of operations 
such increased debt could exceed the underlying value of the communities 
the company is subject to various tax risks 
the company has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code 
the company qualification as a reit requires it to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations  and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company control 
although the company intends that its current organization and method of operation enables it to qualify as a reit  it cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future 
future legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions any of which could have retroactive effect could adversely affect the company ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect the company stockholders 
if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  the company would be subject to us federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on the company taxable income at corporate rates  and the company would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its shareholders in computing its taxable income 
the company may also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which the company failed to qualify 
the additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders  and the company would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders 
even if the company continues to qualify as a reit  it will continue to be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on the company income and property 
the company has established several taxable reit subsidiaries trss 
despite its qualification as a reit  the company trss must pay us federal income tax on their taxable income 
while the company will attempt to ensure that its dealings with its trss do not adversely affect its reit qualification  it cannot provide assurance that it will successfully achieve that result 
furthermore  it may be subject to a penalty tax  or its trss may be denied deductions  to the extent its dealings with its trss are not deemed to be arm length in nature 
no assurances can be given that the company dealings with its trss will be arm length in nature 

table of contents from time to time  the company may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of its properties 
under the internal revenue code  any gain resulting from transfers of properties that the company holds as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a penalty tax 
since the company acquires properties for investment purposes  it does not believe that its occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions 
however  whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction 
the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by the company are prohibited transactions 
if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction  then the company would be required to pay a penalty tax on any gain allocable to it from the prohibited transaction and the company ability to retain future gains on real property sales may be jeopardized 
income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect the company ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes 
therefore  no assurances can be given that the company will be able to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit 
the us federal tax rate on certain corporate dividends paid to individuals and other non corporate taxpayers is at a reduced rate of until december  
it is uncertain whether this reduced rate will be continued beyond the scheduled expiration date 
dividends paid by reits to individuals and other non corporate stockholders are not eligible for the reduced rate  however 
this may cause investors to view reit investments to be less attractive than investments in non reit corporations  which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock in reits  including the company stock 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties the company portfolio as of december  including communities owned by fund ii was comprised of apartment communities comprising  apartment units  of which  units are located in southern california   units are located in the san francisco bay area  and  units are located in the seattle metropolitan area 
the company apartment communities accounted for of the company revenues for the year ended december  occupancy rates the company average financial occupancies for the company stabilized apartment communities or same properties stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the years ended december  and remained consistent at for and financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue 
when calculating actual rents for occupied units and market rents for vacant units  delinquencies and concessions are not taken into account 
total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units  with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents 
the company believes that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate 
financial occupancy may not completely reflect short term trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the company calculation of financial occupancy 
market rates are determined using a variety of factors such as effective rental rates at the property based on recently signed leases and asking rates for comparable properties in the market 
the recently signed effective rates at the property are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant units 
the company then increases or decreases these rates based on the supply and demand in the apartment community market 
the company will check the reasonableness of these rents based on its position within the market and compare the rents against the asking rents by comparable properties in the market 

table of contents for apartment communities that are development properties in lease up without stabilized occupancy figures  the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric 
while an apartment community is in the lease up phase  the company primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives  and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual revenue is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy 
apartment communities the company apartment communities are primarily suburban garden style apartment communities and town homes comprising multiple clusters of two and three story buildings situated on three to fifteen acres of land 
as of december   the company apartment communities include garden style  mid rise  and high rise apartment communities 
the apartment communities have an average of approximately units  with a mix of studio  one  two and some three bedroom units 
a wide variety of amenities are available at the company communities  including covered parking  fireplaces  swimming pools  clubhouses with fitness facilities  volleyball and playground areas and tennis courts 
the company selects  trains and supervises on site service and maintenance personnel 
the company believes that the following primary factors enhance the company ability to retain tenants located near employment centers  attractive communities that are well maintained  and proactive customer service approach 
commercial buildings the company corporate headquarters is located in two office buildings with approximately  square feet located at east meadow drive  palo alto  california 
the company also owns an office building in woodland hills  california  comprised of approximately  square feet  of which the company occupies approximately  square feet at december  the company owns an office building with approximately  square feet located in irvine  california  of which the company occupies approximately  square feet at december  the company owns essex hollywood  a  square foot commercial building as a future development site that is currently leased as a production studio

results of operations comparison of year ended december  to the year ended december the company average financial occupancies for the company stabilized apartment communities or same properties stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the years ended december  and remained consistent at for and financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue 
when calculating actual rents for occupied units and market rents for vacant units  delinquencies and concessions are not taken into account 
total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units  with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents 
the company believes that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate 
financial occupancy may not completely reflect short term trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the company calculation of financial occupancy 
market rates are determined using a variety of factors such as effective rental rates at the property based on recently signed leases and asking rates for comparable properties in the market 
the recently signed effective rates at the property are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant units 
the company then increases or decreases these rates based on the supply and demand in the apartment community market 
the company will check the reasonableness of these rents based on its position within the market and compare the rents against the asking rents by comparable properties in the market 

table of contents for apartment communities that are development properties in lease up without stabilized occupancy figures  the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric 
while an apartment community is in the lease up phase  the company primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives  and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual revenue is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company defines critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require the company management to exercise their most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
the company critical accounting policies relate principally to the following key areas i consolidation under applicable accounting standards of various entities  ii assessing the carrying values of the company real estate and investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates  and iii internal cost capitalization 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  current market conditions  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 
the company assesses each entity in which it has an investment or contractual relationship to determine if it may be deemed to be a vie 
if such an entity is a vie  then the company performs an analysis to determine who is the primary beneficiary 
if the company is the primary beneficiary  then the entity is consolidated 
the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and judgmental  and the analysis must be applied to various types of entities and legal structures 
the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures  and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under development 
local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable  the carrying amount is evaluated 
if the sum of the property expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property  then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges 
when the company determines that a property is held for sale  it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property 
the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status 
assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell 
with respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates  the company looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties 
further  the company evaluates whether its co investments have other than temporary impairment and  if so  records an additional write down 
the company capitalizes all direct and certain indirect costs  including interest and real estate taxes  incurred during development and redevelopment activities 
interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use 
the amount of interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting period 
included in capitalized costs are management accounting estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with the company development and redevelopment activities 
indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and development accounting  legal fees  and various office costs that clearly relate to projects under development

table of contents funds from operations ffo ffo is a financial measure that is commonly used in the reit industry 
the company presents funds from operations as a supplemental operating performance measure 
ffo is not used by the company  nor should it be considered to be  as an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of the company operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of the company ability to fund its cash needs 
ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present  nor does the company intend it to present  a complete picture of its financial condition and operating performance 
the company believes that net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings 
further  the company believes that its consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with gaap  provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance 
in calculating ffo  the company follows the definition for this measure published by the national association of reits nareit  which is a reit trade association 
the company believes that  under the nareit ffo definition  the two most significant adjustments made to net income are i the exclusion of historical cost depreciation and ii the exclusion of gains and losses from the sale of previously depreciated properties 
essex agrees that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons a historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes  through depreciation charges  that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
nareit stated in its white paper on funds from operations since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
consequently  nareit definition of ffo reflects the fact that real estate  as an asset class  generally appreciates over time and depreciation charges required by gaap do not reflect the underlying economic realities 
b reits were created as a legal form of organization in order to encourage public ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the business of long term ownership and management of real estate 
the exclusion  in nareit definition of ffo  of gains from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long term assets that form the core of a reit activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 
management has consistently applied the nareit definition of ffo to all periods presented 
however  other reits in calculating ffo may vary from the nareit definition for this measure  and thus their disclosure of ffo may not be comparable to the company calculation 

table of contents the following table sets forth the company calculation of ffo for and for the year ended for the quarter ended in thousands net income available to common stockholders adjustments depreciation and amortization noncontrolling interests and co investments funds from operations weighted average number of shares outstanding  diluted for the year ended for the quarter ended net income available to common stockholders adjustments depreciation and amortization gains not included in ffo  net of internal disposition cost noncontrolling interests and co investments funds from operations weighted average number of shares outstanding  diluted amount includes the following i minority interest related to operating partnership units  and ii add back of depreciation expense from unconsolidated co investments and less depreciation attributable to third party ownership of consolidated co investments

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate hedging activities the company objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
to accomplish this objective  the company uses interest rate forward starting swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy 
as of december   the company has entered into one forward starting swap contract to mitigate the risk of changes in the interest related cash outflows on forecasted issuance of long term debt 
the forward starting swap is a cash flow hedge of the variability of forecasted interest payments associated with expected financings in as of december   the company also had million of variable rate indebtedness  of which million is subject to interest rate cap protection 
all of the company derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges  and the company does not have any fair value hedges as of december  the following table summarizes the notional amount  carrying value  and estimated fair value of the company derivative instruments used to hedge interest rates as of december  the notional amount represents the aggregate amount of a particular security that is currently hedged at one time  but does not represent exposure to credit  interest rates or market risks 
the table also includes a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the impact on the company derivative instruments from an increase or decrease in year treasury bill interest rates by basis points  as of december  carrying and estimated carrying value notional maturity estimate fair in thousands amount date range value basis points basis points cash flow hedges interest rate forward starting swaps interest rate caps total cash flow hedges interest rate sensitive liabilities the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the company interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows 
management has estimated that the fair value of the company billion and billion of fixed rate debt at december  and  respectively  to be billion and billion 
management has estimated the fair value of the company million and million of variable rate debt at december  and  respectively  is million and million based on the terms of existing mortgage notes payable and variable rate demand notes compared to those available in the marketplace 
for the years ended december  thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate million covered by a forward starting swap with a fixed rate of  with a settlement date on or before october  million subject to interest rate caps 

table of contents the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  the company ultimate realized gain or loss  with respect to interest rate fluctuations and hedging strategies would depend on the exposures that arise during the period
