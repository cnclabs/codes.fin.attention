this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forward looking statements with respect to the financial condition  results of operations and business of community bank system  inc these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements are set herein under the caption forward looking statements on page critical accounting policies as a result of the complex and dynamic nature of the company s business  management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying the most appropriate accounting policies for its various areas of operations 
the policy decision process not only ensures compliance with the latest generally accepted accounting principles gaap  but also reflects management s discretion with regard to choosing the most suitable methodology for reporting the company s financial performance 
it is management s opinion that the accounting estimates covering certain aspects of the business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance  or the level of subjectivity in the selection process 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that the critical accounting estimates include allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses reflects management s best estimate of probable loan losses in the company s loan portfolio 
determination of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective 
it requires significant estimates including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans and the amount of estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans which is based on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
investment securities investment securities are classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on the company s ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management s intentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  as a separate component of shareholders equity and do not affect earnings until realized 
the fair values of investment securities are generally determined by reference to quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments  or a discounted cash flow model using market estimates of interest rates and volatility 
investment securities with significant declines in fair value are evaluated to determine whether they should be considered other than temporarily impaired 
an unrealized loss is generally deemed to be other than temporary and a credit loss is deemed to exist if the present value of the expected future cash flows is less than the amortized cost basis of the debt security 
the credit loss component of an other than temporary impairment write down is recorded in earnings  while the remaining portion of the impairment loss is recognized in other comprehensive income loss  provided the company does not intend to sell the underlying debt security and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the debt security prior to recovery 
retirement benefits the company provides defined benefit pension benefits and post retirement health and life insurance benefits to eligible employees 
the company also provides deferred compensation and supplemental executive retirement plans for selected current and former employees and officers 
expense under these plans is charged to current operations and consists of several components of net periodic benefit cost based on various actuarial assumptions regarding future experience under the plans  including  but not limited to  discount rate  rate of future compensation increases  mortality rates  future health care costs and expected return on plan assets 
provision for income taxes the company is subject to examinations from various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions 
management believes that the assumptions and judgments used to record tax related assets or liabilities have been appropriate 
should tax laws change or the taxing authorities determine that management s assumptions were inappropriate  an adjustment may be required which could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
intangible assets as a result of acquisitions  the company has acquired goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill represents the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets at the acquisition date 
goodwill is evaluated at least annually  or when business conditions suggest an impairment may have occurred and will be reduced to its carrying value through a charge to earnings if impairment exists 
core deposits and other identifiable intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives 
the determination of whether or not impairment exists is based upon discounted cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
it also requires them to select a discount rate that reflects the current return requirements of the market in relation to present risk free interest rates  required equity market premiums and company specific risk indicators  all of which are susceptible to change based on changes in economic conditions and other factors 
future events or changes in the estimates used to determine the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
a summary of the accounting policies used by management is disclosed in note a  summary of significant accounting policies  starting on page executive summary the company s business philosophy is to operate as a community bank with local decision making  principally in non metropolitan markets  providing a broad array of banking and financial services to retail  commercial  and municipal customers

noninterest income as a percent of operating income fte basis was in  down percentage points from the prior year  but up percentage points from the current year decrease was due to the increase in net interest income being larger than the increase in noninterest income 
the increase from to was primarily driven by the strong growth in recurring bank fees  and secondary mortgage banking revenues 
this ratio is considered an important measure for determining the progress the company is making on one of its primary long term strategies  which is the expansion of noninterest income in order to diversify its revenue sources and reduce reliance on net interest margins that may be more directly impacted by general interest rate and other market conditions 
the largest portion of the company s recurring noninterest income is the wide variety of fees earned from general banking services  which reached million in  up from the prior year

this ratio was negatively impacted in compared to by the non recurring charges and the additional million of fdic expense during the year 
the efficiency ratio  a performance measurement tool widely used by banks  is defined by the company as operating expenses excluding special charges acquisition expenses  goodwill impairment and intangible amortization divided by operating income fully tax equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income  excluding net securities and debt gains and losses 
lower ratios are often correlated to higher operating efficiency 
the efficiency ratio for was percentage points lower than the ratio for due to a decrease in operating expenses  as defined  combined with a increase in net interest income and a increase in noninterest income 
in the efficiency ratio declined percentage points due to a increase in operating expenses  as defined  having a greater impact than a increase in net interest income and a increase in noninterest income excluding net securities gains and debt extinguishments costs 
the significant increase in fdic premiums with no corresponding income generation was the primary reason for the decline in the efficiency ratio for in addition  the efficiency ratios for both periods were adversely affected by the growing proportion of financial services activities  which due to the differing nature of their business  tend to result in proportionally higher efficiency ratios

there were two notable items during which impacted the effective tax rate for the year 
upon settlement of open tax years with certain taxing authorities  the company recorded million of previously unrecognized tax benefits 
additionally  the company recorded a million non cash goodwill impairment charge related to its wealth management businesses  reducing pre tax net income 
capital shareholders equity ended at million  up million  or  from one year earlier 
this increase reflects net income of million  million from the issuance of shares through employee stock plans  and million from stock based compensation 
these increases were partially offset by common stock dividends declared of million and a million decrease in other comprehensive income 
the change in other comprehensive income was comprised of a million decrease in the market value adjustment mva  represents the after tax  unrealized change in value of available for sale securities in the company s investment portfolio and a million increase in the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as a cash flow hedge 
excluding accumulated other comprehensive income in both and  capital rose by million  or 
shares outstanding increased by thousand during the year as a result of issuances made through employee stock plans 
shareholders equity ended at million  up million  or  from one year earlier 
this increase reflects net income of million  million from the issuance of shares through employee stock plans  million from stock based compensation and a million increase in other comprehensive income 
these increases were partially offset by common stock dividends declared of million 
the change in other comprehensive income is comprised of a million benefit based on the funded status of the company s employee retirement plans  a million increase in the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as a cash flow hedge and a million decrease in the mva 
the benefit from the funded status of the company s employee retirement plans is primarily the result of terminating the company s post retirement medical program for current and future employees 
remaining plan participants will include only existing retirees  or those active and eligible employees who retired prior to december  this change was accounted for as a negative plan amendment and was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in the fourth quarter of excluding accumulated other comprehensive income in both and  capital rose by million  or 
shares outstanding increased by thousand during the year  added through employee stock plans 
the company s ratio of tier capital to assets or tier leverage ratio  the basic measure for which regulators have established a minimum for an institution to be considered well capitalized  increased basis points to end the year at 
this was primarily the result of a increase in tier capital primarily from net income generation and reduction of intangible asset levels  being much greater than the year over year increase in fourth quarter average net assets excludes investment market value adjustment  intangible assets net of related deferred tax liabilities and disallowed mortgage service rights due mostly to organic deposit growth 
the tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was at the end of versus one year earlier 
the increase was due to the increase in common shareholders equity and reduction of intangible assets having a proportionally greater impact on tangible equity than the growth in tangible assets 
the company manages organic and acquired growth in a manner that enables it to continue to build upon its strong capital base  and maintain the company s ability to take advantage of future strategic growth opportunities 
cash dividends declared on common stock in of million represented an increase of over the prior year 
this growth was mostly due to dividends per share of for increasing from in  a result of quarterly dividends per share being raised from to in the second quarter of the dividend payout ratio for this year was compared to in  and in the payout ratio declined significantly in because dividends paid increased while net income increased 
in  the dividends paid increased in part due to the public issuance of million common shares in october to support the citizens acquisition while net income declined 
liquidity liquidity risk is a measure of the company s ability to raise cash when needed at a reasonable cost and minimize any loss 
the bank maintains appropriate liquidity levels in both normal operating environments as well as stressed environments 
the company is capable of meeting all obligations to its customers at any time and  therefore  the active management of its liquidity position remains an important management role 
the bank has appointed the asset liability committee to manage liquidity risk using policy guidelines and limits on indicators of a potential liquidity risk 
the indicators are monitored using a scorecard with three risk level limits 
these risk indicators measure core liquidity and funding needs  capital at risk and change in available funding sources 
these risk indicators are monitored using such statistics as the core basic surplus ratio  unencumbered securities to average assets  free loan collateral to average assets  loans to deposits ratio  deposits to total funding ratios and borrowings to total funding 
given the uncertain nature of our customers demands as well as the company desire to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities  the company must have available adequate sources of on and off balance sheet funds that can be acquired in time of need 
accordingly  in addition to the liquidity provided by balance sheet cash flows  liquidity must be supplemented with additional sources such as credit lines from correspondent banks  the federal home loan bank and the federal reserve bank 
other funding alternatives may also be appropriate from time to time  including wholesale and retail repurchase agreements  large certificates of deposit and brokered cd relationships 
the bank s primary sources of liquidity are its liquid assets  as well as unencumbered securities that can be used to collateralize additional funding 
at december   the bank had million of cash and cash equivalents of which million are interest earning deposits held at the federal reserve 
the bank also had million in unused federal home loan bank borrowing capacity based on the company s year end collateral levels 
additionally  the company has million of unencumbered securities that could be pledged at the federal home loan bank or federal reserve to obtain additional funding 
there is million available in unsecured lines of credit with other correspondent banks 
the company s primary approach to measuring liquidity is known as the basic surplus deficit model 
it is used to calculate liquidity over two time periods first  the amount of cash that could be made available within days calculated as liquid assets less short term liabilities as a percentage of total assets  and second  a projection of subsequent cash availability over an additional days 
as of december   this ratio was and for the respective time periods  excluding the company capacity to borrow additional funds from the federal home loan bank and other sources  as compared to the company s internal policy that requires a minimum of 
in addition to the and day basic surplus deficit model  longer term liquidity over a minimum of five years is measured and a liquidity analysis projecting sources and uses of funds is prepared 
to measure longer term liquidity  a baseline projection of loan and deposit growth for five years is made to reflect how liquidity levels could change over time 
this five year measure reflects ample liquidity for loan and other asset growth over the next five years 
the bank manages liquidity risk by preparing a sources and uses statement over the next year 
the report will show management if there is a potential for a liquidity shortfall within the next year 
in addition  stress tests on the cash flows are performed in various scenarios ranging from high probability events with low impact to low probability events with high impact 
the results of the stress tests as of december  indicate the bank has sufficient sources of funds for though remote  the possibility of a funding crisis exists at all financial institutions 
accordingly  management has addressed this issue by formulating a liquidity contingency plan  which has been reviewed and approved by both the board of directors and the company s asset liability management committee 
the plan addresses the actions that the company would take in response to both a short term and long term funding crisis 
a short term funding crisis would most likely result from a shock to the financial system  either internal or external  which disrupts orderly short term funding operations 
such a crisis should be temporary in nature and would not involve a change in credit ratings 
a long term funding crisis would most likely be the result of drastic credit deterioration at the company 
management believes that both potential circumstances have been fully addressed through detailed action plans and the establishment of trigger points for monitoring such events 
intangible assets the changes in intangible assets by reporting segment for the year ended december  are summarized as follows table intangible assets balance at additions balance at s omitted december  reclass amortization impairment december  banking segment goodwill other intangibles core deposit intangibles total other segment goodwill other intangibles total total banking and other segment intangible assets at the end of totaled million  a decrease of million from the prior year end due to million of amortization during the year 
intangible assets consist of goodwill  the value of core deposits and customer relationships that arise from acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill at december  totaled million  comprised of million related to banking acquisitions and million arising from the acquisition of financial services businesses 
goodwill is subjected to periodic impairment analysis to determine whether the carrying value of the acquired net assets exceeds their fair value  which would necessitate a write down of the goodwill 
the company completed its goodwill impairment analyses during the first quarters of and and no adjustments were necessary on the subsidiary bank or bpas 
the impairment analysis was based upon discounted cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
it also requires the selection of a discount rate that reflects the current return requirements of the market in relation to present risk free interest rates  required equity market premiums and company specific performance and risk indicators 
management believes that there is a low probability of future impairment with regard to the goodwill associated with whole bank  branch and bpas acquisitions 
the performance of nottingham previously elias asset management weakened subsequent to its acquisition in as a result of changes in market and competitive conditions 
its operating performance stabilized in and improved in and early  however  the significant declines in the average equity market valuations experienced in and into  changes in its mix of assets under management and market driven pricing compression resulted in meaningful revenue declines 
in connection with its on going forecasting and planning processes  management determined that triggering events had occurred in both the fourth quarter of and again in the fourth quarter of  and therefore the nottingham goodwill was tested for impairment in both periods 
based on the goodwill impairment analyses performed in the fourth quarters of both and the company recognized impairment charges and wrote down the carrying value of the goodwill by million in and million in the company completed its goodwill impairment analyses during the first quarter of and no adjustment was necessary 
no further triggering event occurred in additional declines in nottingham s projected operating results may cause future impairment to its remaining million goodwill balance 
core deposit intangibles represent the value of non time deposits acquired in excess of funding that could have been purchased in the capital markets 
core deposit intangibles are amortized on either an accelerated or straight line basis over periods ranging from seven to twenty years 
the recognition of customer relationship intangibles arose due to the acquisitions of abg  hb t and harbridge 
these assets were determined based on a methodology that calculates the present value of the projected future net income derived from the acquired customer base 
these assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis over periods ranging from ten to twelve years 
loans the company s loans outstanding  by type  as of december are as follows table loans outstanding s omitted consumer mortgage business lending consumer installment home equity gross loans allowance for loan losses loans  net of allowance for loan losses as disclosed in table above  gross loans outstanding of billion as of year end declined million or compared to december  the low interest rate environment led to strong consumer mortgage activity during the consumer mortgage portfolio increased million  despite the company s decision to not portfolio lower rate  longer term assets  but instead sell such originations in in the secondary market 
residential mortgage loans sold to investors  primarily fannie mae  totaled million in  as compared to million during the business lending portfolio declined million or as compared to year end the consumer installment portfolio was down million or  reflective of the lower demand in the automotive industry 
the home equity portfolio decreased million or due primarily to pay downs associated with the high level of mortgage refinancing being conducted in the low interest rate environment as well as the heightened deleveraging activities being undertaken by consumers in the current economic environment 
the compounded annual growth rate cagr for the company s total loan portfolio between and was comprised of approximately organic growth  with the remainder coming from acquisitions 
the greatest overall expansion occurred in the home equity and consumer mortgage segments  which grew at a and cagr including the impact of acquisitions  respectively  over that time frame 
the growth was primarily driven by robust mortgage refinancing volumes over the last five years  as well as the acquisition of consumer oriented banks and branches in that time period 
the consumer installment segment grew at a compounded annual growth rate of from to consumer installment loans consist of personal loans as well as borrowings originated in automobile  marine and recreational vehicle dealerships 
the business lending segment grew at a compounded annual growth rate of from to including acquisitions 
the weighting of the components of the company s loan portfolio enables it to be highly diversified 
approximately of loans outstanding at the end of were made to consumers borrowing on an installment  line of credit or residential mortgage loan basis 
the business lending portfolio is also broadly diversified by industry type as demonstrated by the following distributions at year end commercial real estate  healthcare  general services  agriculture  restaurant lodging  retail trade  manufacturing  construction  motor vehicle and parts dealers  and wholesale trade 
a variety of other industries with less than a share of the total portfolio comprise the remaining 
the consumer mortgage portion of the company s loan portfolio is comprised of fixed and adjustable rate residential lending and includes no exposure to subprime  alt a  or other higher risk mortgage products 
consumer mortgages increased million or in during the year ended december   the company originated and sold million of longer term fixed rate residential mortgages  principally to fannie mae 
consumer mortgage volume has been strong over the last few years due to historically low long term interest rates and comparatively stable valuations in the company s primary markets 
the company s solid performance during a tumultuous period in the overall industry is a reflection of the high quality profile of its portfolio and its ability to successfully meet customer needs at a time when some national mortgage lenders are restricting their lending activities in many of the company s markets 
interest rates and expected duration continue to be the most significant factors in determining whether the company chooses to retain versus sell and service portions of its new mortgage production 
the combined total of general purpose business lending  including agricultural related and dealer floor plans  as well as mortgages on commercial property is characterized as the company s business lending activity 
the business lending portfolio decreased million or in customer demand in this segment has remained soft due to economic conditions 
the company maintains its commitment to generating growth in its business portfolio in a manner that adheres to its twin goals of maintaining strong asset quality and producing profitable margins 
the company has continued to invest in additional personnel  technology and business development resources to further strengthen its capabilities in this key business segment 
consumer installment loans  both those originated directly such as personal installment loans and lines of credit  and indirectly originated predominantly in automobile  marine and recreational vehicle dealerships  declined million or from one year ago 
the origination and utilization of consumer installment loans has also encountered an extended period of soft demand due to lower consumer spending and deleveraging activities in response to weaker economic conditions 
sales of both new and used vehicles remained somewhat depressed in and and this adversely impacted the company s ability to generate the same level of new loan volume it has in previous years 
the company is focused on maintaining the solid profitability produced by its in market and contiguous market indirect portfolio  while continuing to pursue its disciplined  long term approach to expanding its dealer network 
a by product of the still historically low new vehicle sales rates has been an improvement in used car valuations  where the majority of the company s installment lending is concentrated 
it is expected that improved economic conditions in the future will enable the company to produce indirect loan growth more in line with longer term historical experience 
home equity loans declined million or from one year ago  as a result of home equity loans being paid off or down as part of the high level of mortgage refinancing activity that occurred in in the low rate environment 
in addition  home equity utilization has been adversely impacted by the heightened level of consumer deleveraging that is occurring in response to the continued weak economic conditions

as shown in table above  nonperforming loans  defined as nonaccruing loans  accruing loans days or more past due and restructured loans ended at million  down approximately million from one year earlier 
the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans remained consistent with the prior year at 
the ratio of nonperforming assets which includes other real estate owned  or oreo  in addition to nonperforming loans to total loans plus oreo increased to at year end  up two basis points from one year earlier 
the company s success at keeping these ratios at favorable levels despite weak economic conditions was the result of continued focus on maintaining strict underwriting standards  and enhanced collection and recovery efforts 
at year end  the company was managing oreo properties with a value of million  as compared to oreo properties with a value of million a year earlier 
no single property has a carrying value in excess of  despite the increase in oreo balances  the current level still reflects the low level of foreclosure activity in the company s markets and its specific portfolio in comparison to national markets 
approximately of the nonperforming loans at december  are related to the business lending portfolio  which is comprised of business loans broadly diversified by industry type 
with the economic downturn  certain businesses financial performance and position have deteriorated  and consequently the level of nonperforming loans remains higher than historical levels 
approximately of nonperforming loans at december  are related to the consumer mortgage portfolio 
collateral values of residential properties within the company s market area are not experiencing the significant declines in values that other parts of the country have encountered 
however  the continued soft economic conditions and high unemployment levels have adversely impacted consumers and businesses alike and have resulted in higher nonperforming levels 
the remaining eight percent of nonperforming loans relate to consumer installment and home equity loans 
the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans ratio  a general measure of coverage adequacy  was at the end of compared to at year end and at december   reflective of the higher level of nonperforming loans 
members of senior management  special asset officers  and lenders review all delinquent and nonaccrual loans and oreo regularly  in order to identify deteriorating situations  monitor known problem credits and discuss any needed changes to collection efforts  if warranted 
based on the group s consensus  a relationship may be assigned a special assets officer or other senior lending officer to review the loan  meet with the borrowers  assess the collateral and recommend an action plan 
this plan could include foreclosure  restructuring the loans  issuing demand letters  or other actions 
the company s larger criticized credits are also reviewed on at least a quarterly basis by senior credit administration  special assets and commercial lending management to monitor their status and discuss relationship management plans 
commercial lending management reviews the entire criticized loan portfolio on a monthly basis 
total delinquencies  defined as loans days or more past due or in nonaccrual status  finished the current year at of total loans outstanding  versus at the end of as of year end  total delinquency ratios for commercial loans  consumer installment loans  real estate mortgages and home equity loans were   and  respectively 
these measures were   and  respectively  as of december  delinquency levels  particularly in the to days category  tend to be somewhat volatile due to their measurement at a point in time  and therefore management believes that it is useful to evaluate this ratio over a longer period 
the average quarter end delinquency ratio for total loans in was  as compared to an average of in and in  reflective of the underlying economic conditions during those time periods 
the changes in the allowance for loan losses for the last five years is as follows table allowance for loan losses activity years ended december  s omitted except for ratios allowance for loan losses at beginning of period charge offs consumer mortgage business lending consumer installment home equity total charge offs recoveries consumer mortgage business lending consumer installment home equity total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses allowance on acquired loans allowance for loan losses at end of period amount of loans outstanding at end of period daily average of total loans net charge offs average loans outstanding this addition is attributable to loans acquired from citizens in  tlnb in  elmira and onb in as displayed in table above  total net charge offs in were million  down million from the prior year due to lower charge offs in the consumer installment portfolios  partially offset by somewhat higher levels of charge offs in the business lending  consumer mortgage and home equity portfolios 
net charge offs in were million higher than s level  due to higher levels of net charge offs in all portfolios  except home equity 
due to the significant increases in average loan balances over time due to acquisition and organic growth  management believes that net charge offs as a percent of average loans net charge off ratio offers a more meaningful representation of asset quality trends 
the net charge off ratio for was down three basis points from and was one basis point higher than gross charge offs as a percentage of average loans was in as compared to in and in continued strong recovery efforts were evidenced by recoveries of million in  representing of average gross charge offs for the latest two years  compared to in and in business loan net charge offs increased in  totaling million or of average business loans outstanding versus million or in  reflective of the general deterioration in economic conditions 
consumer installment loan net charge offs decreased to million this year from million in  with a net charge off ratio of in and in higher used automobile valuations benefited consumer installment recovery efforts  which increased to of current year gross charge offs  compared to in consumer mortgage net charge offs increased slightly in  and the net charge off ratio increased one basis point to 
home equity net charges offs were million in as compared to a small recovery in management continually evaluates the credit quality of the company s loan portfolio and conducts a formal review of the allowance for loan losses adequacy on a quarterly basis 
the two primary components of the loan review process that are used to determine proper allowance levels are specific and general loan loss allocations 
measurement of specific loan loss allocations is typically based on expected future cash flows  collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to pay 
impaired loans greater than million are evaluated for specific loan loss allocations 
consumer mortgages  consumer installment and home equity loans are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively 
the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent days or more 
the second component of the allowance establishment process  general loan loss allocations  is composed of two calculations that are computed on the five main loan segments business lending  consumer direct  consumer indirect  consumer mortgage and home equity 
the first calculation determines an allowance level based on the latest nine years of historical net charge off data for each loan category commercial loans exclude balances with specific loan loss allocations 
the second calculation is qualitative and takes into consideration eight qualitative environmental factors levels and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans  levels of and trends in charge offs and recoveries  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards  and other changes in lending policies  procedure  and practices  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff  national and local economic trends and conditions  industry condition  and effects of changes in credit concentrations 
the allowance levels computed from the specific and general loan loss allocation methods are combined with unallocated allowances  if any  to derive the required allowance for loan losses to be reflected on the consolidated statement of condition 
as it has in prior periods  the company strives to refine and enhance its loss evaluation and estimation processes continually 
in  the company developed and utilized more granular historical loss factors on a portfolio specific basis  as well as enhanced its use of both company specific and macro economic qualitative factors 
these enhancements did not result in a significant change to the determined reserve levels 
the loan loss provision is calculated by subtracting the previous period allowance for loan losses  net of the interim period net charge offs  from the current required allowance level 
this provision is then recorded in the income statement for that period 
members of senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses quarterly 
management is committed to continually improving the credit assessment and risk management capabilities of the company and has dedicated the resources necessary to ensure advancement in this critical area of operations 
the allowance for loan losses increased to million at year end from million at the end of the million increase was primarily due to the higher levels of delinquent loans partially offset by the decline in total loan balances 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans increased five basis points to for year end as compared to for and for management believes the year end allowance for loan losses to be adequate in light of the probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
the loan loss provision of million in decreased by million as a result of management s assessment of the probable losses in the loan portfolio  as discussed above 
the loan loss provision as a percentage of average loans was in as compared to in and in the loan loss provision was of net charge offs this year versus in and in  reflective of the assessed risk in a declining portfolio 
the following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category as of the dates indicated  as well as the percentage of loans in each category to total loans 
this allocation is based on management s assessment  as of a given point in time  of the risk characteristics of each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to changes when the risk factors of each component part change 
the allocation is not indicative of either the specific amounts of the loan categories in which future charge offs may be taken  nor should it be taken as an indicator of future loss trends 
the allocation of the allowance to each category does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category 
table allowance for loan losses by loan type loan loan loan loan loan s omitted except for ratios allowance mix allowance mix allowance mix allowance mix allowance mix consumer mortgage business lending consumer installment home equity unallocated total as demonstrated in table above and discussed previously  business lending and consumer installment by its nature carries higher credit risk than residential real estate  and as a result these loans carry allowance for loan losses that cover a higher percentage of their total portfolio balances 
as in prior years  the unallocated allowance is maintained for inherent losses in the portfolio not reflected in the historical loss ratios  model imprecision  and for acquired loan portfolios in the process of being fully integrated at year end 
the unallocated allowance decreased from million in to million in to million in the declines in the unallocated portion of the allowance  as well as changes in year over year allowance allocations reflect management s continued refinement of its loss estimation techniques 
however  given the inherent imprecision in the many estimates used in the determination of the allocated portion of the allowance  management deliberately remained cautious and conservative in establishing the overall allowance for loan losses 
management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance for loan losses to be prudent and reasonable 
furthermore  the company s allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan category 
funding sources the company utilizes a variety of funding sources to support the earning asset base as well as to achieve targeted growth objectives 
overall funding is comprised of three primary sources that possess a variety of maturity  stability  and price characteristics deposits of individuals  partnerships and corporations ipc deposits  municipal deposits that are collateralized for amounts not covered by fdic insurance public funds and external borrowings 
the average daily amount of deposits and the average rate paid on each of the following deposit categories are summarized below for the years indicated table average deposits average average average average average average s omitted  except rates balance rate paid balance rate paid balance rate paid noninterest checking deposits interest checking deposits regular savings deposits money market deposits time deposits total deposits as displayed in table above  total average deposits for equaled billion  up million or from the prior year 
consistent with the company s focus on expanding core account relationships and reducing higher cost time deposits  average non time core deposit balances grew million or as compared to while time deposits balances were managed downward by million or 
this shift in mix also reflects the diminished rate differential between core and non core deposits in the low interest rate environment 
average deposits in were up million or from excluding the average deposits acquired from the citizens branch acquisition  average deposits increased million or in as compared to the company s funding composition continues to benefit from a high level of non public deposits  which reached an all time high in with an average balance of billion  an increase of million or over the comparable period 
non public  non time deposits are frequently considered to be a bank s most attractive source of funding because they are generally stable  do not need to be collateralized  have a relatively low cost  and provide a strong customer base for which a variety of loan  deposit and other financial service related products can be sold 
full year average deposits of local municipalities increased million or during municipal deposit balances tend to be more volatile than non public deposits because they are heavily impacted by the seasonality of tax collection and fiscal spending patterns  as well as the longer term financial position of the local government entities  which can change significantly from year to year 
however  the company has many strong  long standing relationships with municipal entities throughout its markets and the diversified core deposits utilized by these customers has provided an attractive and comparatively stable funding source over an extended time period 
the company is required to collateralize all local government deposits in excess of fdic coverage with marketable securities from its investment portfolio 
because of this stipulation  as well as the competitive bidding nature of this product  management considers municipal time deposit funding to be similar to external borrowings and thus prices these products on a consistent basis 
the mix of average deposits in changed in comparison to the weighting of non time interest checking  noninterest checking  savings and money market accounts increased from their levels  while time deposits weighting decreased 
this change in deposit mix reflects the company s focus on expanding core account relationships and reducing higher cost time deposits 
the average balance for time deposit accounts decreased from of the total deposits in to of total deposits this year 
average core deposit balances increased from of the total deposits in to of total deposits this year 
this shift in mix  combined with lower average interest rates in all interest bearing deposit product categories caused the cost of interest bearing deposits to decline to in  as compared to in and in the total cost of deposit funding including demand deposits also declined significantly in to versus in  benefiting from the increase in non interest bearing checking accounts 
the remaining maturities of time deposits in amounts of  or more outstanding as of december are as follows table time deposit  maturities s omitted less than three months three months to six months six months to one year over one year total external borrowings are defined as funding sources available on a national market basis  generally requiring some form of collateralization 
borrowing sources for the company include the federal home loan bank of new york and federal reserve bank of new york  as well as access to the repurchase market through established relationships with primary market security dealers 
the company also had approximately million in fixed and floating rate subordinated debt outstanding at the end of that is held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts 
in the first quarter of  the company elected to redeem early million of variable rate trust preferred securities 
in december  the company completed a sale of million of trust preferred securities 
the securities mature on december  and carry an annual rate equal to the three month libor rate plus 
the company used the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes including the early call of the million of fixed rate trust preferred securities 
at the time of the offering  the company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert the variable rate trust preferred securities into a fixed rate obligation for a term of five years at a fixed rate of as shown in table  year end external borrowings totaled million  a decrease of million from  primarily the result of maturing fhlb borrowings 
external borrowings averaged million or of total funding sources for all of as compared to million or of total funding sources for the decrease in this ratio was primarily attributable to the maturing of certain borrowings and organic deposit growth throughout the year 
as displayed in table on page  the overall mix of funding has shifted over the past two years 
the percentage of funding derived from deposits increased to in from in and in average fhlb borrowings decreased slightly during  while average deposits increased due to organic growth 
during average fhlb borrowings decreased slightly while average deposits increased from both the citizen acquisition and organic growth 
average fhlb borrowings increased during in order to supplement the funding of strong organic loan growth and provide temporary financing for investment purchases made in advance of the significant amount of liquidity that was provided by the citizens branch acquisition 
in addition  drastically lower short term external borrowing rates in the latter part of made this funding alternative more attractive in comparison to other sources such as time deposits  reflecting a very different environment than the one that existed in and the following table summarizes the outstanding balance of borrowings of the company as of december table borrowings s omitted  except rates federal funds purchased federal home loan bank advances commercial loans sold with recourse capital lease obligation subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts balance at end of period daily average during the year maximum month end balance weighted average rate during the year weighted average year end rate the following table shows the contractual maturities of various obligations as of december  table maturities of contractual obligations maturing maturing maturing after one after three within year but years but maturing one year within within after s omitted or less three years five years five years total federal home loan bank advances subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts commercial loans sold with recourse capital lease obligation operating leases unrecognized tax benefits total financial instruments with off balance sheet risk the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments consist primarily of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers  generally having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee 
these commitments consist principally of unused commercial and consumer credit lines 
standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of an underlying contract with a third party 
the credit risks associated with commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are essentially the same as that involved with extending loans to customers and are subject to normal credit policies 
collateral may be obtained based on management s assessment of the customer s creditworthiness 
the fair value of these commitments is immaterial for disclosure 
the contract amount of these off balance sheet financial instruments as of december is as follows table off balance sheet financial instruments s omitted commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit total investments the objective of the company s investment portfolio is to hold low risk  high quality earning assets that provide favorable returns and provide another effective tool to actively manage its asset liability position in order to maximize future net interest income opportunities 
this must be accomplished within the following constraints a implementing certain interest rate risk management strategies which achieve a relatively stable level of net interest income  b providing both the regulatory and operational liquidity necessary to conduct day to day business activities  c considering investment risk weights as determined by the regulatory risk based capital guidelines  and d generating a favorable return without undue compromise of the other requirements 
the book value of the company s investment portfolio increased million to billion at year end during the first quarter of a portion of the company s excess liquidity was used to purchase us treasury securities 
average investment balances including cash equivalents book value basis for increased million or versus the prior year driven by deposit growth and the decline in loan balances 
investment interest income in was million or higher than the prior year as a result of the higher average balances in the portfolio  partially offset by a three basis point decrease in the average investment yield from to 
during interest rates continued to be low  and as a result  cash flows from maturing investments were reinvested at slightly lower interest rates 
partially offsetting this  was the redeployment of cash equivalents into million of us treasury securities at higher yields 
in cash flows from maturing investments were used to fund loan growth rather than be reinvested at unfavorable market rates in the first half of the year 
in the latter half of the year  the company took advantage of favorable market conditions to purchase investments in advance of the liquidity provided by the citizens branch acquisition in november throughout  cash equivalents remained above historical levels  as the company maintained the liquidity provided in the citizens acquisition and organic deposit growth in anticipation of improved investment opportunities in future periods 
a portion of the liquidity generated was deployed during through the purchase of million of securities  principally gnma mortgage backed  obligations of state and political subdivisions and us treasury notes 
other than the pooled trust preferred securities discussed below  the investment portfolio has limited credit risk due to the composition continuing to heavily favor us agency debentures  us agency mortgage backed pass throughs  us agency cmos and municipal bonds 
the us agency debentures  us agency mortgage backed pass throughs and us agency cmos are all aaa rated highest possible rating 
the majority of the municipal bonds are aa rated 
the portfolio does not include any private label mortgage backed securities mbss or private label collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
the overall mix of securities within the portfolio over the last year has changed  with an increase in the proportion of us treasury and agency securities and a decrease in the proportion of mortgage backed securities and small decreases in all other security categories 
sixty two percent of the investment portfolio was classified as available for sale at year end  versus at the end of due to the purchase of million of securities that were categorized as held to maturity 
the net pre tax market value gain over book value for the available for sale portfolio as of december  was million  down million from one year earlier 
this decrease is indicative of the interest rate movements and changing spreads during the respective time periods and the changes in the size and composition of the portfolio 
although not reflected in the financial results of the company  the held to maturity portfolio had an additional million of net unrealized gains as of december  the following table sets forth the amortized cost and market value for the company investment securities portfolio table investment securities amortized amortized amortized cost book fair cost book fair cost book fair s omitted value value value value value value held to maturity portfolio us treasury and agency securities government agency mortgage backed securities obligations of state and political subdivisions other securities total held to maturity portfolio available for sale portfolio us treasury and agency securities obligations of state and political subdivisions corporate debt securities government agency collateralized mortgage obligations pooled trust preferred securities government agency mortgage backed securities marketable equity securities available for sale portfolio net unrealized gain on available for sale portfolio total available for sale portfolio other securities federal home loan bank common stock federal reserve bank common stock other equity securities total other securities total included in the available for sale portfolio  as detailed in table  are pooled trust preferred  class a securities with a current par value of million and unrealized losses of million at december  the underlying collateral of these assets is principally trust preferred securities of smaller regional banks and insurance companies 
the company s securities are in the super senior cash flow tranche of the investment pools 
all other tranches in these pools will incur losses before this tranche is impacted 
an additional of the underlying collateral would have to be in deferral or default concurrently to result in the non receipt of contractual cash flows 
the market for these securities at december  is not active and markets for similar securities are also not active 
the inactivity was evidenced first by a significant widening of the bid ask spread in the brokered markets in which these securities trade and then by a significant decrease in the volume of trades relative to historical levels 
the fair value of these securities was determined by external pricing sources using a discounted cash flow model that incorporated market estimates of interest rates and volatility  as well as  observable quoted prices for similar assets in markets that have not been active 
these assumptions may have a significant effect on the reported fair values 
the use of different assumptions  as well as changes in market conditions  could result in materially different fair values 
a detailed review of the pooled trust preferred securities was completed at december  this review included an analysis of collateral reports  a cash flow analysis  including varying degrees of projected deferral default scenarios  and a review of various financial ratios of the underlying issuers 
based on the analysis performed  significant further deferral defaults and further erosion in other underlying performance conditions would have to exist before the company would incur a loss 
therefore  the company determined an other than temporary impairment did not exist at december  to date  the company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments and expects to fully collect all future contractual principal and interest payments 
the company does not intend to sell the underlying securities 
these securities represent less than of the company s average earning assets for the year ending december  and  thus  are not relied upon for meeting the daily liquidity needs of the company 
subsequent changes in market or credit conditions could change these evaluations

mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are listed based on the contractual maturity 
actual maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations with or without penalties 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s financial statements have been prepared in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
notwithstanding this  inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral  in particular real estate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates  prices or credit risk 
credit risk associated with the company s loan portfolio has been previously discussed in the asset quality section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations starting on page management believes that the tax risk of the company municipal investments associated with potential future changes in statutory  judicial and regulatory actions is minimal 
other than the pooled trust preferred securities discussed beginning on page  the company has a minimal amount of credit risk in the remainder of its investment portfolio 
treasury  agency  mortgage backed and cmo securities comprise of the total portfolio and are aaa rated 
municipal and corporate bonds excluding the pooled trust preferred securities consist of of the total portfolio  of which  carry a minimum rating of a 
the remaining of the portfolio covers local municipal bonds  other investment grade securities and pooled trust preferred securities 
the company does not have any material foreign currency exchange rate risk exposure 
therefore  almost all the market risk in the investment portfolio is related to interest rates 
the ongoing monitoring and management of both interest rate risk and liquidity  in the short and long term time horizons is an important component of the company asset liability management process  which is governed by limits established in the policies reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the policies to the loan asset liability committee alco  which meets each month 
the committee is made up of the company senior management as well as regional and line of business managers who oversee specific earning asset classes and various funding sources 
asset liability management the primary objective of the company s asset liability management process is to maximize earnings and return on capital within acceptable levels of risk 
as the company does not believe it is possible to reliably predict future interest rate movements  it has maintained an appropriate process and set of measurement tools that enable it to identify and quantify sources of interest rate risk in varying rate environments 
the primary tools used by the company in managing interest rate risk are the income simulation model and economic value of equity modeling 
interest rate risk interest rate risk irr can result from the timing differences in the maturity repricing of an institution assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts  the effect of embedded options  such as loan prepayments  interest rate caps floors  and deposit withdrawals  and differences in the behavior of lending and funding rates  sometimes referred to as basis risk 
an example of basis risk would occur if floating rate assets and liabilities  with otherwise identical repricing characteristics  were based on market indexes that were imperfectly correlated 
given the potential types and differing related characteristics of irr  it is important that the company maintain an appropriate process and set of measurement tools that enable it to identify and quantify its primary sources of irr 
the company also recognizes that effective management of irr includes an understanding of when potential adverse changes in interest rates will flow through the income statement 
accordingly  the company will manage its position so that it monitors its exposure to net interest income over both a one year planning horizon and a longer term strategic horizon 
it is the company s objective to manage its exposure to interest rate risk  bearing in mind that it will always be in the business of taking on rate risk and that rate risk immunization is not possible 
also  it is recognized that as exposure to interest rate risk is reduced  so too may net interest margin be reduced 
income simulation income simulation is tested on a wide variety of balance sheet and treasury yield curve scenarios 
the simulation projects changes in net interest income  which are caused by the effect of changes in interest rates 
the model requires management to make assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time in different interest rate environments 
loan and deposit growth rate assumptions are derived from management outlook  as are the assumptions used for new loan yields and deposit rates 
loan prepayment speeds are based on a combination of current industry averages and internal historical prepayments 
balance sheet and yield curve assumptions are analyzed and reviewed by the alco committee regularly 
the following table reflects the company one year net interest income sensitivity  using december  asset and liability levels as a starting point 
the prime rate and federal funds rates are assumed to move up basis points over a month period while moving the long end of the treasury curve to spreads over federal funds that are more consistent with historical norms 
deposit rates are assumed to move in a manner that reflects the historical relationship between deposit rate movement and changes in the federal funds rate  generally reflecting of the movement of the federal funds rate 
cash flows are based on contractual maturity  optionality and amortization schedules along with applicable prepayments derived from internal historical data and external sources 
net interest income sensitivity model calculated increase decrease in projected net income at december  changes in interest rates basis points basis points normalized yield curve in the and models  the rising rate environment reflects an increase in net interest income nii from a flat rate environment while there is interest rate risk exposure if rates were to move to a historical normalized yield curve 
the increase in a rising rate environment is largely due to slower investment cash flows  a higher reinvestment rate and the repricing of assets to higher rates offset by the increase of deposit rates 
over a longer time period the growth in nii improves significantly in a rising rate environment as lower yielding assets mature and are replaced at higher rates 
for the and models  the bank continues to show interest rate risk exposure if the yield curve shifts to a normalized level despite fed funds trading at a range of basis points 
in the basis point model normalized yield curve  longer term rates are lowered to levels more consistent with historical norms 
in this model  net interest income declines during the first twelve months as investment cash flows increase  assets reprice to lower rates and corresponding deposits are assumed to remain constant 
despite fed funds trading near  the company believes long term treasury rates could potentially fall further in this scenario  and thus  the normalized yield curve model tests the impact of this lower treasury rate scenario 
the analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and other factors 
while the assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above 
those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and off balance sheet financial instruments 
such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and shifts in the maturity curve of interest rates and provide management with a long term interest rate risk metric
