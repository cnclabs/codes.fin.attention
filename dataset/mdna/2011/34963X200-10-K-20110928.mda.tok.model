item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial data appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview as a holding company of various product and service entities  we have historically invested in businesses that we believe are undervalued or underperforming  and or in operations that are poised for significant growth 
management s strategic focus is to support the growth of its operations by increasing revenues and revenue streams  managing costs and creating earnings growth 
our operations are largely decentralized from the corporate office 
autonomy is given to subsidiary entities  and there are few integrated business functions ie sales  marketing  purchasing and human resources 
day to day operating decisions are made by subsidiary management teams 
our corporate management team assists in operational decisions when deemed necessary  selects subsidiary management teams and handles capital allocation among our operations 
we were incorporated in the state of delaware in  restructured in and redomesticated to the state of indiana in may prior to  we conducted business mainly in the entertainment industry 
until november   we classified our businesses under five operating segments business solutions  wireless infrastructure  transportation infrastructure  ultraviolet technologies  and electronics integration 
effective november   we approved the sale of all of our remaining operating subsidiaries within four of our five segments wireless infrastructure  transportation infrastructure  ultraviolet infrastructure  and electronics integration 
consequently  as of the effective date of the transaction  our business solutions segment is the company s remaining operating segment 
the sales transaction  combined with other significant events disclosed in note of our financial statements in item  changed the focus of our company in fiscal and thereafter 
this operational change in our company will impact the comparability of our financial information compared to historical data presented in past filings 
key factors affecting or potentially affecting results of operations and financial condition management considers the following factors  events  trends and uncertainties to be important to understanding its results of operations and financial condition holding company over the past eight fiscal periods  we have completed six key acquisitions 
four of these key acquisitions have been in the peo industry 
in february  the company acquired pem  a peo located in arizona 
in march  the company acquired esg  a peo located in utah and colorado 
the company s acquisition of esg enabled the company to expand its geographic presence in the peo marketplace 
in april  we acquired csm  a peo located in nashville  tennessee 
this acquisition of the oldest peo in the state expanded our business solutions segment service offerings 
in april  we acquired jh drew  a construction installer of highway products and commercial structural steel 
this acquisition allowed us to gain entry into the transportation infrastructure business in the midwestern united states 
in october we acquired psm  a peo located in indianapolis  indiana 
this acquisition allowed us to gain entry into the peo market 
in july we acquired nor cote  a specialty ink manufacturer with worldwide distribution channels 
this acquisition allowed us to gain entry into the ultraviolet ink business 
there are several key factors that have affected or potentially may affect our results of operations including the following earnings are dependent on a number of factors including our ability to execute operational strategies and integrate acquired companies into our existing operations 
our historical growth has been due to several significant acquisitions in the past 
future growth in revenues and earnings may not increase at the same rate as historical growth 
certain expenses  such as wages  benefits and rent  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
inflation for medical costs can impact our reserves for workers compensation claims 
our majority shareholder effectively owns of the outstanding common stock and of the outstanding preferred stock of the company 
as a result  he could have a controlling influence in determining the outcome of any corporate matters submitted to our shareholders for approval  including mergers  consolidations  election of directors and any other significant corporate actions 
the interests of this shareholder may differ from the interests of the company s other shareholders and his stock ownership may thereby limit the ability of other shareholders to influence the management and affairs of the company 
business solutions our peos provide services typically managed by a company s internal human resources and accounting departments  including payroll and tax processing and management  worker s compensation and risk management  benefits administration  unemployment administration  human resource compliance services  k and retirement plan administration and employee assessments 
the majority of customer operations are concentrated in the arizona  colorado  indiana  tennessee and utah markets 
financial results may be affected by changes in the state regulatory environments  results under our partially self funded workers compensation insurance plans  and economic conditions

off balance sheet arrangements as is common in the industries in which we operate  we have entered into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets 
our significant off balance sheet transactions include liabilities associated with guaranties and letter of credit obligations 
guaranties a significant portion of our debt and letters of credit are personally guaranteed by the company s chairman 
future changes to these guarantees would affect financing capacity of the company

such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution 
the letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified actions 
if this were to occur  we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit 
depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement  we may also have to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement 
we do not believe that it is likely that any claims will be made under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future 
as of june   we had approximately million in restricted cash primarily to secure obligations under our peo contracts in the business solutions segment 
majority shareholder as of june   our chairman of the board  mr 
carter m

critical accounting policies the company has identified the following policies as critical to its business and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact of these policies is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where these policies affect reported and anticipated financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
preparation of this report requires the company s use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported revenue and expense amounts for the periods being reported 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates these estimates  including those related to the valuation of accounts receivable reserves  the potential impairment of long lived assets and income taxes  and valuation of certain liability reserves 
the company bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable  the results of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
senior management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of these estimates with the company s audit committee 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue and cost recognition in the business solutions segment  psm  csm  and esg and related entities bill clients under their professional services agreement as licensed professional employer organizations collectively the peos  which includes each worksite employee s gross wages  plus additional charges for employment related taxes  benefits  workers compensation insurance  administrative and record keeping  as well as safety  human resources  and regulatory compliance consultation 
most wages  taxes and insurance coverage are provided under the peos federal  state  and local or vendor identification numbers 
no identification or recognition is given to the client when these monies are remitted or calculations are reported 
most calculations or amounts the peos owe the government and its employment insurance vendors are based on the experience levels and activity of the peos with no consideration to client detail 
the peos bill the client their worksite employees gross wages plus an overall service fee that includes components of employment related taxes  employment benefits insurance  and administration of those items 
the component of the service fee related to administration varies  in part  according to the size of the client  the amount and frequency of payroll payments and the method of delivery of such payments 
the component of the service fee related to health  workers compensation and unemployment insurance is based  in part  on the client s historical claims experience 
charges by the peos are invoiced along with each periodic payroll delivered to the client 
the peos report revenues in accordance fasb asc  revenue recognition principal agent considerations 
the peos report revenues on a gross basis  the total amount billed to clients for service fees which includes health and welfare benefit plan fees  workers compensation insurance  unemployment insurance fees  and employment related taxes 
the peos report revenues on a gross basis for such fees because the peos are the primary obligor and deemed to be the principal in these transactions under asc the peos report revenues on a net basis for the amount billed to clients for worksite employee salaries and wages 
this accounting policy of reporting revenue net as an agent versus gross as a principal has no effect on gross profit  operating income  or net income 
the peos account for their revenues using the accrual method of accounting 
under the accrual method of accounting  revenues are recognized in the period in which the worksite employee performs work 
the peos accrue revenues for service fees and payroll taxes relating to work performed by worksite employees but unpaid at the end of each period 
the peos accrue unbilled receivables for payroll taxes and service fees relating to work performed by worksite employees but unpaid at the end of each period 
in addition  the related costs of services are accrued as a liability for the same period 
subsequent to the end of each period  such costs are paid and the related service fees are billed 
consistent with their revenue recognition policy  the peos direct costs do not include the payroll cost of its worksite employees 
the company s direct costs associated with its revenue generating activities are comprised of all other costs related to its worksite employees  such as the employer portion of payroll related taxes  employee benefit plan premiums and workers compensation insurance costs 
valuation of accounts receivable reserves collectability of accounts receivable is evaluated for each subsidiary based on the current economic conditions 
other factors include analysis of historical bad debts  projected losses  and current past due accounts 
the company s accounts receivable reserves decreased by million and million respectively  at june  compared to june  goodwill and other intangible assets material goodwill included in the company s business solutions segment was assessed for impairment 
in making this assessment  management relies on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  and transactions and market place data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
since management s judgment is involved in performing goodwill and other intangible assets valuation analyses  there is risk that the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated or understated 
the company has elected to perform the annual impairment assessment of recorded goodwill as required by asc as of the end of fiscal first quarter 
the company did not recognize any impairment of goodwill or intangible assets for years ended june  and june  impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of its long lived assets in accordance with fasb asc  property  plant  and equipment  which generally requires the company to assess these assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company considers historical performances and future estimated results in its evaluation of potential impairment and then compares the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated non discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by comparing projected individual segment discounted cash flows to the asset segment carrying values 
the estimation of fair value is measured by discounting expected future cash flows at the discount rate the company utilizes to evaluate potential investments 
actual results may differ from these estimates and as a result the estimation of fair values may be adjusted in the future 
income taxes deferred tax assets are recognized for taxable temporary differences  tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards 
these assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of june   management has determined that a valuation allowance against the company s million component of deferred tax assets generated by the net operating loss carry forward of million is necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized 
as of june   management has also determined that a million valuation allowance against the company s million of deferred tax assets generated by book versus tax differences of certain assets and liabilities is necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized 
the company released million of the valuation allowance in fiscal due to the positive earnings in the company s operations and projected earnings in fiscal and as of june   management has determined that a valuation allowance against the company s million component of deferred tax assets generated by the net operating loss carry forward of million is necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized 
as of june   management has also determined that a million valuation allowance against the company s million of deferred tax assets generated by book versus tax differences of certain assets and liabilities is necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized 
the company released million of the valuation allowance in fiscal due to the positive earnings in the company s operations and projected earnings in fiscal and in addition  management is required to estimate taxable income for future years by taxing jurisdictions and to consider this when making its judgment to determine whether or not to record a valuation allowance for part or all of a deferred tax asset 
a one percent change in the company s overall statutory tax rate for would not have a material effect in the carrying value of the net deferred tax assets or liabilities 
the company has operations in multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve 
accruals of tax contingencies require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of tax audits 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
workmen s compensation reserves the company s business solutions segment recognizes significant reserves in relation to its partially self funded workers compensation programs based on a the amount of past claims incurred and b the estimated time lag to report and pay such claims 
our deductible under our workers compensation insurance at psm and csm is million with an aggregate liability limit of approximately million 
our deductible under the esg lua policy is million with no aggregate liability 
the reserve recognized for unpaid workers compensation benefits on the company s consolidated balance sheet is million for which approximately million of cash is restricted on the company s consolidated balance sheet for the year ended june  new accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this report for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash and cash equivalents as of june  was million and is primarily invested in money market interest bearing accounts
