item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto 
our fiscal year ends december this document contains certain forward looking statements including  among others  anticipated trends in our financial condition and results of operations and our business strategy 
these forward looking statements are based largely on our current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
see part i  item a  risk factors 
actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements 
important factors to consider in evaluating such forward looking statements include i changes in external factors or in our internal budgeting process which might impact trends in our results of operations  ii unanticipated working capital or other cash requirements  iii changes in our business strategy or an inability to execute our strategy due to unanticipated changes in the industries in which we operate  and iv various competitive market factors that may prevent us from competing successfully in the marketplace 
overview we design and manufacture miniature displays  which we refer to as oled on silicon microdisplays  and microdisplay modules for virtual imaging  primarily for incorporation into the products of other manufacturers 
microdisplays are typically smaller than many postage stamps  but when viewed through a magnifier they can contain all of the information appearing on a high resolution personal computer screen 
our microdisplays use organic light emitting diodes  or oleds  which emit light themselves when a current is passed through the device 
our technology permits oleds to be coated onto silicon chips to produce high resolution oled on silicon microdisplays 
we believe that our oled on silicon microdisplays offer a number of advantages in near to the eye applications over other current microdisplay technologies  including lower power requirements  less weight  fast video speed without flicker  and wider viewing angles 
in addition  many computer and video electronic system functions can be built directly into the oled on silicon microdisplay  resulting in compact systems with lower expected overall system costs relative to alternate microdisplay technologies 
since our inception in through  we derived the majority of our revenues from fees paid to us under research and development contracts  primarily with the us government 
we have devoted significant resources to the development and commercial launch of our products including our z gaming headset 
we commenced limited initial sales of our svga microdisplay in may and commenced shipping samples of our svga d microdisplay in february from inception to december   we have recognized an aggregate of approximately million from sales of our products 
as of january   we had a backlog of approximately million in products ordered for delivery through december  at february   we had a backlog of million in products ordered for delivery through december  this backlog consists of non binding purchase orders and purchase agreements 
these products are being applied or considered for near eye and headset applications in products such as thermal imagers  night vision goggles  entertainment headsets  handheld internet and telecommunication appliances  viewfinders  and wearable computers to be manufactured by original equipment manufacturer oem customers 
we have also shipped our z dvisor personal display systems 
in addition to marketing oled on silicon microdisplays as components  we also offer microdisplays as an integrated package  which we call microviewer that includes a compact lens for viewing the microdisplay and electronic interfaces to convert the signal from our customer product into a viewable image on the microdisplay 
we have developed a strong portfolio of our own patents  manufacturing know how and technology to create high performance oled on silicon microdisplays and related optical systems 
we believe our technology and intellectual property portfolio  gives us a leadership position in oled and oled on silicon microdisplay technology 
we believe that we are the only company to demonstrate publicly  market and produce in significant quantities full color small molecule oled on silicon microdisplays 
in  we continued to advance our technology 
we are making good progress toward developing a hd resolution display that is under inch in diagonal for the us army telemedicine and technology research center tatrc 
we are making great strides in oled architectures that could double or triple oled efficiency 
we continue to place our microdisplays with additional customers 
in  we announced a million notice of contract award from itt  a new customer 
company history as of january   we were no longer classified as a development stage company 
we transitioned to manufacturing our product and have significantly increased our marketing  sales  and research and development efforts  and expanded our operating infrastructure 
currently  most of our operating expenses are labor related and semi fixed 
if we are unable to generate significant revenues  our net income in any given period could be less than expected 
critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
not all of the accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the following policies could be deemed to be critical within the sec definition 
revenue and cost recognition revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  such as when a purchase order or contract is received from the customer  the price is fixed  title and risk of loss to the goods has changed and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
products sold directly to consumers have a thirty day right of return 
revenue on consumer products is deferred until the right of return has expired 
revenues from research and development activities relating to firm fixed price contracts and cost type contracts are generally recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting as costs are incurred cost to cost basis 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and an allocation of allowable indirect costs as defined by each contract  as periodically adjusted to reflect revised agreed upon rates 
these rates are subject to audit by the other party 
product warranty we offer a one year product replacement warranty 
in general  our standard policy is to repair or replace the defective products 
we accrue for estimated returns of defective products at the time revenue is recognized based on historical activity as well as for specific known product issues 
the determination of these accruals requires us to make estimates of the frequency and extent of warranty activity and estimate future costs to replace the products under warranty 
if the actual warranty activity and or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from these estimates  adjustments to cost of revenue may be required in future periods 
use of estimates in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management utilizes certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments related to  among others  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty reserves  inventory reserves  stock based compensation expense  deferred tax asset valuation allowances  litigation and other loss contingencies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
fair value of financial instruments emagin s cash  cash equivalents  accounts receivable  short term investments  and accounts payable are stated at cost which approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments 
in addition  the long term investments are stated at cost which approximates fair value 
stock based compensation emagin maintains several stock equity incentive plans 
the employee stock purchase plan the espp provides our employees with the opportunity to purchase common stock through payroll deductions 
employees may purchase stock semi annually at a price that is of the fair market value at certain plan defined dates 
as of december   the number of shares of common stock available for issuance was  as of december   the plan had not been implemented 
the stock option plan the plan provides for grants of shares of common stock and options to purchase shares of common stock to employees  officers  directors and consultants 
under the plan  an iso grant is granted at the market value of our common stock at the date of the grant and a non iso is granted at a price not to be less than of the market value of the common stock 
these options have a term of up to years and vest over a schedule determined by the board of directors  generally over a five year period 
the amended plan provides for an annual increase in common stock available for issuance by of the diluted shares outstanding on january of each year for a period of years which commenced january  in  there were  options granted from the plan 
the incentive stock plan the plan adopted and approved by the board of directors on november  provides for shares of common stock and options to purchase shares of common stock to employees  officers  directors and consultants 
the plan has an aggregate of  shares 
in  there were no options granted from this plan 
we account for the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors by estimating the fair value of stock awards at the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
stock based compensation expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures and is amortized over the vesting period using the straight line method 
see note of the consolidated financial statements stock compensation for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for accounting and tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
operating losses and tax credits  to the extent not already utilized to offset taxable income also represent deferred tax assets 
we must assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
from inception through the third quarter of  we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as we were unable to determine that it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize them 
during the years ended december   and  we utilized million  million  and million  respectively  of historical net operating losses to offset taxable income in each of these periods 
at december   we had deferred tax assets  including net operating losses and tax credits that would offset million of future taxable income 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would generate future taxable income and  as a result  recorded a million reduction of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance and corresponding income tax benefit 
in determining future taxable income  assumptions are made to forecast operating income  the reversal of temporary timing differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
management uses significant judgment in the assumptions it uses to forecast future taxable income which are consistent with the forecasts used to manage the business 
realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon future earnings which there is uncertainty as to the timing 
we will continue to monitor the realizability of the deferred tax asset 
as of december   the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets was million 
the valuation allowance will be maintained until further sufficient positive evidence exists to support an additional reduction in the valuation allowance 
results of operations the following table presents certain financial data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated

we have net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income in  however we are subject to alternative minimum tax amt 
for the year ended december   the income tax expense was thousand as we had a net loss 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues  results of operations  liquidity or capital expenditures 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents  and investments in certificates of deposit cds

the credit facility will automatically renew on september  for a one year term unless written notice is provided 
we did not draw on our credit facility in the credit facility contains the customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of december  as we have reported  our business continues to experience revenue growth 
this trend  if it continues  may result in higher accounts receivable levels and may require increased production and or higher inventory levels 
we anticipate that our cash needs to fund these requirements as well as other operating or investing cash requirements over the next twelve months will be less than our current cash on hand and the cash we anticipate generating from operations 
we anticipate that we will not require additional funds over the next twelve months other than perhaps for discretionary capital spending 
if unanticipated events arise during the next twelve months  we believe we can raise sufficient funds 
however  if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds  we may have to reduce the size of our organization and or be forced to reduce and or curtail our production and operations  all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects
