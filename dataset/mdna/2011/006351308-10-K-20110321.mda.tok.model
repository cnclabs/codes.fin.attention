item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations marketing marketing revenues  operating earnings and depreciation are as follows in thousands revenues crude oil natural gas refined products total operating earnings loss crude oil natural gas refined products total depreciation crude oil natural gas refined products total supplemental volume and price information is field level purchases per day crude oil barrels natural gas mmbtu s average purchase price crude oil per barrel natural gas per mmbtu reflects the volume purchased from third parties at the oil and natural gas field level and pipeline pooling points 
comparison to crude oil revenues were elevated by percent in due to both volume and price increases 
average crude oil prices increased by percent and crude oil lease level volumes improved by percent as shown in the table above 
total revenue grew by less than the amount indicated by pricing because certain buy sell arrangements are reported on a net revenue basis and as a result  a change in the company s customer mix will increase or decrease comparative reported revenues 
during a larger portion of sales were reported on a net revenue basis  partially offsetting the effect of increased average prices and volumes 
increased crude oil prices boosted operating earnings during the average acquisition price of crude oil moved from per barrel at the beginning of the year to per barrel for december resulting in inventory liquidation gains totaling  similarly  during  crude oil prices rose from the per barrel range in january to the per barrel range by december producing a  inventory liquidation gain 
as of december   the company held  barrels of crude oil inventory at an average price of per barrel 
diesel fuel expense which tends to fluctuate in tandem with crude oil prices also has a significant impact on operating earnings 
a relatively low level of diesel fuel costs during  served to improve comparative operating earnings for such year 
the impact on crude oil operating earnings from inventory liquidation gains and diesel fuel cost is summarized as follows in thousands as reported operating earnings inventory liquidation gains diesel fuel expense during  the company has generally experienced an increase in per unit margins as the increasing cost to procure supply has lagged end market pricing 
this pricing scenario has been driven  in large part  by recent new production trends in the eagle ford shale formation of south texas 
this trend looks to continue as the eagle ford formation is currently an active area for drilling for several of the company s suppliers 
natural gas sales are reported net of underlying natural gas purchase costs and thus reflect gross margin 
as shown above  gross margins were reduced during as average field level purchase volumes were off percent for the period see table above 
current volume declines resulted from the company s suppliers curtailing drilling activity due to lower natural gas prices 
in addition  development of the united states natural gas infrastructure including more diverse areas of production and expanded pipeline and storage capacity have served to reduce purchase opportunities and per unit margins 
in contrast to the gross margin trend  the company s natural gas marketing personnel were able to adjust marketplace strategy and capture additional margin opportunities which bolstered operating earnings for the current year 
operating earnings for the refined products segment improved in as the united states economy stabilized 
both and suffered from the downturn in the domestic economy which began during the third quarter of due to customer financial stability concerns  refined product operating earnings were additionally impacted in and when the bad debt provision was increased by approximately  and  respectively 
the company focused on cost controls and instituted personnel cut backs in the fourth quarter of to restore profitability to this segment 
comparison to crude oil revenues declined for by percent relative to because of significantly lower average crude oil prices as shown in the table above 
while comparative overall crude oil prices were reduced in  the direction of change in price was generally increasing during the period leading to the operating gains as discussed above 
as shown on the comparative table above  natural gas gross margins spiked in at  this result occurred because in the company elected to ship more of its gas supply on the interstate and intrastate pipeline systems 
this strategy boosted unit gross margins but also increased pipeline transportation expense  a deduction for operating margins 
historically  prices received for crude oil and natural gas as well as derivative products have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility expected to continue 
see also discussion under item a risk factors 
transportation the transportation segment revenues and operating earnings were as follows in thousands amount change amount change amount change revenues operating earnings depreciation represents the percentage increase decrease from the prior year 
comparison to revenues and operating results improved for the transportation segment in due to increased customer demand 
the company s customers predominately consist of the domestic petrochemical industry and demand for such products has substantially recovered from the slow down occurring in serving to improve customer demand was a recovering united states economy  relatively low natural gas prices and improved export demand for petrochemicals 
in addition  during the recent economic downturn  the trucking industry reduced capacity by retiring older units without replacement 
following recent demand improvement  industry capacity has been strained allowing rate increases and improved overall profitability 
as transportation revenues increase or decrease  operating earnings will typically increase or decrease at an accelerated rate 
this trend results because the fixed cost components of the company s operation do not vary with changing revenues 
as currently configured  operating earnings project at break even levels when annual revenues average approximately million 
above that level  operating earnings will grow and below that level losses result 
transportation segment depreciation increased in as older fully depreciated tractor units were replaced with new model year vehicles 
the purchase of current model year tractor and trailer units at an estimated cost of approximately million is planned for through midway comparison to revenues and operating results turned downward for the transportation segment in due to reduced customer demand beginning in the third quarter of the national economic recession occurring at the time severely and adversely impacted this segment of the company s business 
typically  as revenues decline  operating earnings decline at a faster rate  as measured by percentage  due to the fixed cost components of operating costs 
in march  the company instituted cost cutting measures including a reduction in personnel levels in order to better align costs with a lower level of revenues 
as a result  the rate of decline in operating earnings slowed relative to the rate of decline in revenues beginning in the second quarter of and these cost cutting measures contributed to a stronger than normal level of improvement in when customer demand resumed 
oil and gas oil and gas segment revenues and operating earnings are primarily derived from crude oil and natural gas production volumes and prices 
comparative amounts for revenues  operating earnings and depreciation and depletion were as follows in thousands amount change amount change amount change revenues operating earnings loss depreciation and depletion producing property impairments represents the percentage increase decrease from the prior year 
the revenue and earnings improvement for the oil and gas segment is attributable to crude oil and natural gas volume and price increases as shown in the table below 
volumes improved with the results of recent drilling efforts 
operating earnings in also benefited from reduced exploration and impairment expenses as shown in the second table below 
as shown above  depreciation and depletion expense was reduced in because a significant decline in hydrocarbon prices at year end december  caused significant producing property impairment provisions to be recorded during and such charges reduced the level of capitalized costs for amortizing in comparative volumes and prices were as follows production volumes crude oil bbls bbls bbls natural gas mcf mcf mcf average price crude oil bbls bbls bbls natural gas mcf mcf mcf comparative exploration and impairment costs were as follows in thousands dry hole expense prospect impairment seismic and geological total during  the company participated in the drilling of wells with successful and dry holes

the company s current drilling and exploration efforts are primarily focused as follows east texas project beginning in  the company began acquiring acreage interests in nacogdoches and shelby counties of east texas 
subsequent drilling activity produced productive wells through the end of drilling activity in the area s haynesville shale formation increased dramatically in  primarily to maintain the company s leasehold position for future development drilling as natural gas prices improve 
twenty two successful wells were drilled with no dry holes during  bringing the total number of haynesville shale wells to thirty four including wells in progress at year end 
last year the company  with its partner  acquired an additional  acres in angelina county due south of the company s original acreage position 
acreage maintained by production now totals approximately  gross acres with approximately  gross acres remaining to be drilled 
the company s working interest in this project varies from two percent to five percent and the company s acreage position net to its interest is approximately  acres 
thirty four additional wells are planned in this area in austin county project in  the company elected to participate in the exploitation of an existing d seismic survey over the raccoon bend dome located in austin county  texas 
the oil prospect was to test deeper zones that had not been adequately evaluated by earlier drilling 
seven wells were drilled in bringing the total number of wells drilled in the prospect to eleven with eight of the eleven successfully completed as oil wells 
drilling on this project will continue in with three or four wells planned back to back during the second quarter 
the operator of the property has identified additional locations that may also be drilled in the company has an working interest in this prospect 
south central kansas project the company is participating with a percent working interest in a large d seismic survey in south central kansas and has a working interest in  gross acres 
a number of prospects have been identified and four wells were drilled in two of these wells were completed with marginal success and a third well is currently testing after frac 
the fourth well was not successful 
the seismic is being reevaluated and additional drilling is planned for west texas project beginning in  the company participated in the acquisition and development of approximately  acres in the wolfcamp formation of irion county  texas 
initial results did not meet expectations and a second third party operator was brought into the project 
twelve wolfcamp shale wells have now been drilled with seven such wells being horizontal developments 
recent results are positive with initial flow rates over barrels of oil per day 
twenty four wells are planned for drilling on this acreage in and the company has an approximate two percent working interest in this project 
subsequent property sale in january  the company completed the sale of its interest in certain producing oil and gas properties located in the on shore gulf coast region of texas 
proceeds from the sale totaled million and the company will report a pre tax gain of approximately million from this transaction during the first quarter of total proved reserves sold were approximately  barrels of crude oil and  mcf of natural gas 
sales negotiations were conducted by the third party operator of the properties on behalf of all working interest owners and the transaction was completed with a separate third party investment entity 
the company s proportionate interest in the transaction was approximately percent and the company elected to participate in the sale due to attractive pricing 
proceeds from the sale will be used for general working capital purposes 
general and administrative  interest income and income tax general and administrative expenses were consistent during the five year review period ending december  except during such costs were elevated due to federally mandated sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
interest income declined for and as interest rates on overnight deposits declined to near zero following the significant turmoil that occurred in the financial markets during the fall of the provision for income taxes is based on federal and state tax rates and variations are consistent with taxable income in the respective accounting periods 
outlook the marketing and transportation segments have been performing at expected levels and business currently looks to be holding firm 
increased crude oil production in the company s south texas marketing area is also occurring as the eagle ford shale play is being developed by third party operators in the region 
in contrast to the recent strength in the crude oil markets  natural gas prices have been in decline  falling at times to below per mcf 
despite low natural gas prices  the company s recent drilling success has improved oil and gas segment earnings and management believes this earnings trend will continue 
the company has the following major objectives for maintain marketing operating earnings at the million level exclusive of inventory valuation gains or losses 
maintain transportation operating earnings at the million level 
establish oil and gas operating earnings at the million level and replace production with current reserve additions 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity primarily derives from net cash provided from operating activities  which was   and  for each of  and  respectively 
as of december  and  the company had no bank debt or other forms of debenture obligations 
cash and cash equivalents totaled  as of december   and such balances are maintained in order to meet the timing of day to day cash needs 
working capital  the excess of current assets over current liabilities  totaled  as of december  capital expenditures during included  for marketing and transportation equipment additions  primarily consisting of trucks tractors  and  in property additions associated with oil and gas exploration and production activities 
for  the company anticipates expending an additional approximately million on oil and gas exploration projects 
in addition  approximately million will be expended during for the purchase of trucks tractors for the transportation segment and approximately million will be expended for the purchase of trucks tractors and trailers for the marketing segment with funding for such purchase from available cash flow 
these units will serve to replace older units and to increase the marketing and transportation fleets 
funding for these projects will be from operating cash flow and available working capital 
however  the company has also initiated discussion with a bank about establishing a working capital line of credit in order to provide an additional source of capital should the need arise to fund the anticipated projects 
further  within certain constraints  the proposed projects can be delayed or cancelled should funding become unavailable 
from time to time  the company may make cash prepayments to certain suppliers of crude oil and natural gas for the company s marketing operations 
such prepayments totaled  as of december  and such amounts will be recouped and advanced from month to month as the suppliers deliver product to the company 
the company also requires certain counterparties to post cash collateral with the company in order to support their purchase from the company 
such cash collateral held by the company totaled  as of december  the company also maintains a stand by letter of credit facility with wells fargo bank to provide for the issuance of stand by letters of credit to the company s suppliers of crude oil and natural gas see note to financial statements 
the issuance of stand by letters of credit enables the company to avoid posting cash collateral when procuring crude oil and natural gas supply 
as of december   letters of credit outstanding totaled million 
management believes current cash balances  together with expected cash generated from future operations  will be sufficient to meet short term and long term liquidity needs 
historically  the company pays an annual dividend in the fourth quarter of each year  and the company paid a 
per common share dividend or  to shareholders of record as of december  the most significant item affecting future increases or decreases in liquidity is earnings from operations and such earnings are dependent on the success of future operations see item a 
risk factors in this annual report of form k 
off balance sheet arrangements the company maintains certain operating lease arrangements primarily with independent truck owner operators in order to provide truck tractor equipment for the company s fleet 
any commitments with independent truck owner operators are on a month to month basis 
in addition  the company has entered into certain lease and terminal access contracts in order to provide tank storage and dock access for its crude oil marketing business 
such contracts require certain minimum monthly payments for the term of the contracts 
all operating lease commitments qualify for off balance sheet treatment 
rental expense for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
as of december   rental commitments under long term non cancelable operating leases and terminal arrangements for the next five years are payable as follows      and  thereafter 
contractual cash obligations the company has no capital lease obligations 
the company has entered into certain operating leasing arrangements and terminal access agreements for tankage  truck tractors  trailers and office space 
a summary of the payment periods for contractual cash obligations is as follows in thousands thereafter total lease payments in addition to its lease financing obligations  the company is also committed to purchase certain quantities of crude oil and natural gas in connection with its marketing activities 
such commodity purchase obligations are the basis for commodity sales  which generate the cash flow necessary to meet such purchase obligations 
approximate commodity purchase obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands january remaining thereafter total crude oil natural gas insurance from time to time  the marketplace for all forms of insurance enters into periods of severe cost increases 
in the past  during such cyclical periods  the company has seen costs escalate to the point where desired levels of insurance were either unavailable or unaffordable 
the company s primary insurance needs are in the areas of worker s compensation  automobile and umbrella coverage for its trucking fleet and medical insurance for employees 
during each of  and  insurance costs were stable and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
overall insurance cost may experience renewed rate increases during since the company is generally unable to pass on such cost increases  any increase will need to be absorbed by existing operations 
competition in all phases of its operations  the company encounters strong competition from a number of entities 
many of these competitors possess financial resources substantially in excess of those of the company 
the company faces competition principally in establishing trade credit  pricing of available materials and quality of service 
in its oil and gas operation  the company also competes for the acquisition of mineral properties 
the company marketing division competes with major oil companies and other large industrial concerns that own or control significant refining and marketing facilities 
these major oil companies may offer their products to others on more favorable terms than those available to the company 
from time to time in recent years  there have been supply imbalances for crude oil and natural gas in the marketplace 
this in turn has led to significant fluctuations in prices for crude oil and natural gas 
as a result  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding both the future market price for crude oil and natural gas and the available margin spread between wholesale acquisition costs and sales realization 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates fair value accounting the company enters into certain forward commodity contracts that are required to be recorded at fair value and such contracts are recorded as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the derivatives qualify for  and the company elects  cash flow hedge accounting 
the company had no contracts designated for hedge accounting during  and the company utilizes a market approach to valuing its commodity contracts 
on a contract by contract  forward month by forward month basis  the company obtains observable market data for valuing its contracts 
such contracts typically have durations that are less than months 
as of december   all of the company s market value measurements were based on either quoted prices in active markets level inputs or from inputs based on observable market data level inputs 
see discussion under fair value measurements in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s fair value contracts give rise to market risk  which represents the potential loss that may result from a change in the market value of a particular commitment 
the company monitors and manages its exposure to market risk to ensure compliance with the company s risk management policies 
such policies are regularly assessed to ensure their appropriateness given management s objectives  strategies and current market conditions 
trade accounts accounts receivable and accounts payable typically represent the most significant assets and liabilities of the company 
particularly within the company s energy marketing  oil and gas exploration  and production operations  there is a high degree of interdependence with and reliance upon third parties including transaction counterparties to provide adequate information for the proper recording of amounts receivable or payable 
substantially all such third parties are larger firms providing the company with the source documents for recording trade activity 
it is commonplace for these entities to retroactively adjust or correct such documents 
this typically requires the company to absorb  benefit from  or pass along such corrections to another third party 
due to the volume of and complexity of transactions and the high degree of interdependence with third parties  this is a difficult area to control and manage 
the company manages this process by participating in a monthly settlement process with each of its counterparties 
ongoing account balances are monitored monthly and the company attempts to gain the cooperation of such counterparties to reconcile outstanding balances 
the company also places great emphasis on collecting cash balances due and paying only bonafide and properly supported claims 
in addition  the company maintains and monitors its bad debt allowance 
nevertheless a degree of risk remains due to the custom and practices of the industry 
oil and gas reserve estimate the value of the capitalized cost of oil and natural gas exploration and production related assets are dependent on underlying oil and natural gas reserve estimates 
reserve estimates are based on many subjective factors 
the accuracy of reserve estimates depends on the quantity and quality of geological data  production performance data and reservoir engineering data  the pricing assumptions utilized as well as the skill and judgment of petroleum engineers in interpreting such data 
the process of estimating reserves requires frequent revision of estimates usually on an annual basis as additional information becomes available 
calculations of estimated future oil and natural gas revenues are also based on estimates of the timing of oil and natural gas production  and there are no assurances that the actual timing of production will conform to or approximate such estimates 
also  certain assumptions must be made with respect to pricing 
the company s estimates assume prices will remain constant from the date of the engineer s estimates  except for changes reflected under natural gas sales contracts 
there can be no assurance that actual future prices will not vary as industry conditions  governmental regulation  political conditions  economic conditions  weather conditions  market uncertainty and other factors impact the market price for oil and natural gas 
the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting  so only costs including development dry hole costs associated with producing oil and natural gas wells are capitalized 
estimated oil and natural gas reserve quantities are the basis for the rate of amortization under the company s units of production method for depreciating  depleting and amortizing of oil and natural gas properties 
estimated oil and natural gas reserve values also provide the standard for the company s periodic review of oil and natural gas properties for impairment 
contingencies from time to time as incident to its operations  the company becomes involved in various accidents  lawsuits and or disputes 
primarily as an operator of an extensive trucking fleet  the company is a party to motor vehicle accidents  worker compensation claims or other items of general liability as are typical for the industry 
in addition  the company has extensive operations that must comply with a wide variety of tax laws  environmental laws and labor laws  among others 
should an incident occur  management evaluates the claim based on its nature  the facts and circumstances and the applicability of insurance coverage 
to the extent management believes that such event may impact the financial condition of the company  management will estimate the monetary value of the claim and make appropriate accruals or disclosure as provided in the appropriate accounting literature guidelines 
revenue recognition the company s crude oil  natural gas and refined products marketing customers are invoiced daily or monthly based on contractually agreed upon terms 
revenue is recognized in the month in which the physical product is delivered to the customer 
where required  the company also recognizes fair value or mark to market gains and losses related to its commodity activities 
a detailed discussion of the company s revenue recognition policy is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
transportation segment customers are invoiced  and the related revenue is recognized as the service is provided 
oil and natural gas revenue from the company s interests in producing wells is recognized as title and physical possession of the oil and natural gas passes to the purchaser 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission released final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting to revise the existing regulation s k and regulation s x reporting requirements to align with current industry practices and technological advances 
the new disclosure requirements include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes 
in addition  the new disclosure requirements require a company to a disclose its internal control over reserves estimation and report the independence and qualification of its reserves preparer or auditor  b file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conducts a reserve audit  c report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than period end prices and d disclose the development of any proved undeveloped reserves pud s including the total quantity of pud s at year end  material changes to pud s during the year  investments and progress toward the development of pud s and an explanation of the reasons why material concentrations of pud s have remained undeveloped for five years or more after disclosure as pud s 
the accounting changes resulting from changes in definitions and pricing assumptions should be treated as a change in accounting principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate  which is to be applied prospectively 
the disclosures required by this ruling became effective beginning december  in january  the fasb issued fasb accounting standards update asu no 
 oil and gas reserve estimations and disclosures asu no 

this update aligns the current oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements of the extractive industries oil and gas topic of the asc asc topic with the changes required by the sec final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting  as discussed above 
asu no 
expands the disclosures required for equity method investments  revises the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include nontraditional resources in reserves unless not intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas  amends the definition of proved oil and gas reserves to require month average pricing in estimating reserves  amends and adds definitions in the master glossary that is used in estimating proved oil and gas quantities and provides guidance on geographic area with respect to disclosure of information about significant reserves 
asu no 
must be applied prospectively as a change in accounting principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate 
the company adopted asu no 
effective december  in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu  which amends the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the asc asc topic 
among other provisions  asc topic establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the relative reliability of inputs used in fair value measurements 
the hierarchy gives highest priority to level inputs that represent unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date 
level inputs are directly or indirectly observable inputs other than quoted prices included within level level inputs are unobservable inputs and have the lowest priority in the hierarchy 
this amendment requires new disclosures on the value of  and the reason for  transfers in and out of levels and of the fair value hierarchy and additional disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements within level fair value measurements 
asu also clarifies existing disclosure requirements on levels of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the requirement to provide additional disclosures regarding level measurements which is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  management believes the impact of other recently issued standards and updates  which are not yet effective  will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk includes potential adverse changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk the company had no long term debt outstanding at december  and a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in the floating rate would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  commodity price risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its marketing and production of crude oil and natural gas 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing spot prices applicable to oil and gas 
commodity price risk in the company s marketing operations represents the potential loss that may result from a change in the market value of an asset or a commitment 
from time to time  the company enters into forward contracts to minimize or hedge the impact of market fluctuations on its purchases of crude oil and natural gas 
the company may also enter into price support contracts with certain customers to secure a floor price on the purchase of certain supply 
in each instance  the company locks in a separate matching price support contract with a third party in order to minimize the risk of these financial instruments 
substantially all forward contracts fall within a six month to eighteen month term with no contracts extending longer than two years in duration 
certain forward contracts are recorded at fair value  depending on management s assessments of numerous accounting standards and positions that comply with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the fair value of such contracts is reflected in the balance sheet as fair value assets and liabilities and any revaluation is recognized on a net basis in the company s results of operations 
see discussion under fair value measurements in note to the consolidated financial statements 
historically  prices received for oil and natural gas sales have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility expected to continue 
from january  through december  natural gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mmbtu to a monthly high of per mmbtu 
crude oil prices ranged from a monthly average low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during the same period 
a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in average natural gas and crude oil prices  assuming no changes in volume levels  would have reduced earnings by approximately  and  for the comparative years ended december  and  respectively
