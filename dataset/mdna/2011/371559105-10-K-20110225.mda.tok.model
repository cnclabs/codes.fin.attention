geographic information for financial information with respect to each of our geographic areas  see note to our consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv 
item exhibits  financial statement schedules of this annual report 
traffic rail traffic shipped on our rail lines can be categorized as interline  local or overhead traffic 
interline traffic either originates or terminates with customers located along a rail line and is interchanged with other rail carriers 
local traffic both originates and terminates on the same rail line and does not involve other carriers 
overhead traffic passes over the line from one connecting rail carrier to another without the carload originating or terminating on the line 
unlike overhead traffic  interline and local traffic provide us with a more stable source of revenues because this traffic represents shipments to and or from customers located along our rail lines and is less susceptible to competition from other rail routes or other modes of transportation 
in  revenues generated from interline and local traffic constituted approximately of our freight revenues 
seasonality of operations typically  we experience relatively lower revenues in north america in the first and fourth quarters of each year as the winter season and colder weather in north america tend to reduce shipments of certain products such as construction materials 
in addition  due to adverse winter weather conditions  we also tend to incur higher operating costs during the first and fourth quarters 
we typically initiate capital projects in north america in the second and third quarters when weather conditions are more favorable 
in addition  as a result of the freightlink acquisition  we expect to experience relatively lower revenues in australia in the first quarter of each year as a result of the wet season ie monsoonal rains 
employees as of december   our railroads and industrial switching locations had  full time employees 
of this total  employees are union members 
our railroads have contracts with unions 
we are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to of those agreements 
we are also a party to employee association agreements covering an additional employees who are not represented by a national labor organization 
the railway labor act rla governs the labor relations of employers and employees engaged in the railroad industry in the united states 
the rla establishes the right of railroad employees to organize and bargain collectively along craft or class lines and imposes a duty upon carriers and their employees to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain collective bargaining agreements 
le code canadian du travail and the federal workplace relations act govern the labor relations of employers and employees engaged in the railroad industry in canada and australia  respectively 
the rla and foreign labor regulations contain detailed procedures that must be exhausted before a lawful work stoppage may occur 
in the netherlands  rrf is not party to any collective bargaining agreements 
we believe we maintain positive working relationships with our employees 

table of contents safety our safety program involves all employees and focuses on the prevention of accidents and injuries 
operating personnel are trained and certified in train operations  the transportation of hazardous materials  safety and operating rules and governmental rules and regulations 
we also participate in safety committees of the aar  governmental and industry sponsored safety programs and the american short line and regional railroad association safety committee 
our reportable injury frequency rate  which is defined by the federal railroad administration fra as reportable injuries per  man hours worked  was and in and  respectively 
the average injuries per  man hours worked for all united states short line railroads was in through november and in insurance we maintain liability and property insurance coverage 
our primary liability policies have self insured retentions of up to million per occurrence 
with respect to the transportation of hazardous commodities  our liability policy covers sudden releases of hazardous materials  including expenses related to evacuation  as a result of a railroad accident 
personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under our liability policies 
our property damage policies have various self insured retentions  which vary based on type and location of the incident  that are generally less than million 
employees of our united states railroads are covered by the federal employers liability act fela  a fault based system under which claims resulting from injuries and deaths of railroad employees are settled by negotiation or litigation 
fela related claims are covered under our liability policies 
employees of our industrial switching business are covered under workers compensation policies 
employees of our canadian railroads are covered by the applicable provincial workers compensation policy 
employees of our australian operations are covered by the respective state based workers compensation legislation in australia 
employees of rrf are covered by the workers compensation legislation of the netherlands 
we believe our insurance coverage is adequate given our experience and the experience of the rail industry within the geographies we operate 
competition in north america  each of our railroads is typically the only rail carrier directly serving our customers 
in australia and the netherlands  however  our customers have access to other rail carriers under the open access regimes 
in addition  our railroads compete directly with other modes of transportation  principally highway competition from motor carriers and  on some routes  ship  barge and pipeline operators 
competition is based primarily upon the rate charged and the transit time required  as well as the quality and reliability of the service provided 
most of the freight we handle is interchanged with other railroads prior to reaching its final destination 
as a result  to the extent that other rail carriers are involved in transporting a shipment  we cannot necessarily control the cost and quality of such service 
to the extent that highway competition is involved  the degree of that competition is affected by government policies with respect to fuel and other taxes  highway tolls and permissible truck sizes and weights 
to a lesser degree  we also face competition with similar products made in other areas  a kind of competition commonly known as geographic competition 
for example  a paper producer may choose to increase or decrease production at a specific plant served by one of our railroads depending on the relative competitiveness of that plant versus paper plants in other locations 
in some instances  we face product competition  where commodities we transport are exposed to competition from substitutes 

table of contents in acquiring rail properties  we generally compete with other short line and regional railroad operators and with various financial institutions  including private equity firms  operating in conjunction with short line rail operators 
competition for rail properties is based primarily upon price and the seller s assessment of the buyer s railroad operating expertise and financing capability 
we believe our established reputation as a successful acquirer and operator of short line rail properties  combined with our managerial and financial resources  effectively positions us to take advantage of acquisition opportunities 
regulation united states in addition to environmental laws  securities laws  state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to many businesses  our united states railroads are subject to regulation by the surface transportation board stb  the federal railroad administration fra  federal agencies  including the united states department of transportation dot  occupational safety and health administration osha and transportation security administration tsa  which operates under the department of homeland security dhs  state departments of transportation  and some state and local regulatory agencies 
the stb is the successor to certain regulatory functions previously administered by the interstate commerce commission icc 
established by the icc termination act of  the stb has jurisdiction over  among other things  certain freight rates where there is no effective competition  extension or abandonment of rail lines  the acquisition of rail lines and consolidation  merger or acquisition of control of rail common carriers 
in limited circumstances  the stb may condition its approval of an acquisition upon the acquirer of a railroad agreeing to provide severance benefits to certain subsequently terminated employees 
the fra  dot and osha have jurisdiction over safety  which includes the regulation of equipment standards  track maintenance  handling of hazardous shipments  locomotive and rail car inspection  repair requirements  operating practices and crew qualifications 
the tsa has broad authority over railroad operating practices that have implications for homeland security 
in some cases  state and local laws and regulations may regulate certain aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in areas not otherwise regulated by federal law 
on january   the fra issued final rules governing installation of positive train control ptc by the end of although still under development  ptc is a collision avoidance technology intended to override locomotive controls and stop a train before an accident 
certain of our railroads may be required to install ptc or ptc related equipment by the end of we do not expect that our compliance with the final rules governing the installation of ptc will give rise to any significant financial expenditures 
in addition  in the stb initiated several proceedings that explore the regulation of railroad operations and competition in the railroad industry 
congressional initiatives focused on the same topics are also underway 
we are closely monitoring these proceedings and legislation 
the outcome of these initiatives could impact regulation of railroad operations and prices for our rail services  which could undermine the economic viability of certain of our railroads  as well as threaten the service we are able to provide to our customers 
the failure to comply with governmental regulations or changes to the legislative and regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 

table of contents canada st 
lawrence atlantic railroad quebec is a federally regulated railroad and falls under the jurisdiction of the canada transportation agency cta and transport canada tc and is subject to the railway safety act 
the cta regulates construction and operation of federally regulated railways  financial transactions of federally regulated railway companies  all aspects of rates  tariffs and services and the transferring and discontinuing of the operation of railway lines 
tc administers the railway safety act  which ensures that federally regulated railway companies abide by all regulations with respect to engineering standards governing the construction or alteration of railway works and the operation and maintenance standards of railway works and equipment 
quebec gatineau railway inc and huron central railway inc 
are subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial governments of quebec and ontario  respectively 
provincially regulated railways operate only within one province and hold a certificate of fitness delivered by a provincial authority 
in the province of quebec  the fitness certificate is delivered by the minist re des transports du quebec  while in ontario  under the shortline railways act   a license must be obtained from the registrar of shortline railways 
construction  operation and discontinuance of operation are regulated  as are railway services 
acquisitions of additional railroad operations in canada  whether federally or provincially regulated  may be subject to review under the investment canada act ica  a federal statute that applies to the acquisition of a canadian business or establishment of a new canadian business by a non canadian 
in the case of an acquisition that is subject to review  a non canadian investor must observe a statutory waiting period prior to completion and satisfy the minister responsible for the administration of the ica that the investment will be of net benefit to canada  considering certain evaluative factors set out in the legislation 
any contemplated acquisitions may also be subject to canada s competition act  which contains provisions relating to pre merger notification as well as substantive merger provisions 
australia in australia  regulation of rail safety is generally governed by state legislation and administered by state regulatory agencies 
our australian assets are subject to the regulatory regimes governing safety in each of the states and the one territory in which we operate 
regulation of track access is governed by overriding federal legislation with state based regimes operating in compliance with the federal legislation 
as a result  with respect to rail infrastructure access  our australian subsidiaries are also subject to state based access regimes and federal laws related to access and competition  including part iiia of the trade practices act in addition  any new acquisitions in australia will also be subject to review by the foreign investment review board and the australian competition and consumer commission 
netherlands in the netherlands  we are subject to regulation by the ministry of transport  public works and water management  the transport  public works and water management inspectorate  the dutch railways manager  prorail  and keyrail  the dutch railways manager for the betuweroute  a high speed freight railway connecting the port of rotterdam to the german border  and within the port of rotterdam 
in addition  at the european level  several directives have been issued concerning the transportation of goods by railway 
these directives generally cover the development of the railways  allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and the licensing of railway undertakings 
the european union eu legislation also sets a framework for a harmonized approach to railway safety 
every railway company must obtain a safety certification before it can run trains on the european network and eu member states must set up national railway safety authorities and independent accident investigation bodies 
these directives have been implemented in dutch railway legislation such as the railways act 

table of contents the dutch competition authority dca is charged with the supervision of compliance with the european community s directives on the development of the railways  the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure 
environmental matters our operations are subject to various federal  state  provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
in the united states  these environmental laws and regulations  which are implemented principally by the environmental protection agency and comparable state agencies  govern the management of hazardous wastes  the discharge of pollutants into the air and into surface and underground waters and the manufacture and disposal of certain substances 
the primary laws affecting our operations are the resource conservation and recovery act  regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes  the clean air act  regulating air emissions and the clean water act  regulating water discharges 
in canada  environmental laws and regulations are administered at the federal level by environment canada and the ministry of transport and comparable agencies at the provincial level 
in australia  these functions are administered primarily by the department of transport at the federal level and by environmental protection agencies at the state level 
in the netherlands  national laws regulating the protection of the environment are administered by the ministry of housing  spatial planning and the environment and authorities at the provincial and municipal level  while laws regulating the transportation of hazardous substances are primarily administered by the ministry of transport  public works and water management 
the commonwealth of australia has acknowledged that certain portions of the leasehold and freehold land acquired from them and used by our australian operations contain contamination arising from activities associated with previous operators 
the commonwealth has carried out certain remediation work to meet existing south australia environmental standards 
noncompliance with applicable legal provisions may result in the imposition of fines  temporary or permanent shutdown of operations or other injunctive relief  criminal prosecution or the termination of our concession in australia 
we believe that the facilities which we operate are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws  regulation and agency agreements 
there are no material environmental claims currently pending or  to our knowledge  threatened against us or any of our railroads 
in addition  we believe our railroads operate in material compliance with current environmental laws and regulations 
we estimate any expenses incurred in maintaining compliance with current environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or capital expenditures 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that unidentified environmental matters or the adoption of additional or more stringent environmental laws and regulations would have on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
discontinued operations in august of  we completed the sale of of the share of capital of ferrocarriles chiapas mayab  sa de sa fccm  our mexican operating subsidiary  to viablis  sa de sa viablis 
the net assets  results of operations and cash flows on our remaining mexican subsidiary  gw servicios sa servicios  which were classified as discontinued operations  were not material as of and for the year ended december  we do not expect any material adverse financial impact from servicios 
results of our mexican operations are included in results from discontinued operations

risk factors 
our operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks that could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed or forecast in our forward looking statements  including the risks described below and the risks that may be identified in future documents that are filed or furnished with the sec 
general risks associated with our business adverse global macroeconomic and business conditions could negatively impact our business 
the global economy  which experienced a significant downturn starting in late  including widespread recessionary conditions  high levels of unemployment  significant distress of global financial institutions  extreme volatility in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others  began to improve in however  while some economic indicators trended positively  the overall rate of global recovery experienced during has been uneven and uncertainty remains over the stability of the recovery 
there can be no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be broad based and sustainable  or that they will enhance conditions in markets relevant to us 
in addition  it is difficult to determine how the general macroeconomic and business conditions will impact our customers  our suppliers and our business in general 
we are required to assess for potential impairment of non current assets whenever events or changes in circumstances  including economic circumstances  indicate that the respective asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
given the asset intensive nature of our business  weakness in the general economy increases the risk of significant asset impairment charges 
worsening of current macroeconomic and financial conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
if we are unable to consummate additional acquisitions or investments  then we may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully 
our growth strategy is based to a large extent on the selective acquisition and development of  and investment in  rail operations  both in new regions and in regions in which we currently operate 
the success of this strategy will depend on  among other things the availability of suitable opportunities  the level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources  our ability to value acquisition and investment opportunities accurately and negotiate acceptable terms for those acquisitions and investments  our ability to identify and enter into mutually beneficial relationships with partners  and the availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the new businesses effectively 
we may need additional capital to fund our acquisitions and investments 
if we are unable to obtain this capital at a reasonable cost  then we may forego potential opportunities  which would impair the execution of our growth strategy 
since january   we have acquired interests in railroads  all of which were purchased for cash 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of undrawn revolver capacity available for acquisitions or other activities  subject to maintaining compliance with the covenants under our credit agreement 
we intend to continue to review acquisition and investment opportunities 
table of contents and potential purchases of railroad assets and to attempt to acquire companies and assets that meet our investment criteria 
as in the past  we expect that we will pay cash for some or all of the purchase price of acquisitions and purchases that we make 
in addition  from time to time we may make investments in equipment and assets to support our customers 
depending on the number of acquisitions and investments and funding requirements  we may need to raise substantial additional capital 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities  the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions and costs on our operations 
additional capital  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may forego potential acquisitions  which could impair the execution of our growth strategy 
our inability to acquire or integrate acquired businesses successfully or to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits could have adverse consequences to our business 
we may not be able to acquire or integrate acquired companies or businesses successfully 
evaluating acquisition targets gives rise to additional costs related to legal  financial  operating and industry due diligence 
in addition  acquisitions generally result in increased operating and administrative costs and  to the extent financed with debt  additional interest costs 
integrating acquired businesses could also result in significant restructuring costs 
the process of acquiring businesses may be disruptive to our existing business and may cause an interruption or reduction of our business as a result of the following factors  among others loss of key employees or customers  possible inconsistencies in or conflicts between standards  controls  procedures and policies among the combined companies and the need to implement company wide financial  accounting  information technology and other systems  failure to maintain the quality of services that have historically been provided  integrating employees of rail lines acquired from other entities into our regional railroad culture  failure to coordinate geographically diverse organizations  and the diversion of management s attention from our day to day business as a result of the need to manage any disruptions and difficulties and the need to add management resources to do so 
these disruptions and difficulties  if they occur  may cause us to fail to realize the cost savings  revenue enhancements and other benefits that we expect to result from integrating acquired companies and may cause material adverse short and long term effects on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
even if we are able to integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations  we may not realize the full benefits of the cost savings  revenue enhancements or other benefits that we may have expected at the time of acquisition 
the expected revenue enhancements and cost savings are based on extensive analyses 
these analyses necessarily involve assumptions as to future events  including general business and industry conditions  the longevity of specific customer plants and factories served  operating costs and competitive factors  most of which are beyond our control and may not materialize 
while we believe these analyses and their underlying assumptions to be reasonable  they are estimates that are necessarily speculative in nature 
in addition  even if we achieve the expected benefits  we may not be able to achieve them within the anticipated time frame 
also  the cost savings and other synergies from these acquisitions may be offset by unexpected costs incurred in integrating the companies  increases in other expenses or problems in the business unrelated to these acquisitions 
finally  the physical conditions of the assets acquired may not be sufficient to support the operations 
many of our recent acquisitions have involved the purchase of stock of existing companies 
these acquisitions  as well as acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of a company  may expose us to liability for actions taken by an acquired business and its management before our acquisition 
the due diligence we conduct 
table of contents in connection with an acquisition and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies may not be sufficient to protect us from  or compensate us for  actual liabilities 
generally  the representations made by the sellers  other than certain representations related to fundamental matters  such as ownership of capital stock  expire within several years of the closing 
a material liability associated with an acquisition  especially where there is no right to indemnification  could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
our results of operations and rail structure are susceptible to severe weather conditions and other natural occurrences 
we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions  including floods  fires  hurricanes  droughts  earthquakes and other natural occurrences 
for example  bad weather and natural disasters  such as blizzards in the northeastern united states and canada and hurricanes or cyclones in the southeastern united states and australia  could cause a shutdown or substantial disruption of operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
even if a material adverse weather or other condition does not directly affect our operations  it can impact the operations of our customers or connecting carriers 
in addition our minerals and stone revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the northeastern united states  which lessen demand for road salt 
our coal and coke revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the midwestern united states  which lessen demand for coal 
our revenues generated by our australian operations are susceptible to the impact of drought conditions on the south australian grain harvest and the impact of heavy rains and flooding in the northern territory 
furthermore  our expenses could be adversely impacted by such weather conditions  including  for example  higher track maintenance and overtime costs in the winter at our railroads in the northeastern united states and canada related to snow removal and mandated work breaks 
such weather conditions could also cause our customers or connecting carriers to reduce or suspend their operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we are subject to significant governmental regulation of our railroad operations 
the failure to comply with governmental regulations or changes to the legislative and regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we are subject to governmental regulation with respect to our railroad operations and to a variety of health  safety  security  labor  environmental and other matters by a significant number of federal  state and local regulatory authorities 
in the united states  these agencies include the stb  dot  fra of the dot  osha  dhs and other federal agencies and state departments of transportation 
in australia  we are subject to both commonwealth and state regulations 
in canada  we are subject to regulation by the cta  tc and the regulatory departments of the provincial governments of quebec and ontario 
in the netherlands  we are subject to regulation by the ministry of transport  public works and water management  the transport  public works and water management inspectorate and dutch railways managers  prorail and keyrail 
see part i 
item business regulation for a discussion of these regulations 
our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
there are various legislative and regulatory actions being considered in the united states  including legislation proposed in the senate in january that would modify the regulatory oversight of the rail industry and various proceedings that have been initiated by the stb related to rail competition 
the majority of the actions under consideration and pending are directed at class i railroads  however  specific initiatives being considered by congress and the stb could expand regulation of railroad operations and prices for our rail 
table of contents services  which could undermine the economic viability of certain of our railroads  as well as threaten the service we are able to provide to our customers 
the cost of compliance with the proposed rules and regulations could also be significant 
federal  state and local regulatory authorities may change the regulatory framework without providing us with any recourse for the adverse effects that the changes may have on our business  including  without limitation  regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution and business relationships with our customers and other railroads 
as a result  changes to legislation and the regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
our credit agreement and note purchase agreements contain numerous covenants that impose certain restrictions on the way we operate our business 
our credit agreement contains numerous covenants that impose restrictions on our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  create liens on our assets  make certain types of investments  repurchase shares or pay dividends  make expenditures for capital projects  merge or consolidate with others  make asset acquisitions other than in the ordinary course of business  dispose of assets or use asset sale proceeds  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
our credit agreement also contains financial covenants that require us to meet a number of financial ratios and tests 
our failure to comply with the obligations in our credit agreement could result in an increase in our interest expense and could give rise to events of default under the credit agreement  which  if not cured or waived  could permit lenders to accelerate our indebtedness 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties  and their failure to meet their financial obligations could adversely affect our business 
our business is subject to credit risk 
there is a risk that customers or counterparties  which include government entities related to grants and financial institutions related to derivative transactions  will fail to meet their obligations when due 
customers and counterparties that owe us money have defaulted and may continue to default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failure or other reasons 
we have procedures for reviewing our receivables and credit exposures to specific customers and counterparties  however  default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee 
certain of our risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets  customers or other matters 
this information may not  in all cases  be accurate  complete  up to date or properly evaluated 
as a result  unexpected credit exposures could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the loss of important customers or contracts may adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
our operations served more than freight customers in freight revenues from our largest freight customers accounted for approximately of our total revenues in in  our largest freight customer was a company in the farm and food products industry  total revenues from which accounted for approximately 
table of contents of our total revenues 
we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us  our connecting carriers and the customer 
these contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration 
these contracts establish price or  in the case of longer term contracts  a methodology for determining price  but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume 
freight rates and volumes are not directly linked to the prices of the commodities being shipped 
substantial reduction in business with or loss of important customers or contracts could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
because we depend on class i railroads and other connecting carriers for a majority of our operations  our operating results  financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if our relationships with these carriers deteriorate 
the railroad industry in the united states and canada is dominated by seven class i carriers that have substantial market control and negotiating leverage 
in  approximately of our total carloads in the united states and canada were interchanged with class i carriers 
a decision by any of these class i carriers to cease certain freight movements could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the quantitative impact of such a decision would depend on which of our routes and freight movements were affected 
in addition  class i carriers also have traditionally been significant sources of business for us  as well as sources of potential acquisition candidates as they divest branch lines to smaller rail operators 
our ability to provide rail service to customers in the united states and canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to freight rates  revenue divisions  fuel surcharges  car supply  reciprocal switching  interchange and trackage rights 
deterioration in the operations of or service provided by those connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we are dependent on lease agreements with class i railroads and other third parties for our operations  strategy and growth 
our rail operations are dependent  in part  on lease agreements with class i railroads and third parties that allow us to operate over certain segments of track critical to our operations 
for instance  we lease several railroads from class i carriers under long term lease arrangements  which collectively accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
in addition  we own several railroads that also lease portions of the track or right of way upon which they operate from class i railroads and other third parties 
our ability to provide comprehensive rail services to our customers on the leased lines depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and extend these lease agreements 
expiration or termination of these leases or failure of our railroads to comply with the terms of these leases could result in the loss of operating rights with respect to those rail properties 
we face competition from numerous sources  including those relating to geography  substitute products  other types of transportation and other rail operators 
each of our railroads is typically the only rail carrier directly serving our customers 
however  in certain circumstances  including under the open access regimes in australia and the netherlands  our customers have direct access to other rail carriers 
in addition  our railroads also compete directly with other modes of transportation  principally motor carriers and  on some routes  ship  barge and pipeline operators 
transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rights of way that are built and maintained by governmental entities  while we must build and maintain our network 
in addition  competition for our services could increase if other rail operators build new rail lines to access certain of our customers or if legislation is passed that provides materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight restrictions 

table of contents we are also subject to geographic and product competition 
for example  a customer could shift production to a region where we do not have operations or could substitute one commodity for another commodity that is not transported by rail 
in either case  we could lose a source of revenues 
the extent of this competition varies significantly among our railroads 
competition is based primarily upon the rate charged  the relative costs of substitutable products and the transit time required 
in addition  competition is based on the quality and reliability of the service provided 
because a significant portion of our carloads in the united states and canada involve interchange with another carrier  we have only limited control over the total price  transit time or quality of such service 
however  changes to the competitive landscape could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
for information on the competition associated with the open access regimes in australia and europe  see additional risks associated with our foreign operations 
it is difficult to quantify the potential impact of competition on our business  since not only each customer  but also each customer location and each product shipped from such location is subject to different types of competition 
market and regulatory responses to climate change could adversely affect our operating costs and decrease demand for the commodities we transport 
clean air laws  restrictions  caps  taxes  or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases  including diesel exhaust  could significantly increase our operating costs 
restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that use commodities that we carry to produce energy  use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry  or manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels  including coal fired power plants  chemical producers  farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers 
significant cost increases  government regulation  or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns  including  for example  the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers 
any of these factors  individually or in conjunction with one or more of the other factors  or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle 
we could incur significant costs for violations of  or liabilities under  environmental laws and regulations 
our railroad operations and real estate ownership are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  emissions to the air  discharges to waters  the handling  storage  transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases 
we may incur environmental liability from conditions or practices at properties previously owned or operated by us  properties leased by us and other properties owned by third parties for example  properties at which hazardous substances or wastes for which we are responsible have been treated  stored  spilled or disposed  as well as at properties currently owned by us 
under some environmental statutes  such liability may be found without regard to whether we were at fault and may also be joint and several  whereby we are responsible for all the liability at issue even though we or the entity that gives rise to our liability may be only one of a number of entities whose conduct contributed to the liability 
environmental liabilities may arise from claims asserted by owners or occupants of affected properties  other third parties affected by environmental conditions for example  contractors and current or former employees seeking to recover in connection with alleged damages to their property or personal injury or death  and or by governmental authorities seeking to remedy environmental conditions or to enforce environmental 
table of contents obligations 
environmental requirements and liabilities could obligate us to incur significant costs  including significant expenses to investigate and remediate environmental contamination  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
exposure to market risks  particularly changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  and hedging transactions entered into to mitigate such risks could adversely impact our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we are exposed to various market risks  including interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
it is impossible to fully mitigate all such exposure and higher interest rates and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
from time to time  we may use various financial instruments to reduce our exposure to certain market risks 
while these financial instruments reduce the company s exposure to market risks  the use of such instruments may ultimately limit the company s ability to benefit from lower interest rates or favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to amounts fixed at the time of entering into the hedge agreement  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we may be adversely affected by diesel fuel supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets and increases in diesel fuel costs 
we consumed million gallons of diesel fuel in fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations 
if a severe fuel supply shortage arose from production curtailments  disruption of oil imports  disruption of domestic refinery production  damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure  political unrest  war or otherwise  diesel fuel may not be readily available and may be subject to rationing regulations 
in addition  diesel fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses and an increase in diesel fuel costs could have a negative effect on our profitability 
although we receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments to offset rising fuel prices  if class i railroads change their policies regarding fuel surcharges  the compensation we receive for increases in fuel costs may decrease 
costs for fuel used in operations were approximately and of our operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
if diesel fuel prices increase dramatically from production curtailments  a disruption of oil imports or otherwise  these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
as a common carrier by rail  we are required to transport hazardous materials  regardless of risk 
transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury  property damage and environmental remediation costs and compromise critical parts of our railroads 
in addition  insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or certain coverage may not be available to us in the future if there is a catastrophic event related to rail transportation of these commodities 
in addition  federal regulators have previously prescribed regulations governing railroads transportation of hazardous materials and have the ability to put in place additional regulations 
for instance  recently enacted legislation requires pre notification for hazardous materials shipments 
such legislation and regulations could impose significant additional costs on railroads 
additionally  regulations adopted by the dot and the dhs could significantly increase the costs associated with moving hazardous materials on our railroads 
further  certain local governments have sought to enact ordinances banning hazardous materials moving by rail within their borders 
such ordinances could require the re routing of hazardous materials shipments  with the potential for significant additional costs 
increases in costs associated with the transportation of hazardous materials could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 

table of contents the occurrence of losses or other liabilities that are either not covered by insurance or that exceed our insurance limits could materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we have obtained for each of our railroads insurance coverage for losses arising from personal injury and for property damage in the event of derailments or other accidents or occurrences 
on certain of the rail lines over which we operate  freight trains are commingled with passenger trains 
for instance  in oregon we operate certain passenger trains for the tri county metropolitan transportation district of oregon over our portland western railroad 
unexpected or catastrophic circumstances such as accidents involving passenger trains or spillage of hazardous materials could cause our liability to exceed expected statutory limits  third party insurance limits and our insurance limits 
also  insurance is available from only a very limited number of insurers  and we may not be able to obtain insurance protection at our current levels or obtain it on terms acceptable to us 
in addition  subsequent adverse events directly and indirectly attributable to us may result in additional increases in our insurance premiums and or our self insured retentions and could result in limitations to the coverage under our existing policies 
unless it is extended  the expiration of the short line tax credit on december   will increase our effective tax rate 
since  we have benefited from the effects of the short line tax credit  which is an income tax credit for class ii and class iii railroads to reduce their federal income tax based on qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures the short line tax credit 
qualified expenditures include amounts incurred for maintaining track  including roadbed  bridges and related track structures owned or leased by a class ii or class iii railroad 
the credit is equal to of the qualified expenditures  subject to an annual limitation of  multiplied by the number of miles of railroad track owned or leased by the class ii or class iii railroad as of the end of their tax year 
in and  the short line tax credit lowered our effective tax rate by and  respectively 
the most recent extension of the short line tax credit only extends the credit through december  if the short line tax credit is not extended for additional tax years  the loss of the credit will increase our effective tax rate and reduce our reported earnings per share 
certain of our capital projects may be impacted by our ability to obtain government funding 
certain of our existing capital projects are  and certain of our future capital projects may be partially or completely funded through government grant programs 
during  we obtained government funding for separate projects that were partially funded by united states and canadian federal  state and municipal agencies 
the spending associated with these grant funded projects represented approximately of our total capital expenditures during government funding for projects is limited  and there is no guarantee that budget pressure at the federal  state and local level or changing governmental priorities will not eliminate funding availability 
in addition  competition for government funding from other short line railroads  class i railroads and other companies is significant  and the receipt of government funds is often contingent on the acceptance of contractual obligations that may not be strictly profit maximizing 
in certain jurisdictions  the acceptance of government funds may impose additional legal obligations on our operations  such as compliance with prevailing wage requirements 
if we are unable to obtain adequate government funding  we may have to defer or forgo such capital projects 
some of our employees belong to labor unions  and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the united states  australia and canada 
in north america  we are party to contracts with national labor organizations 
we are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to of those agreements 
we have also entered into employee association agreements with an additional employees who are not represented by a national labor organization 
gwa has a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of its employees 
our inability to negotiate 
table of contents acceptable contracts with these unions could result in  among other things  strikes  work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers 
if the unionized workers were to engage in a strike  work stoppage or other slowdown  or other employees were to become unionized  or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and or higher ongoing labor costs 
to date  we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages 
we are also subject to the risk of the unionization of our non unionized employees 
additional unionization of our workforce could result in higher employee compensation and restrictive working condition demands that could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility 
if we are unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled workers  our operating results  financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected 
we believe that our success and our growth depend upon our ability to attract and retain skilled workers who possess the ability to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities 
the operation and maintenance of our equipment and facilities involve complex and specialized processes and often must be performed in harsh conditions  resulting in a high employee turnover rate when compared to many other industries 
the challenge of attracting and retaining the necessary workforce is increased by the expected retirement of an aging workforce and significant competition for specialized trades 
within the next five years  we estimate that approximately of the current workforce will become eligible for retirement 
many of these workers hold key operating positions  such as conductors  engineers and mechanics 
in addition  the demand for workers with the types of skills we require has increased  especially from class i railroads  which can usually offer higher wages and better benefits 
a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force or an increase in the wage rates that we must pay or both 
if any of these events were to occur  our cost structure could increase  our profit margins could decrease and our growth strategy could be impaired 
our operations are dependent on our ability to obtain rail cars  locomotives and other critical railroad items from suppliers 
due to the capital intensive nature and industry specific requirements of the rail industry  there are high barriers of entry for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as rail cars  locomotives and track materials 
if the number of available rail cars is insufficient or if the cost of obtaining these rail cars either through lease or purchase increases  we might not be able to obtain rail cars on favorable terms  or at all  and shippers may seek alternate forms of transportation 
as of january   according to the aar  approximately of the north american railcar fleet was in storage 
in some cases we use third party locomotives to provide transportation services to our customers and locomotives may not be available 
without these third party locomotives  we would need to invest additional capital in locomotives 
even if purchased  there is no guarantee that locomotives would be available for delivery without significant delay 
additionally  we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of certain track materials  such as rail and ties 
changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited supplier markets could result in equipment shortages that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity in a particular year or quarter 
we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 
the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment  personal injury  freight loss  property damage and other matters 
for example  united states job related personal injury claims by our railroad employees are subject to fela  which is applicable only to railroads 
fela s fault based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no fault worker s compensation system 
the variability inherent in this system could result in the actual costs of claims being very different from the liability recorded 

table of contents any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving material freight loss or property damage  personal injury and environmental liability that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we may be affected by acts of terrorism or anti terrorism measures 
our rail lines  port operations and other facilities and equipment  including rail cars carrying hazardous materials that we are required to transport under federal law as a common carrier  could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks 
any terrorist attack or other similar event could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  regulatory measures designed to control terrorism could impose substantial costs upon us and could result in impairment to our service  which could also have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
additional risks associated with our foreign operations we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 
some of our significant subsidiaries transact business in foreign countries  namely in australia  canada and the netherlands 
in addition  we may consider acquisitions or other investments in other foreign countries in the future 
the risks of doing business in foreign countries include adverse changes or greater volatility in the economies of those countries  adverse currency movements that make goods produced in those countries that are destined for export markets less competitive  adverse changes to the regulatory environment or access regimes of those countries  adverse changes to the tax laws and regulations of those countries  restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment  or a decrease in the value of repatriated cash flows  a decrease in the value of foreign sourced income as a result of exchange rate changes  the actual or perceived failure by us to fulfill commitments under concession agreements  the ability to identify and retain qualified local managers  and the challenge of managing a culturally and geographically diverse operation 
because some of our significant subsidiaries and affiliates transact business in foreign currencies and because a significant portion of our net income comes from the operations of our foreign subsidiaries  exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect us and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods 
our operations in australia  canada and the netherlands accounted for  and of our consolidated operating revenues  respectively  for the year ended december  our operations in australia  canada and the netherlands accounted for  and of our long lived assets  respectively  as of december  the results of operations of our foreign entities are maintained in the local currency the australian dollar  the canadian dollar and the euro and then translated into united states dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the united states dollar can impact our results of 
table of contents operations 
the financial statements of the company s foreign subsidiaries are prepared in the local currency of the respective subsidiary and translated into united states dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the period for balance sheet items and  for the statement of operations  at the average rate for the statement period 
the exchange rates between these currencies and the united states dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future 
we may not be able to manage our exchange rate risks effectively  and the volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  because our financial statements are stated in united states dollars  such fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods 
our concession and or lease agreements in australia could be cancelled  and there is no guarantee these agreements will be extended beyond their terms 
through our subsidiaries in australia  we have entered into long term concession and or lease agreements with governmental authorities in the northern territory and south australia 
our concession agreement for the tarcoola to darwin rail line expires in and our lease agreement for our south australia rail lines expires in these concession and lease agreements are subject to a number of conditions  including those relating to the maintenance of certain standards with respect to service  price and the environment 
these concession and lease agreements also typically carry with them a commitment to maintain the condition of the railroad and to make a certain level of capital expenditures  which may require capital expenditures that are in excess of our projections 
our failure to meet these commitments under the long term concession and lease agreements could result in the termination of those concession or lease agreements 
the termination of any concession or lease agreement could result in the loss of our entire investment relating to that concession or lease agreement 
further  the expiration of these agreements and the end of their term would result in the loss of the associated revenues and income 
either of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
open access regimes in australia and the netherlands could lead to additional competition for rail services and decreased revenues and profit margins 
the legislative and regulatory framework in australia allows third party rail operators to gain access to our australian railway infrastructure and also governs our access to track owned by others 
the netherlands also has an open access regime that permits third party rail operators to compete for rrf s business 
there are limited barriers to entry to preclude a current or prospective rail operator from approaching our customers and seeking to capture their business 
the loss of our customers to competitors could result in decreased revenues and profit margins  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
changes to the open access regimes in australia and the netherlands could have a significant impact on our operations 
access fees paid for our access onto the track of other companies and access fees we charge under state and federal regimes are subject to change 
where we pay access fees to others  if those fees were increased  our operating margins could be negatively affected 
in australia  if the federal government or respective state regulators were to alter the regulatory regime or determine that access fees charged to current or prospective third party rail freight operators by our australian railroads did not meet competitive standards  our income from those fees could decline 
in addition  when we operate over track networks owned by others  the owners of the networks are responsible for scheduling the use of the tracks as well as for determining the amount and timing of the expenditures necessary to maintain the tracks in satisfactory condition 
therefore  in areas where we operate over tracks owned by others  our operations are subject to train scheduling set by the owners as well as the risk that the network will not be adequately maintained 

table of contents revocation of our safety accreditations could result in a loss of revenue and termination of our concession 
our operating subsidiaries in australia and the netherlands hold safety accreditations that are required to provide freight rail services 
continued maintenance of our safety accreditation in australia is a requirement under our concession deeds 
these safety accreditations are essential for us to conduct our business and are subject to removal and expiration 
any loss of  failure to maintain or inability to renew  rail safety accreditations necessary to carry on rail operations in any jurisdiction  or any changes in government policy and legal or regulatory oversight  including changes to the rail safety regulatory regime  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operational performance and financial results 
changes to the mining tax regime in australia could have a negative impact on our existing customers and the prospects for new customer initiatives underway 
on may   the australian government announced its intention to introduce a resource super profits tax rspt 
on july   the australian government announced that it proposes to replace the rspt with a new minerals resource rent tax mrrt 
the mrrt would apply to australian entities iron ore and coal projects after july in the event that such a tax is implemented  this could result in an increase in operating costs for mining assets based in australia 
this may render certain existing and proposed projects not economically viable and result in mining companies choosing to cancel projects currently planned to meet growing demand  as well as reducing the level of investment in the australian resources sector 
any of these changes could have an adverse effect on our australian operations by reducing the volume of commodities mined in australia for us to transport  as well as by reducing levels of demand for australian commodities and our transportation of those commodities 
consequently  the introduction of the mrrt could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
australia recognizes a form of native title that reflects the entitlement of indigenous inhabitants to their traditional lands  which could impact our gwa north operations 
there are a number of native title claims registered with the national native title tribunal that could give rise to native title rights on discrete parcels of land over which we operate 
while no native title claims have been made against lots associated with our business to date  there is a risk that a claim could be made that native title exists 
a successful claim could prevent or limit our use of the land or require us to make payments  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
gwa is subject to several contractual restrictions on its ability to compete 
as a result of our june sale of the western australia operations and certain other assets of the australian railroad group pty ltd and its subsidiaries arg to queensland rail and babcock brown limited arg sale  gwa is subject to a a five year non compete expiring june in the state of western australia  the melbourne to adelaide corridor and certain areas within the state of new south wales historically served by arg  b a right of first refusal for the benefit of queensland rail with respect to the sale of i gwa or a majority of the ownership of gwa and ii a number of high horsepower locomotives and intermodal wagons owned or operated by gwa and c a five year restriction expiring in june on hiring of arg employees who remain employed by arg after the sale 
these contractual restrictions may place limits on our ability to grow gwa s business or divest of certain assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity

table of contents on december   we acquired certain assets of freightlink 
in  we incurred million of acquisition related expenses charged to earnings related to this transaction 
in addition  we reversed million of accrued restructuring expense related to our huron central railway inc hcry 
in  we acquired the remaining interest in maryland midland railway  inc in addition  we recorded a non cash write down of non current assets of million and million of restructuring expense  which were partially offset by a tax benefit of million related to hcry 
in  we acquired of the equity interests in summit view  inc  the parent company of short line railroads known as the ohio central railway system ocr with net assets of million  cagy industries  inc  the parent company of three short line railroads  with net assets of million  rotterdam rail feeding bv in the netherlands with net assets of million  and georgia southwestern railroad  inc with net assets of million 
in  we acquired of maryland midland railway  inc with net assets of million 
also in  we ceased our mexican rail operations and initiated formal liquidation proceedings of fccm  our wholly owned mexican subsidiary 
as a result of our formal notification to the secretaria de communicaciones y transportes sct of our intent to exercise our right to resign our mexican operations  the sct seized substantially all of our mexican operating assets 
as a result of these and other actions  we recorded a million loss from discontinued operations in  partially offset by a united states tax benefit of million  primarily related to a worthless stock and bad debt deductions to be claimed in the united states 
in  gwi and our former partner in the australian railroad group pty ltd and its subsidiaries arg  wesfarmers limited wesfarmers  completed the sale of the western australia operations and certain other assets of arg to queensland rail and babcock brown limited arg sale 
as a result of the arg sale  we recognized a million net gain  including a million gain from the cumulative translation of the foreign currency investment and related equity earnings in arg into united states dollars since in connection with the arg sale  the company also incurred million of net transaction related expenses  of which million related to management bonuses and stock option awards 
simultaneous with the arg sale  we purchased wesfarmers ownership of the remaining arg operations for million gwa purchase 
since gwi previously held a share of these assets through its ownership interest in arg  it applied a step method to the allocation of value among the assets and liabilities of gwa 
because the million purchase price for wesfarmers share was lower than of the book value arg had historically recorded on these assets  we recorded a non cash loss of million million  net of tax  representing our share of the impairment loss recorded by arg  which was included in equity income of unconsolidated international affiliates in the consolidated statement of operations in accordingly  we included of the value of gwa s net assets million in our consolidated balance sheet since june  in addition  in we determined that our indirect investments in bolivia had suffered an other than temporary decline in value as a result of the heightened political and economic unrest and uncertainties in that country and we wrote down million of the investment with a corresponding charge to earnings 
discontinued operations included a non cash charge of million million  net of tax reflecting the write down of non current assets and related costs associated with fccm 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
our consolidated financial statements were determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
outlook for north american and european economic activity improved late in the first quarter of and then stabilized for the rest of the year 
we expect the north american and european economies to remain stable in we expect the south australia and northern territory economies to remain strong in  benefitting from continued strength in the natural resources sector 
we expect that the largest single impact on financial results for gwi will be the full year impact of the freightlink acquisition that closed on december  in addition to the impact of the freightlink acquisition  we expect same railroad revenues to increase in primarily due to two factors 
first  we expect same railroad revenues to increase from additional carloads and overall higher average revenues per carload 
second  the appreciation of the australian and canadian dollars and the euro versus the united states dollar are currently at levels higher than the average exchange rates experienced in if sustained  the translation impact of the change in exchange rates will increase our reported revenues in in  we expect same railroad carload volumes to be higher than across nearly all commodity groups 
we expect the most significant increases in the metals  other commodities and farm and food products groups 
metals traffic is expected to increase due to inclusion of carloads from the huron central railway inc hcry and a significant customer plant expansion 
on january   hcry started operating under a new agreement with certain customers and gwi has resumed reporting carloads for hcry 
other commodities are expected to increase due to higher haulage traffic and increases in municipal solid waste traffic 
farm and food traffic is expected to increase  primarily due to a larger australian grain harvest in that is expected to ship in we expect same railroad average revenues per carload to increase due to increases in north american rail pricing  the appreciation of the australian and canadian dollars versus the united states dollar and increases in fuel surcharges as a result of higher fuel prices 
we expect same railroad non freight revenues to increase in primarily due to the appreciation of the australian and canadian dollars versus the united states dollar  which  if sustained  will result in higher industrial and port terminal switching revenues and stronger third party fuel sales volumes 
we expect same railroad demurrage and storage income to decline  primarily due to fewer third party cars stored on our railroads 
same railroad operating expenses are expected to increase in primarily due to four factors 
first  we expect an increase in transportation expenses and diesel fuel consumption due to the increase in carloads 
second  diesel fuel prices are currently much higher than the average prices experienced in if diesel fuel prices remain at current levels we expect that diesel fuel expense will be significantly higher in than in  from both higher fuel prices and also higher levels of fuel consumption 
third  we expect higher depreciation expense in due to the higher levels of our capital spending in recent years 
fourth  we expect higher operating expenses as a result of the appreciation of the australian and canadian dollars and the euro versus the united states dollar 
we expect that the full year contribution of the freightlink acquisition and higher revenues due to volume and rate increases at our existing operations will offset expected higher costs for transportation  fuel and depreciation resulting in an improvement in our operating ratio 

table of contents overview we own and operate short line and regional freight railroads and provide railcar switching services in the united states  australia  canada and the netherlands 
in addition  we operate the tarcoola to darwin rail line  which links the port of darwin to the australian interstate rail network in south australia 
operations currently include railroads organized in nine regions  with approximately  miles of owned and leased track and approximately  additional miles under track access arrangements 
in addition  we provide rail service at ports in north america and europe and perform contract coal loading and railcar switching for industrial customers 
on december   we completed the acquisition of certain assets of freightlink for a million or million at the exchange rate on december  
our statement of operations for the year ended december   included results from gwa north pty ltd gwa north  our subsidiary that acquired certain assets from freightlink  since the acquisition date 
our results included million of revenues from gwa north and a loss from operations of million from gwa north 
the million loss from operations included a million or million at the december  exchange rate of stamp duty an australian asset transfer tax  which was directly attributable to the acquisition 
our consolidated results also included an additional million of freightlink acquisition related expenses 
gwi s subsidiary  genesee wyoming australia pty ltd gwa  historically operated freightlink s rail haulage services and provided its crews  managed its train operations and also leased locomotives and wagons to freightlink 
accordingly  in arriving at our consolidated results  we eliminated million of non freight revenues and operating expenses for these services provided to gwa north by gwa for the month of december net income attributable to gwi in the year ended december   was million  compared with net income attributable to gwi of million in the year ended december  our diluted earnings per share eps attributable to common stockholders in the year ended december   were with million weighted average shares outstanding  compared with diluted eps attributable to common stockholders of with million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ended december  income from continuing operations in the year ended december   was million  compared with income from continuing operations of million in the year ended december  our diluted eps from continuing operations attributable to our common stockholders in the year ended december   were with million weighted average shares outstanding  compared with diluted eps from continuing operations attributable to our common stockholders of with million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ended december  operating revenues increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   compared with million in the year ended december  the increase in our operating revenues was due to an increase of million  or  from existing operations and million from gwa north 
when we discuss either revenues from existing operations or same railroad revenues  we are referring to the change in our revenues  period over period  associated with operations that we managed in both periods ie  excluding the impact of acquisitions 
freight revenues increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   compared with million in the year ended december  the million increase consisted of a million increase in freight revenues from existing operations and million in freight revenues from new operations 
the increase in freight revenues from existing operations included a million increase due to an increase in carloads  a million increase due to higher fuel surcharges and an million increase due to the appreciation of the australian and canadian dollars relative to the united states dollar 
non freight revenues increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   compared with million in the year ended december  non freight revenues from existing 
table of contents operations increased million  or 
the increase in non freight revenues from existing operations included a million increase in railcar switching revenues  a million increase in other operating income and a million increase in fuel sales to third parties 
the appreciation of the australian and canadian dollars relative to the united states dollar  partially offset by the depreciation of the euro relative to the united states dollar  further increased non freight revenues by million 
operating income in the year ended december   increased million  or  to million  compared with million in the year ended december  our operating ratio was in the year ended december   compared with an operating ratio of in the year ended december  our operating income in the year ended december   included million of freightlink acquisition related expenses  partially offset by an million gain associated with a legal settlement related to a past acquisition  a million net gain on sale of assets and a million reversal of accrued restructuring expenses associated with the second quarter of impairment of hcry 
our operating income in the year ended december   included a net loss on the sale and impairment of assets of million  restructuring and related expenses of million and million of legal expense associated with resolution of an arbitration proceeding  partially offset by gain on insurance recoveries of million 
during the year ended december   we generated million in cash from operating activities from continuing operations 
we paid million for the acquisition of the assets of freightlink and used million for capital expenditures 
we received million in grants from outside parties for capital spending completed in  million in cash from grants from outside parties for capital spending completed in prior years  million in proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment and million net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt 
changes in operations australia on december   through our subsidiary  gwa north  we completed the freightlink acquisition for a million or million at the exchange rate on december  
gwi s statement of operations for the year ended december   included the results from gwa north  gwi s subsidiary that acquired certain assets of freightlink  since the acquisition date 
pursuant to the business sale agreement  we acquired freightlink freight rail business between tarcoola in south australia and darwin in the northern territory of australia  certain material contracts  equipment and property leases  as well as freightlink plant  equipment and business inventory 
in addition  as part of the acquisition  we assumed debt with a carrying value of a million or million at the exchange rate on december   which represents the fair value of an a million or million at the exchange rate on december  non interest bearing loan due in as a result of the acquisition  gwa north is now the concessionaire and operator of the approximately  mile tarcoola to darwin rail line  which links the port of darwin to the australian interstate rail network in south australia 
the rail line is located on land leased to gwa north by the australasia railway corporation a statutory corporation established by legislation in the northern territory under a concession agreement that expires in gwa north is both a provider of rail haulage to customers on its railroad above rail services  as well as a track owner  charging access fees to any rail operators that run on its track below rail services 
the track access rights are regulated under a statutory access regime established by legislation in the northern territory and south australia 
our subsidiary  gwa  has historically operated freightlink rail haulage services  provided its crews  managed its train operations and leased locomotives and wagons to freightlink 
as a result of the acquisition  approximately a million or million at the december  exchange rate of annual gwa non freight revenues generated from services that have historically been provided to freightlink will be eliminated in consolidation  but this elimination will not have any effect on our operating income 

table of contents prior to the completion of the tarcoola to darwin rail line  potential mining projects located in the northern territory had no economic transportation link to an export port 
since the completion of the rail line in  there has been an increase in mineral exploration and development in the northern territory and south australia along the rail corridor 
we believe that the freightlink acquisition provides us significant organic growth opportunities as it positions us to capitalize on future mineral development in the northern territory and south australia 
we accounted for the transaction using the acquisition method of accounting under us gaap 
under the acquisition method of accounting  the assets and liabilities of freightlink have been recorded at their respective estimated acquisition date fair values and have been consolidated with those of gwi as of the acquisition date 
the final determination of these estimated fair values is subject to completion of an ongoing assessment and may differ materially from the preliminary estimate 
the foreign exchange rate used to translate the preliminary balance sheet to united states dollars was for one australian dollar which was the exchange rate on december  
the preliminary acquisition date fair values assigned to the acquired net assets were as follows dollars in thousands aud usd accounts receivable  net materials and supplies prepaid expenses and other deferred income tax assets property and equipment total assets accrued expenses long term debt net assets on january   we adopted a new accounting standard in accordance with us gaap that changed the accounting for mergers and acquisitions 
under the new accounting standard  all acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred  rather than capitalized 
we incurred million of acquisition costs related to this transaction through december   including million related to stamp duty an australian asset transfer tax 
we financed the purchase of freightlink s assets through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings of million and a million or million at the december  exchange rate under our credit agreement  as amended 
for a description of the material terms and conditions under our credit agreement  as amended  see the discussion under item liquidity and capital resources credit agreement 
canada huron central railway inc in june  we announced that our subsidiary  hcry  intended to cease its operations in the third quarter of consequently  in the second quarter of we recorded charges of million after tax associated with hcry 
these charges reflected a non cash write down of non current assets of million and restructuring expenses of million  and were partially offset by a tax benefit of million 
in september  the governments of canada and the province of ontario agreed to provide c million or million at the december  exchange rate to fund infrastructure improvements that  combined with certain customer agreements  will enable hcry to continue operations on a long term basis 
in addition  hcry expects to fund approximately million for infrastructure improvements 
as a result  we reversed million million after tax of accrued restructuring expenses related to hcry in september  as hcry no 
table of contents longer intends to cease its operations 
because of the substance of the temporary agreement hcry was operating under from august   through december   hcry s net operating earnings were included within non freight revenues as other operating income 
on january   hcry began operating under a new agreement with certain customers 
because of the substance of the new arrangement  we expect to resume reporting hcry s operating revenues and operating expenses on a gross basis within each respective line item of our statement of operations in south america ferroviaria oriental sa on september   in conjunction with our partner  unirail llc  we sold substantially all of our interests in ferroviaria oriental sa  which is located in eastern bolivia 
we recorded a net gain on the sale of our investment in bolivia of million in the third quarter of our portion of the sale proceeds totaled million  against which we applied the remaining net book value of million and direct costs of the sale of million 
discontinued operations in august  we completed the sale of of the share capital of our mexican operating subsidiary  fccm  to viablis for a net sale price of million  including the deposit of million received in november accordingly  we recorded a net gain of million on the sale within discontinued operations 
in august  we recognized a net gain of million million after tax within discontinued operations due to the receipt of insurance proceeds related to damages incurred by fccm as a result of hurricane stan in gwi will utilize capital loss carryforwards  which were previously subject to a full valuation allowance  to offset any tax on this gain 
the net assets  results of operations and cash flows of our remaining mexican subsidiary  gw servicios sa  which were classified as discontinued operations  were not material as of and for the years ended december   and we do not expect any material future adverse financial impact from our remaining mexican subsidiary 
results from continuing operations when comparing our results from continuing operations from one reporting period to another  consider that we have historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses due to economic conditions  acquisitions  competitive forces  one time freight moves  customer plant expansions and shut downs  sales of property and equipment  derailments and weather related conditions  such as hurricanes  droughts  heavy snowfall  freezing and flooding 
in periods when these events occur  results of operations are not easily comparable from one period to another 
finally  certain of our railroads have commodity shipments that are sensitive to general economic conditions  including steel products  paper products and lumber and forest products 
however  shipments of other commodities are relatively less affected by economic conditions and are more closely affected by other factors  such as inventory levels maintained at a customer power plant coal  winter weather salt and seasonal rainfall south australian grain 
as a result of these and other factors  our operating results in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to our operating results in other reporting periods 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  operating revenues overview operating revenues were million in the year ended december   compared with million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the million increase in operating revenues consisted of a million  or  increase in revenues from existing operations and million in revenues from new operations

management uses its judgment in making significant estimates in the areas of recoverability and useful life of assets  as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates described below with the audit committee of the board of directors audit committee  and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to such estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business combinations we account for businesses we acquired subsequent to january   using the acquisition method of accounting 
under this method  all acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred 
we record the underlying net assets at their respective acquisition date fair values 
as part of this process  we identify and attribute values 
table of contents and estimated lives to property and equipment and intangible assets acquired 
these determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions  including those with respect to future cash flows  discount rates and asset lives  and therefore require considerable judgment 
these determinations affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in future periods 
the results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated statement of operations beginning on the respective business s acquisition date 
previously  we accounted for businesses we acquired using the purchase method of accounting 
we allocated the total cost of an acquisition  including certain acquisition related costs  to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values 
property and equipment we record property and equipment at cost 
we capitalize major renewals or improvements  but routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred 
we incur maintenance and repair expenses to keep our operations safe and fit for existing purpose 
major renewals or improvements  however  are undertaken to extend the useful life or increase the functionality of the asset  or both 
when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense  we evaluate the substance of the respective spending 
for example  costs incurred to modify a railroad bridge  either through individual projects or pre established multi year programs  which substantially upgrade the bridge s capacity to carry increased loading and or to allow for a carrying speed beyond the original or existing capacity of the bridge  are capitalized 
however  costs for replacement of routinely wearable bridge components  such as plates or bolts  are expensed as incurred 
other than a de minimis threshold under which costs are expensed as incurred  we do not apply pre defined capitalization thresholds when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense 
unlike the class i railroads that operate over extensive contiguous rail networks  our short line and regional railroads are geographically disparate businesses that transport freight over relatively short distances 
as a result  we typically incur minimal spending on self constructed assets and  instead  the vast majority of our capital spending relates to purchased assets installed by professional contractors 
we also generally do not incur significant rail grinding or ballast cleaning expenses 
however  if and when such costs are incurred  they are expensed 
the following table sets forth our total net capitalized major renewals and improvements versus our total maintenance and repair expense for the years ended december   and gross capitalized major renewals and improvements grants from outside parties net capitalized major renewals and improvements total repairs and maintenance expense 
table of contents we depreciate our property and equipment on the straight line method over the useful lives of the road property and equipment 
the following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of our major classes of property and equipment property estimated useful life buildings and leasehold improvements years or life of lease bridges tunnels culverts years track property years equipment computer equipment years locomotives and rail cars years vehicles and mobile equipment years signals and crossing equipment years track equipment years other equipment years we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that our long lived tangible assets may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of such asset in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred 
if we identify impairment of an asset  we would report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the fair value of such asset  as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances 
losses from impairment of assets are charged to net loss gain on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses 
gains or losses on sales  including sales of assets removed during track and equipment upgrade projects  or losses incurred through other dispositions  such as unanticipated retirement or destruction  are credited or charged to net loss gain on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses 
gains are recorded when realized if the sale value exceeds the remaining carrying value of the respective property and equipment 
if the estimated salvage value is less than the remaining carrying value  we record the loss incurred equal to the respective asset s carrying value less salvage value 
there were no material losses incurred through other dispositions from unanticipated or unusual events in the years ended december   or grants from outside parties grants from outside parties are recorded as long term liabilities and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation expense over the same period during which the associated assets are depreciated 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we review the carrying values of identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill at least annually to assess impairment  since these assets are not amortized 
we perform our annual impairment test as of november th of each year  and no impairment was recognized for the years ended december   and  as a result of our annual impairment test 
additionally  we review the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever such events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the determination of fair value involves significant management judgment 
impairments are expensed when incurred 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  the impairment test compares the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

table of contents for goodwill  a two step impairment model is used 
we first compare the fair value of a respective reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the estimate of fair value of the respective reporting unit is based on the best information available as of the date of assessment  which primarily incorporates certain factors including our assumptions about operating results  business plans  income projections  anticipated future cash flows and market data 
second  if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  goodwill would be considered impaired 
the second step measures the goodwill impairment as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value 
amortizable intangible assets we perform an impairment test on amortizable intangible assets when specific impairment indicators are present 
we have amortizable intangible assets valued primarily as customer relationships or contracts  service agreements  track access agreements and proprietary software 
these intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the expected economic longevity of the customer relationship  the facility served or the length of the contract or agreement including expected renewals 
derailment and property damages  personal injuries and third party claims we maintain liability and property insurance coverage 
our primary liability policies have self insured retentions of up to million per occurrence 
with respect to the transportation of hazardous commodities  our liability policy covers sudden releases of hazardous materials  including expenses related to evacuation  as a result of a railroad accident 
personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under our liability policies 
accruals for fela claims by our railroad employees and third party personal injury or other claims are recorded in the period when such claims are determined to be probable and estimable 
our property damage policies have various self insured retentions  which vary based on type and location of the incident  that are generally less than million 
these estimates are updated in future periods as information develops 
stock based compensation the compensation committee of our board of directors compensation committee has discretion to determine grantees  grant dates  amounts of grants  vesting and expiration dates for grants to our employees under our amended and restated omnibus incentive plan the omnibus plan 
the omnibus plan permits the issuance of stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and any other form of award established by the compensation committee  in each case consistent with the omnibus plan s purpose 
under the terms of the awards  equity grants for employees generally vest over three years and equity grants for directors vest over their respective remaining terms as directors 
the grant date fair value of non vested shares  less estimated forfeitures  is recorded to compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model and straight line amortization of compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period of the grant 
two assumptions in the black scholes pricing model require management judgment  the expected life and expected volatility of the stock 
the expected life is based on historical experience and is estimated for each grant 
the expected volatility of the stock is based on historical and implied volatility 
the fair value of our restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our class a common stock on the date of grant 
for the year ended december   compensation cost from equity awards was million 
as of december   the compensation cost related to non vested awards not yet recognized was million  which will be recognized over the next three years with a weighted average period of years 
the total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated income statement for equity awards was million for the year ended december  
table of contents for the year ended december   compensation cost from equity awards was million 
the total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated income statement for equity awards was million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   compensation cost from equity awards was million 
the total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated income statement for equity awards was million for the year ended december  income taxes we account for income taxes under a balance sheet approach for the financial accounting and reporting of deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as available income tax credits and capital and net operating loss carryforwards 
in our consolidated balance sheets  these deferred obligations or benefits are classified as current or non current based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting 
a deferred income tax obligation or benefit that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting  including deferred income tax assets related to tax credit and loss carryforwards  is classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference as of the end of the year 
we evaluate on a quarterly basis whether  based on all available evidence  our deferred income tax assets will be realizable 
valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
no provision is made for the united states income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries because it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries 
if the earnings were to be distributed in the future  those distributions may be subject to united states income taxes appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
the amount of undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries as of december   was million 
other uncertainties our operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks that could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in our forward looking statements 
for a complete description of our general risk factors including risk factors of foreign operations  see item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k 
management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances to which we may be currently subject  and the financial statements accurately reflect management s best estimate of our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows for the years presented 
recently issued accounting standards see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we actively monitor our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks and use derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of certain of these risks 
we use derivatives only for purposes of managing risk associated with underlying exposures 
we do not trade or use such instruments with the objective of earning financial gains from interest rate or exchange rate fluctuations  nor do we use such instruments where there are no underlying cash exposures 
complex instruments involving leverage or multipliers are not used 
we manage our hedging positions and monitor the credit ratings of counterparties and 
table of contents do not anticipate losses due to counterparty nonperformance 
management believes that our use of derivative financial instruments to manage risk is in our best interest 
however  our use of derivative financial instruments may result in short term gains or losses and increased earnings volatility 
interest rate risk risk sensitivity our interest rate risk results from variable interest rate debt obligations  where an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows 
the following table presents principal cash flows from our debt obligations  related weighted average annual interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair values as of december  dollars in thousands thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt series a senior notes series b senior notes other debt average annual interest rate variable rate debt revolving credit facility united states europe australia australia swingline loan united states term loan canadian term loan series c senior notes average annual interest rate total the variable interest rates presented in the table above are based on the implied forward rates in the yield curve for borrowings denominated using united states libor  australia bbsw  canadian libor and euro libor as of december  
the borrowing margin is composed of a weighted average of for united states  australia  canada and europe borrowings under our credit agreement and for our series c senior notes 
to the extent not mitigated by interest rate swap agreements  based on the table above  assuming a one percentage point increase in market interest rates  annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase by approximately million 
furthermore  if we were to refinance all of our debt obligations in the current environment  we believe we would incur interest rates no worse  and potentially better  than our current rates 
fair value of financial instruments we apply the following three level hierarchy of valuation inputs as a framework for measuring fair value level quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable market data 
level valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable 

table of contents since our long term debt is not quoted  fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on level valuation inputs  including borrowing rates we believe are currently available to us for loans with similar terms and maturities 
primary inputs into the model that will cause the fair value of our debt to fluctuate period to period include the fixed interest rates  the future interest rates  credit risk and the remaining time to maturity of the debt obligations 
we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates of our variable rate debt 
these agreements are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
to value the interest rate swaps  a discounted cash flow model is utilized 
primary inputs into the model that will cause the fair value to fluctuate period to period include the fixed interest rates  libor implied forward interest rates  credit risk and the remaining time to maturity of the interest rate swaps 
management s intention is to hold the interest rate swaps to maturity 
changes in the fair value of the agreements are recorded in net income or other comprehensive income loss  based on whether the agreements are designated as part of a hedge transaction and whether the agreements are effective in offsetting the change in the value of the interest payments attributable to our variable rate debt 
on october   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure to interest rates on a portion of our outstanding borrowings 
the swap has a notional amount of million and requires us to pay on the notional amount and allows us to receive one month libor 
this swap expires on september  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was estimated based on level valuation inputs 
the fair value of the interest rate swap represented a liability of million as of december  the one month libor was set at at december  foreign currency exchange risk third party debt related to our foreign operations  million  is denominated in the currency of the countries in which our subsidiaries operate  including australia  canada and europe 
the debt service obligations associated with this foreign currency debt are generally funded directly from those operations 
as a result  foreign currency risk related to our debt service payments is limited 
however  in the event foreign currency debt service  either interest  principal amortization or repayment due at maturity in october  if not refinanced  is funded from our united states operations  we may face exchange rate risk if the australian or canadian dollar or euro were to appreciate relative to the united states dollar and require higher united states dollar equivalent cash 
we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our operations  including non functional currency intercompany debt  typically from our united states operations to our foreign subsidiaries  and any timing difference between announcement and closing of an acquisition of a foreign business 
from time to time  we may enter into certain derivative instruments that may not be designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
to mitigate currency exposures related to intercompany debt  cross currency swap contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt 
in determining the fair value of the derivative contract  the significant inputs to valuation models are quoted market prices of similar instruments in active markets 
to mitigate currency exposures of non united states dollar denominated acquisitions  we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts 
although these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  we believe that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure  thus reducing the associated risk 
the gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in current period earnings within other income expense 
on december   we completed the freightlink acquisition for a million or million at the exchange rate on december  
we financed the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our credit agreement  as amended 
a portion of the funds were transferred from the united states to australia through an intercompany loan with a notional amount of a million or million at the exchange rate on december  
to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to this 
table of contents non functional currency intercompany loan  we entered into an australian dollar united states dollar floating to floating cross currency swap agreement the swap  effective as of december   which swap effectively converted the a million loan receivable in the united states into a million loan receivable 
the swap requires us to pay aud bbsw plus based on a notional amount of a million and allows us to receive united states libor plus based on a notional amount of million on a quarterly basis 
the company realized an expense of million within interest income expense related to the quarterly settlement of the swap for the period ended december  in addition  the company recognized a net loss of million within other income expense related to the mark to market of the derivative agreement and the underlying intercompany debt instrument to the exchange rate on december  this net loss was caused by a loss of million related to the mark to market of the cross currency swap and a gain of million related to the mark to market of the intercompany debt 
the fair value of the cross currency swap represented a liability of million as of december  the swap expires on december  the fair value of the cross currency swap agreement was estimated based on level valuation inputs 
on november   we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts  with funds to be delivered on december   to secure an exchange rate for a million of the a million purchase of the freightlink assets 
the subsequent decrease in the value of australian dollar versus the united states dollar between november  and december  and its impact on the a million of purchase price resulted in an additional expense of million within other income expense 
the following table summarizes the impact of these foreign currency financial instruments on our statement of operations for the year ended december  location of amount recognized in earnings amount recognized in earnings quarterly settlement under cross currency swap agreement interest expense income mark to market of intercompany debt other expense income  net  mark to market of cross currency swap agreement other expense income  net  foreign currency forward contracts other expense income  net sensitivity to diesel fuel prices we are exposed to fluctuations in diesel fuel prices since an increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in lower earnings and cash outflows 
in the year ended december   fuel costs for fuel used in operations represented of our total expenses 
as of december   we had not entered into any hedging transactions to manage this diesel fuel risk 
we receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments that offset the impact of higher fuel prices 
as of december   each one percentage point increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in a million increase in our annual fuel expense to the extent not offset by higher fuel surcharges and or rates
