item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors including the risks we discuss in item a of part i  risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are develop  manufacture  market and sell innovative treatments for aortic disorders 
our primary product is an elg for the treatment of aaa 
since  our sole source of revenue has been sales of the powerlink system 
prior to  we also generated license revenue from the licensing of our technology from a previous line of business 
for the year ended december   we had net sales of million  which was an increase of approximately from the year ended december   and we had net earnings of million 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have experienced year over year sales growth since the commercial launch of the powerlink system in the united states in we now sell our products in the united states  europe  asia and south america 
as a result of our history of operating losses  we had limited resources with which to develop additional products beyond the powerlink system 
however  in we generated approximately million of cash flow from operations and received approximately million in net proceeds from a public offering of our common stock  as well as entered into a new long term credit facility whereby we may borrow up to million 
in  we received approximately million in net proceeds from a private placement offering of our common stock to essex woodlands in connection with our acquisition of nellix 
as a result of these increases in our capital resources  we increased our research and development efforts in order to develop new technologies for the treatment of aortic disorders and we expanded the size of our direct sales force in the united states  both of which we believe are vital to the future growth of our business 
summary of accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to collectibility of customer accounts  whether the cost of inventories can be recovered  the value assigned to and estimated useful life of intangible assets  the realization of tax assets and estimates of tax liabilities  contingent liabilities and the potential outcome of litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies and estimates were used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and accounts receivable we comply with the revenue recognition guidelines in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the relevant receivable is probable at the time of sale  and products have been shipped or used and the customer has taken ownership and assumed risk of loss 
for domestic sales  we generally recognize revenue upon completion of a procedure  when our product is implanted in a patient 
for international sales  we recognize revenue at the time of shipment of our products to a distributor 
we do not offer rights of return and we have no post delivery obligations other than our specified warranty 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make 
table of contents required payments 
these estimates are based on our review of the aging of customer balances  correspondence with the customer  and the customer s payment history 
if additional information becomes available to us indicating the financial condition of the customer is deteriorating  additional allowances may be required 
inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand  as driven by economic and market conditions  and the product s shelf life 
if actual demand  or economic or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets we record an impairment charge  or expense  for long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value recorded for the asset may not be recoverable 
future changes in operations could cause us to write down the asset value and record an expense to better reflect our current estimate of its value 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired 
factors that may impact whether there is potential goodwill impairment include a significant decrease in our stock price and our evaluation of a control premium that may be used when estimating our total fair value 
our stock price may decline  or other factors may arise  which could result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
factors that may impact whether there is a potential impairment to our indefinite lived intangible assets include legal and regulatory considerations 
in process research and development  or ipr d  acquired as part of the nellix acquisition will be amortized over its useful life once commercial sales of the nellix product begin 
in determining the value of ipr d  we used the excess earnings method 
the excess earnings method reflects the present value of the operating cash flows generated by the ipr d  after taking into account the cost to realize the revenue and an appropriate discount rate to reflect the time value and risk associated with the invested capital 
the key drivers  which require significant judgment  are projected revenue and earnings generated by the project  estimated timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  the expected life of the asset  the contributory asset charges that would be paid to the requisite operating assets  and a discount rate that reflects the level of the risk associated with receiving future cash flows 
in our valuation  we projected that the nellix product will be launched internationally in the second half of  and domestically in the discount rate we used was percent 
if the nellix product is not successfully developed  our sales and profitability will be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of the acquired ipr d assets may become impaired 
our annual assessment will include a comparison of the fair value of ipr d to our existing carrying value 
we will recognize an impairment for amounts greater than the determined fair value 
in the judgment of management  the value of the nellix ipr d was million at the time of the acquisition 
as of the time of acquisition  we expect that all acquired ipr d will reach technological feasibility  but there can be no assurance that the commercial viability will actually be achieved 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technologies into commercially viable products consists principally of planning  designing and conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 
the risks associated with achieving commercialization include  but are not limited to  delay or failure to obtain regulatory approvals to conduct clinical trials  failure of clinical trials  delay or failure to obtain required market clearances  and patent litigation 
if commercial viability is not achieved  we will not realize the original estimated financial benefits 

table of contents valuation of contingent acquisition consideration payable in connection with the purchase price allocations for acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of contingent consideration payments utilizing a probability based income approach inclusive of an estimated discount rate 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates made are reasonable  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired businesses and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and any contingent consideration we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to the feasibility and timing of achievement of development  regulatory and commercial milestones  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products  and future expected cash flows from product sales 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
as part of our acquisition of nellix  we recorded a contingent acquisition consideration payable related to potential future payments based on certain milestones being met 
as of the closing date of the acquisition  we assessed the fair value of the contingent acquisition consideration payable using significant judgment in the timing of when milestones will be achieved and assumed discount periods and rates 
each period we will reassess the fair value of the contingent acquisition consideration payable and record increases in the fair value as contingent consideration expense and record decreases in the fair value as a reduction of contingent consideration expense 
increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent acquisition consideration payable can result from changes in assumed probability adjustments with respect to regulatory approval  changes in the assumed timing of when milestones will be achieved and changes in assumed discount periods and rates 
significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions each period 
accordingly  future business and economic conditions  as well as changes in any of the assumptions described in the accounting for business combinations above can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense that we record in any given period we included two contingent consideration payments in the purchase price 
the contingent consideration payments are subject to certain regulatory approvals and a revenue target  which are described below 
ous milestone the outside the us  or ous  milestone represents a contingency which concerns generating revenue in excess of million outside the us within a certain time period following our receipt of a ce mark for the nellix product 
the ce mark is a mandatory conformance mark on any products placed on the single market in the european economic area 
the right to receive the ous milestone payment extends through the expiration date of one of nellix significant patents  which is estimated to expire in may furthermore  if we experience a change of control event during the term of the ous milestone  the contingent consideration shall be paid in full  even if not achieved 
the ous milestone is subject to a payment table that provides for higher payments the earlier the milestone is met 
the set of payments range from a low of million should the milestone be reached more than years after receiving the ce mark  and a high of million should the milestone be reached within months after receiving the ce mark 
payment of the milestone will be made in shares of our common stock  and is bound by a share price floor of through expiration and a price ceiling of for months following receipt of a ce mark 
we have valued the ous milestone using a probability weighted methodology to capture the probability of milestones being achieved  a change in control event  and no event occurring 
based on our judgment  we generated a set of probabilities over an applicable term of the ous milestone 
after applying the applicable probabilities and payments with the respective payment periods  we applied an appropriate discount rate 
we have estimated the value of the ous milestone to be approximately million 
pma milestone the premarket approval  or pma  milestone represents the contingency which concerns receiving pma for the nellix product 
pma is the fda process of scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of class iii medical devices 

table of contents the right to receive the pma milestone payment extends through the expiration date of one of nellix significant patents 
furthermore  if we experience a change in control event during the term of the pma milestone  the contingent consideration shall be paid in full  even if not achieved 
if we achieve the pma milestone  we will make a payment of million less the dollar value of certain cash payments and other deductions in shares of our common stock 
furthermore  the shares issuable upon achievement of the pma milestone are bound by a share price floor of through expiration 
we have valued the pma milestone using a probability weighted methodology to capture the probability of milestones being achieved  a change in control event  and no event occurring 
after applying the applicable probabilities and payments within the respective payment periods  we applied an appropriate discount rate 
we have estimated the value of the pma milestone to be million 
income taxes our consolidated balance sheets reflect net deferred tax assets that primarily represent the tax benefit of net operating loss carryforwards and credits and timing differences between book and tax recognition of certain revenue and expense items  net of a valuation allowance 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance for the amount that may not be realized 
each quarter  we evaluate the need to retain all or a portion of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
our evaluation considers historical earnings  estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
adjustments to the valuation allowance increase or decrease net income loss in the period such adjustments are made 
if our estimates require adjustments  it could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we continually review the adequacy and necessity of the valuation allowance 
if it is more likely than not that we would not realize the deferred tax benefits  then all or a portion of the valuation allowance may need to be re established 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense over a stock option award vesting period based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value stock option grants 
the fair value for awards that are expected to vest is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term 
the amount of expense attributed is net of an estimated forfeiture rate  which is updated as appropriate 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our common stock  pre vesting forfeiture rate and the option s expected life 
the financial statements include such amounts based on our best estimates and judgments 
we amortize restricted stock grants on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the grant 
if vesting is dependent on reaching certain milestones  or adjusted based on the timing of reaching milestones  we use significant judgment in estimating the likelihood and timing of achieving the milestones 
each period  we will reassess the likelihood and estimate the timing of reaching the milestones  and will adjust expense accordingly 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and sales 
sales increased to million in from million in domestic sales increased from million to million 
the increase in domestic sales was primarily due to the expanded size and increased productivity of our sales force  and the market introduction of new powerlink sizes and powerfit aortic extensions 
sales to distributors outside the united states increased from million in to million in this increase was driven primarily by the release of the intuitrak delivery system to most of our international distributors 
we expect that product sales will increase in by an estimated to from  to million to million 
based on the timing of new product launches and continued improvements in sales force productivity  we expect that the majority of the revenue growth will be weighted in the second half of the year 
outside the united states  we expect growth in each of our major markets of europe  asia  and south america 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue  which includes labor  overhead  materials and parts  rent  depreciation  small tools and supplies  samples for destructive testing  and utilities  among other items  increased from million in to million in  due to an increase in the volume of endologix elg sales 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue decreased to in from in the percentage decline in the cost of revenue was due to a more favorable product mix  volume related efficiencies  and utilization of our in house eptfe graft material for products sold to our 
table of contents distributor in japan 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in the increase in gross profit resulted from higher sales in as compared to and an increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from in to in the increase in gross profit percentage was due to the introduction of new powerlink sizes and powerfit aortic extensions into the domestic market and cost efficiencies due to higher volume 
we believe that gross profit dollars will increase in due to higher commercial sales of our powerlink system both in and outside of the united states  a full year of impact from the new products launched in mid  and due to the introduction of additional new products in the second half of we expect that gross profit as a percentage of revenues in will be largely unchanged from research  development and clinical 
research  development and clinical expenses increased by to million from million in the increase primarily resulted from costs associated with enhancing and expanding our endologix elg product line  our acquisition of balloon expandable stent technology  our acquisition of the nellix technology  and costs associated with our percutaneous endovascular aneurysm repair  or pevar  clinical trial 
we expect that these expenses will continue to significantly increase in as we pursue opportunities to develop additional new products for the treatment of aortic disorders  particularly the development of the nellix technology  and costs associated with the pevar clinical trial 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses increased by to million from million in this increase was due to higher variable compensation expense on the growth in domestic sales revenue and an increase in the number of staffed sales territories 
we expect that marketing and sales expenses will increase in due to higher commission expense on the expected increase in sales  higher compensation costs associated with the expected increase in the number of domestic sales territories  and costs associated with the development of a direct sales organization in europe during general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million from million in the increase was due to million of acquisition and diligence costs associated with our acquisition of nellix  and million in legal costs associated with patent disputes 
we expect that general and administrative expenses in will decrease from legal costs associated with patent disputes are expected to be greater in than in  but the costs related to our acquisition of nellix are non recurring 
other expense 
other expense increased to  in from  in the increase in other expense was primarily due to losses related to foreign currency exchange offset by lower interest expense due to lower debt 
we do not expect to incur any significant other income or expense in income tax benefit 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in the year ended december  the income tax benefit is related to the release of valuation allowances of approximately million primarily due to additional deferred tax liabilities related to the ipr d we recorded from the nellix acquisition 
comparison of years ended december  and sales 
sales increased to million in from million in primarily due to the increased productivity of our sales force  the introduction of new products  including powerlink xl  our suprarenal proximal extension  and the intuitrak delivery system  and increased physician acceptance of the powerlink system 
domestic sales increased from million to million  and sales to distributors outside the united states increased from million in to million in this increase was driven primarily by the introduction of intuitrak to most of our international distributors 
additionally  we had higher sales to our distributors in south america and japan and an initial sale generating stocking order from our distributor in china 
cost of revenue 
the cost of revenue  which includes labor  overhead  materials and parts  rent  depreciation  small tools and supplies  samples for destructive testing  and utilities  among other items  increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of powerlink system sales  partially offset by efficiencies in our manufacturing process 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in the increase in gross profit resulted from higher sales in as compared to and from a favorable product mix due to new product introductions  which have a higher average selling price 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in 
table of contents for these reasons 
research  development and clinical 
research  development and clinical expenses increased by to million from million in the increase primarily resulted from costs associated with the development of new products for the treatment of aortic disorders 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses increased by to million from million in this increase was due to higher sales commission payouts on the growth in domestic sales revenue and an increase in marketing efforts related to our product launches in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by to million from million in the decrease was primarily due to  in costs associated with our chief executive officer succession  which occurred in may  and significant legal fees that occurred in these reductions were partially offset by higher stock based compensation charges and incentive compensation accruals based on performance metrics in other income expense 
other income expense decreased to  in from  in an increase in interest income was offset by expenses related to interest expense incurred in the first three quarters of liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december  and  we incurred net earnings losses of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
historically  we have relied on the sale and issuance of equity securities to provide a significant portion of funding for our operations 
in august  we completed a sale of our common stock that resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
during  we generated positive cash flows from operations for the first time in our history 
in october  we entered into a revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank  national association  or wells fargo  whereby we may borrow up to million 
all outstanding amounts under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to the greater of day libor  the federal funds rate  or the lender s prime rate  plus  which is payable on a monthly basis 
the unused portion is subject to an unused revolving line facility fee  payable quarterly  in arrears  on a calendar year basis  in an amount equal to per annum of the average unused portion of the revolving line  as determined by wells fargo 
the credit facility also contains customary covenants regarding operations of our business and financial covenants relating to ratios of current assets to current liabilities and tangible net worth during any calendar quarter and is collateralized by all of our assets with the exception of our intellectual property 
all amounts owing under the credit facility will become due and payable on april  as of december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under this credit facility  however  the company is reporting a tangible net worth of million and  therefore  is not in compliance with one covenant 
we have obtained a waiver from our lender whereby the lender has agreed to forbear from enforcing their default rights under the agreement for this specified instance 
the waiver does not apply to any subsequent breaches of the same provision nor any breach of any other provision specified within the agreement 
on december   we issued and sold to essex woodlands fund vii  and essex woodlands fund vii purchased from us  an aggregate of  unregistered shares of our common stock  at purchase price of per share  resulting in gross proceeds to us of million 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we used million of operating cash flow in we believe that our current cash balance  and borrowings available under our credit facility  will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for operating and capital expenditures through at least december  if we do not realize expected revenue and gross profit margin levels  are unable to manage our operating expenses in line with our revenues  or cannot maintain our days sales outstanding accounts receivable level  we may need to obtain additional financing 
we believe that the future growth of our business will depend upon our ability to successfully develop new technologies for the treatment of aortic disorders and bring these technologies to market  and to increase the size and productivity of our direct sales force 
in order to achieve these objectives  we may need to seek additional sources of financing 
in the event that we require additional funding  we will attempt to raise the required capital through either debt or equity arrangements 
the timing and amount of our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the need for additional capital to fund future development programs or sales force expansion  the need for additional capital to fund business development acquisition s  our requirements for additional facility space or manufacturing capacity  our requirements for additional information technology infrastructure and systems  and 
table of contents adverse outcome s from current or future litigation and the cost to defend such litigation 
if we are required to obtain additional financing  we may not be able to do so on acceptable terms  if at all 
even if we are able to obtain such financing it may cause substantial dilution for our stockholders  in the case of an equity financing  or may contain burdensome restrictions on the operations of our business  in the case of debt financing 
accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable  net  increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase was due to the increase in sales in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of inventories 
inventories increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily the result of the increased number of product codes available for sale 
accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase is primarily attributable higher accruals in related to incentive bonus and commission programs and accruals related to our acquisition of nellix 
cash provided by used in operations 
in  cash used in operations was million as compared to cash provided by operations of million in the change was primarily attributed to the increases noted above in both operating expenses and working capital 
cash used in investing activities 
cash used in investing activities increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was due to the additional property and equipment purchases in and a decrease in restricted cash in cash provided by financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the difference was primarily as a result of a million loan being paid off in in addition  there were more proceeds from the sale of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan and from the exercise of stock options 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements 
commitments 
as of december   expected future cash payments related to contractual obligations were as follows total in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations short term debt interest expense on borrowings total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not believe that we currently have material exposure to interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or other relevant market risks 
interest rate and market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our revolving credit facility 
under our revolving credit facility all outstanding amounts bear interest at a variable rate equal to the greater of day libor  the federal funds rate  or the lender s prime rate  plus 
as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
we may be exposed to market risk with respect to the revolving line of credit due to changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and try to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
at 
table of contents december   our investment portfolio consisted of money market instruments 
foreign currency transaction risk 
we do not currently have material foreign currency exposure as the majority of our assets are denominated in us currency and our foreign currency based transaction exchange risk is not material 
for the years ended december    and  we recorded   and  respectively  of foreign currency transaction gains losses
