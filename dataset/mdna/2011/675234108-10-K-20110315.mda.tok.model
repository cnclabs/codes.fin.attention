item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview oceanfirst financial corp 
has been the holding company for oceanfirst bank since it acquired the stock of the bank upon the bank s conversion from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered capital stock savings bank in the conversion 
the company conducts business  primarily through its ownership of the bank which operates its administrative branch office located in toms river and twenty two other branch offices 
eighteen of the offices are located in ocean county  new jersey  with four branches in monmouth county and one in middlesex county 
the bank also operates one loan production office in kenilworth  new jersey and a trust and wealth management office in manchester  new jersey 
the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on the company s interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the company also generates non interest income such as income from loan sales  reverse mortgage loan originations  loan servicing  merchant check card services  deposit account services  the sale of alternative investments  trust and asset management services and other fees 
the company s operating expenses primarily consist of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment  federal deposit insurance  data processing  marketing  and other general and administrative expenses 
the company s results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory agencies 
strategy the company operates as a consumer oriented bank  with a strong focus on its local community 
the bank is the oldest and largest community based financial institution headquartered in ocean county  new jersey 
the bank competes with generally larger and out of market financial service providers through its local focus and the delivery of superior service 
the company s strategy has been to consistently grow profitability while limiting credit and interest rate risk exposure 
to accomplish these objectives  the bank has sought to grow commercial loans receivable through the offering of commercial lending services to local businesses  grow core deposits defined as all deposits other than time deposits through de novo branch expansion and product offerings appealing to a broadened customer base  and increase non interest income by expanding the menu of fee based products and services 
with industry consolidation eliminating most locally headquartered competitors  the company saw an opportunity to fill a perceived void for locally delivered commercial loan and deposit services 
as such  the bank assembled an experienced team of business banking professionals responsible for offering commercial loan and deposit services and merchant check card services to local businesses 
as a result of this initiative  commercial loans represented of the bank s total loans at december  as compared to at december  and only at december  commercial loan growth in was million  or  as the bank successfully competed for high quality credits from larger  out of market competitors 
the diversification of the bank s loan products entails a higher degree of credit risk than is involved in one to four family residential mortgage lending activity 
as a consequence  management continues to employ a well defined credit policy focusing on quality underwriting and close management and board monitoring 
the bank seeks to increase core deposit market share in its primary market area by expanding the branch network and improving market penetration 
over the past fifteen years through december   the bank has opened fifteen branch offices  eleven in ocean county and four in monmouth county 
the bank is continually evaluating additional office sites within its existing market area 
at december   the fifteen most recently opened branches maintained an average core deposit ratio of 
core account development has also benefited from bank efforts to attract business deposits in conjunction with its commercial lending operations and from an expanded mix of retail core account products 
additionally  marketing and incentive plans have focused on core account growth 
as a result of these efforts the bank s core deposit ratio has grown to at december  as compared to at december  and only at december  core deposits are generally considered a less expensive and more stable funding source than certificates of deposit 

table of contents management continues to diversify the bank s product line in order to enhance non interest income 
the bank offers alternative investment products annuities  mutual funds and life insurance for sale through its retail branch network 
the products are non proprietary  sold through a third party vendor  and provide the bank with fee income opportunities 
in early  the alternative investment program was expanded to add licensed bank employees which allows the bank to capture more of the revenue associated with the sale of investment products 
the bank introduced trust and asset management services in early and has also expanded the non interest income received from small business relationships including merchant services 
as a result of these initiatives  income from fees and service charges has increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  and only million for the year ended december  during  the bank began offering reverse mortgage loans 
the bank was previously approved by fnma and another institutional investor as a seller servicer of reverse mortgage loans 
in late  the bank began selling all reverse mortgage loan production to an institutional investor with servicing released 
the gain on sale from selling reverse mortgages is included in the net gain on sales of loans and securities available for sale 
summary throughout  and continuing into  short term interest rates remained low and the interest rate yield curve was unusually steep 
the interest rate environment has generally had a positive impact on the company s results of operations and net interest margin 
interest earning assets  both loans and securities  are generally priced against longer term indices  while interest bearing liabilities  primarily deposits and borrowings  are generally priced against shorter term indices 
in the fourth quarter of  however  the company s net interest margin contracted as compared to the prior linked quarter end and the same prior year period 
the decrease was due to the investment of strong deposit flows into interest earning deposits and investment securities at modest net interest spread 
additionally  high loan refinance volume caused yields on loans and mortgage backed securities to reset downward 
the overall economy remains weak with continued high unemployment coupled with concern surrounding the housing market 
these economic conditions have had an adverse impact on the company s results of operations as non performing loans and the provision for loan losses have increased 
highlights of the company s operating results were as follows total assets increased to  million at december   an increase of from  million at december  loans receivable  net increased by million  or  to  million at december   from  million at december   primarily due to increased commercial and commercial real estate lending 
investment and mortgage backed securities increased by million to million at december   from million at december  the increase in assets was funded by increased deposits  which grew by to  million at december   from  million at december  core deposits  defined as all deposits excluding time deposits  grew million  exceeding total deposit growth of million 
growing core deposits remains one of the company s primary goals 
also  as a result of the increase in deposits  federal home loan bank advances were repaid and decreased to million at december   from million at december  net income available to common stockholders for the year ended december  was million or per diluted share  as compared to net income available to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  for the corresponding prior year period 
for the year ended december   diluted earnings per share reflects the higher number of average diluted shares outstanding from the issuance of additional common shares in november for the year ended december   diluted earnings per share includes  or 
per share  relating to a reduction in the state deferred tax valuation allowance 

table of contents net interest income for the year ended december  increased to million  as compared to million in the same prior year period  reflecting greater interest earning assets and a higher net interest margin 
the net interest margin increased to for the year ended december   from in the same prior year period partly due to the low interest rate environment 
the provision for loan losses increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the corresponding prior year period 
the provision for loan losses compares favorably with net loan charge offs of million for the year ended december  the company s non performing loans totaled million at december   an increase from million at december   with the largest increase of million attributable to one to four family mortgage loans 
the overall increase is reflective of the economic environment and extended foreclosure timelines 
the company remains well capitalized with a tangible common equity ratio of 
return on average stockholders equity was for the year ended december   as compared to for the corresponding prior year 
critical accounting policies note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contains a summary of significant accounting policies 
various elements of these accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
certain assets are carried in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or the lower of cost or fair value 
policies with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance for loan losses  the reserve for repurchased loans  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and judgments regarding securities impairment are the most critical accounting policies because they are important to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations  involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
the use of different judgments  assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in the results of operations or financial condition 
these critical accounting policies and their application are reviewed periodically and  at least annually  with the audit committee of the board of directors 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio based on management s evaluation of the risks inherent in the bank s loan portfolio and the general economy 
the bank maintains the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income 
charge offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where management determines that the collection of loan principal is unlikely 
recoveries made on loans that have been charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses when payment is received 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount management considers sufficient to provide for probable losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio resulting from management s continuing analysis of the factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  current economic conditions  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  and the determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loan 
the bank s allowance for loan losses consists of a specific allowance and a general allowance  each updated on a quarterly basis 
a specific allowance is determined for all loans which meet the definition of an impaired loan where the value of the underlying collateral can reasonably be evaluated  generally those loans secured by real estate 
the bank obtains an updated appraisal for all impaired loans secured by real estate 
the specific allowance represents the difference between the bank s recorded investment in the loan and the fair value of the collateral  less estimated disposal costs 
a general allowance is determined for all other classified and non classified loans 
in determining the level of the general allowance  the bank segments the loan portfolio into various loan segments and classes 
the loan portfolio is further segmented by delinquency status and risk rating 
an estimated loss factor is then applied to each risk tranche 
if a loan secured by real estate becomes days delinquent  the bank obtains an updated appraisal which is subsequently updated annually 
for these loans  the estimated loss represents the difference between the bank s recorded investment in the loan and the fair value of the collateral  less estimated selling costs 
for loans which are not days delinquent and secured by real estate  the loss factors are determined based upon historical loan loss experience  current economic conditions  regulatory environment  local competition  lending personnel  loan policies and underwriting standards  loan review system  delinquency trends  loss trends  nature and volume of the loan portfolio and concentrations of credit 

table of contents an overwhelming percentage of the bank s loan portfolio totaling  whether one to four family  consumer or commercial  is secured by real estate 
additionally  most of the bank s borrowers are located in ocean and monmouth counties  new jersey and the surrounding area 
these concentrations may adversely affect the bank s loan loss experience should real estate values decline or should the markets served experience an adverse economic downturn 
management believes the primary risk characteristics for each portfolio segment are a continued decline in the economy generally  including sustained unemployment  a decline in real estate market values and possible increases in interest rates 
any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect the borrowers ability to repay the loans  resulting in increased delinquencies  loan losses and future levels of provisions 
accordingly  the bank has provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in the loan portfolio 
although management believes that the bank has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels  additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
although management uses what it believes to be the best information available  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond the bank s control 
reserve for repurchased loans the reserve for repurchased loans relates to potential losses on loans sold which may have to be repurchased due to an early payment default  or a violation of representations and warranties 
provisions for losses are charged to gain on sale of loans and credited to the reserve  which is part of other liabilities while actual losses are charged to the reserve 
in order to estimate an appropriate reserve for repurchased loans  the bank considers recent and historical experience  product type and volume of recent whole loan sales and the general economic environment 
management believes that the bank has established and maintained the reserve for repurchased loans at adequate levels  however  future adjustments to the reserve may be necessary due to economic  operating or other conditions beyond the bank s control 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights msr the estimated origination and servicing costs of mortgage loans sold in which servicing rights are retained is allocated between the loans and the servicing rights based on their estimated fair values at the time of the loan sale 
servicing assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  net servicing income 
the estimated fair value of msr is determined through a discounted analysis of future cash flows  incorporating numerous assumptions including servicing income  servicing costs  market discount rates  prepayment speeds and default rates 
impairment of the msr is assessed on the fair value of those rights with any impairment recognized as a component of loan servicing fee income 
the fair value of msr is sensitive to changes in assumptions 
fluctuations in prepayment speed assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of msr 
in the event that loan prepayment activities increase due to increased loan refinancing  the fair value of msr would likely decline 
in the event that loan prepayment activities decrease due to a decline in loan refinancing  the fair value of msr would likely increase 
additionally  due to the economic downturn  default rates and servicing costs may increase in future periods which would result in a decline in the fair value of msr 
any measurement of msr is limited by the existing conditions and assumptions utilized at a particular point in time  and would not necessarily be appropriate if applied at a different point in time 

table of contents impairment of securities on a quarterly basis the company evaluates whether any securities are other than temporarily impaired 
in making this determination  the company considers the extent and duration of the impairment  the nature and financial health of the issuer  the ability and intent to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value and other factors relevant to specific securities  such as the credit risk of the issuer and whether a guarantee or insurance applies to the security 
if a security is determined to be other than temporarily impaired  the impairment is charged to income during the period the impairment is found to exist  resulting in a reduction to earnings for that period 
as of december   the company concluded that any unrealized losses in the securities available for sale portfolios were temporary in nature because they were primarily related to market interest rates  market illiquidity and wider credit spreads for these types of securities 
additionally  the company does not intend to sell the securities and it is more likely than not that the company will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost 
future events that would materially change this conclusion and require an impairment loss to be charged to operations include a change in the credit quality of the issuers or a determination that a market recovery in the foreseeable future is unlikely 
analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities

impact of new accounting pronouncements accounting standards certification asc  consolidation  replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly effect the entity s economic performance and i the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or ii the right to receive benefits from the entity 
the pronouncement was effective january  and did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
asc  transfers and servicing  improves the information a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets  including the effect of a transfer on an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows and the transferor s continuing involvement in the transferred assets 
asc eliminates the concept of a qualifying  special purpose entity and changes the guidance for evaluation for consolidation 
this pronouncement was effective january  and did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
accounting standards update no 
under asc requires new disclosures and clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
specifically  the update requires an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for such transfers 
a reporting entity is required to present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using level inputs 
in addition  the update clarifies the following requirements of the existing disclosure i for the purposes of reporting fair value measurement for each class of assets and liabilities  a reporting entity needs to use judgment in determining the appropriate classes of assets  and ii a reporting entity is required to include disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements 
the amendments are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the separate disclosures of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the new guidance did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements other than additional disclosures 

table of contents accounting standards update  amends asc receivables to require significant new disclosures about the credit quality of financial receivables loans and the allowance for credit losses 
the objective of the new disclosures is to improve financial statement users understanding of the nature of an entity s credit risk associated with its financing receivables  and the entity s assessment of that risk in estimating its allowance for credit losses  as well as changes in the allowance and the reasons for those changes 
the disclosures are to be presented at the level of disaggregation that management uses when assessing and monitoring the portfolio s risk and performance either by portfolio segment or by class of financing receivables 
the required disclosures include  among other things  a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment  as well as information about credit quality indicators and modified  impaired  non accrual and past due loans 
the disclosures related to period end information eg  credit quality information and the ending financing receivables balance segregated by impairment method is required in all interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after december  and is included in the company s december  consolidated financial statements 
disclosures of activity that occurs during a reporting period eg  loan modifications and the rollforward of the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment will be required in interim or annual periods beginning on or after december  january  for the company 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk irr market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from irr inherent in its lending  investment and deposit taking activities 
the company s profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent or on the same basis 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages irr 
the principal objectives of the company s irr management function are to evaluate the irr inherent in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given the company s business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with board approved guidelines 
through such management  the company seeks to reduce the exposure of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the company monitors its irr as such risk relates to its operating strategies 
the bank s board has established an asset liability committee alco consisting of members of the bank s management  responsible for reviewing the asset liability policies and irr position 
alco meets monthly and reports trends and the company s irr position to the board on a quarterly basis 
the extent of the movement of interest rates  higher or lower  is an uncertainty that could have an impact on the earnings of the company 
the bank utilizes the following strategies to manage irr emphasizing the origination for portfolio of fixed rate mortgage loans generally having terms to maturity of not more than fifteen years  adjustable rate loans  floating rate and balloon maturity commercial loans  and consumer loans consisting primarily of home equity loans and lines of credit  attempting to reduce the overall interest rate sensitivity of liabilities by emphasizing core and longer term deposits  and managing the maturities of wholesale borrowings 
the bank may also sell fixed rate mortgage loans into the secondary market 
in determining whether to retain fixed rate mortgages or to purchase fixed rate mortgage backed securities  management considers the bank s overall irr position  the volume of such loans originated or the amount of mbs to be purchased  the loan or mbs yield and the types and amount of funding sources 
the bank periodically retains fixed rate mortgage loan production or purchases fixed rate mbs in order to improve yields and increase balance sheet leverage 
during periods when fixed rate mortgage loan production is retained  the bank generally attempts to extend the maturity on part of its wholesale borrowings 
for the past few years  the bank has sold most year fixed rate mortgage loan originations in the secondary market 
the company currently does not participate in financial futures contracts  interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of off balance sheet derivative financial instruments  but may do so in the future to manage irr 

table of contents the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
accordingly  during a period of rising interest rates  an institution with a negative gap position theoretically would not be in as favorable a position  compared to an institution with a positive gap  to invest in higher yielding assets 
this may result in the yield on the institution s assets increasing at a slower rate than the increase in its cost of interest bearing liabilities 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  an institution with a negative gap might experience a repricing of its assets at a slower rate than its interest bearing liabilities  which  consequently  may result in its net interest income growing at a faster rate than an institution with a positive gap position 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is monitored through the use of an irr model 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which were anticipated by the company  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
at december   the company s one year gap was positive 
as compared to positive 
at december  except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table is intended to provide an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december   on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
loans receivable reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and anticipated prepayments of adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans  and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans 
loans were projected to prepay at rates between and annually 
mortgage backed securities were projected to prepay at rates between and annually 
savings accounts  interest bearing checking accounts and money market deposit accounts were assumed to decay  or run off  at per month 
prepayment and decay rates can have a significant impact on the company s estimated gap 
there can be no assurance that projected prepayment rates for loans and mortgage backed securities will be achieved or that projected decay rates for deposits will be realized 

table of contents at december  months or less more than months to year more than year to years more than years to years more than years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets interest earning deposits and short term investments investment securities fhlb stock mortgage backed securities loans receivable total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities money market deposit accounts savings accounts interest bearing checking accounts time deposits fhlb advances securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percent of total interest earning assets interest earning assets are included in the period in which the balances are expected to be redeployed and or repriced as a result of anticipated prepayments  scheduled rate adjustments and contractual maturities 
for purposes of the gap analysis  loans receivable includes loans held for sale and non performing loans gross of the allowance for loan losses  unamortized discounts and deferred loan fees 
interest sensitivity gap represents the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
certain shortcomings are inherent in gap analysis 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and decay rates would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in the calculation 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate loans may be impaired in the event of an interest rate increase 
another method of analyzing an institution s exposure to irr is by measuring the change in the institution s net portfolio value npv and net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
npv is the difference between the net present value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of an irr model which measures irr by modeling the change in npv and net interest income over a range of interest rate scenarios 
the ots also produces an npv only analysis using its own model  based upon data submitted on the bank s quarterly thrift financial reports 
the results produced by the ots may vary from the results produced by the company s model  primarily due to differences in the assumptions utilized including estimated loan prepayment rates  reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates 
the following table sets forth the company s npv and net interest income projections as of december  and  as calculated by the company in thousands 
for purposes of this table  the company used prepayment speeds and deposit decay rates similar to those used in calculating the company s gap 

table of contents at december   the company s npv in a static rate environment is relatively unchanged from the npv at december  the increase in the percentage change in npv in the basis point rate shock is a result of an increase in year fixed rate mortgage backed securities and fixed rate investment securities 
the changes in net portfolio value and net interest income are within the limitations established by management and approved by the board of directors 
december  december  change in interest rates in basis points net portfolio value net interest income change in interest rates in basis points net portfolio value net interest income rate shock amount change npv ratio amount change rate shock amount change npv ratio amount change static static   as is the case with the gap calculation  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the npv and net interest income irr measurements 
the model requires the making of certain assumptions which may tend to oversimplify the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
first  the model assumes that the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured 
second  the model assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
third  the model does not take into account the company s business or strategic plans 
accordingly  although the above measurements do provide an indication of the company s irr exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s npv and net interest income and can be expected to differ from actual results
