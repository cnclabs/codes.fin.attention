off balance sheet arrangements the company is party to certain financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business as a registered securities broker dealer and futures commission merchant and from its market making and proprietary trading in the foreign exchange and commodities trading business 
as part of these activities  the company carries short positions 
for example  it sells financial instruments that it does not own  borrows the financial instruments to make good delivery  and therefore is obliged to purchase such financial instruments at a future date in order to return the borrowed financial instruments 
the company has recorded these obligations in the consolidated financial statements at september  and september   at fair value of the related financial instruments  totaling million and million  respectively 
these positions are held to offset the risks related to financial assets owned  and reported in the company s consolidated balance sheets within financial instruments owned  at fair value  and physical commodities inventory 
the company will incur losses if the fair value of the financial instruments sold  not yet purchased  increases subsequent to september   which might be partially or wholly offset by gains in the value of assets held as of september  the total of million and million includes a net liability of million and million for derivatives  based on their fair value as of september  and september   respectively 
in the company s foreign exchange and commodities trading business segments  the company will hold options and futures contracts resulting from market making and proprietary trading activities in the company s foreign exchange commodities trading business segment 
the company assists its customers in its commodities trading business to protect the value of their future production precious or base metals by selling them put options on an otc basis 
the company also provides its commodities trading business customers with sophisticated option products  including combinations of buying and selling puts and calls 
the company mitigates its risk by effecting offsetting options with market counterparties or through the purchase or sale of exchange traded commodities futures 
the risk mitigation of offsetting options is not within the documented hedging designation requirements of the derivatives and hedging topic of the asc 
in the company c rm segment  when transacting otc and foreign exchange contracts with our customers  our otc and foreign exchange trade desks will generally offset the customer transaction simultaneously with one of our trading counterparties or will offset that transaction with a similar but not identical position on the exchange 
these unmatched transactions are intended to be short term in nature and are conducted to facilitate the most effective transaction for our customer 
derivative contracts are traded along with cash transactions because of the integrated nature of the markets for such products 
the company manages the risks associated with derivatives on an aggregate basis along with the risks associated with its proprietary trading and market making activities in cash instruments as part of its firm wide risk management policies 
the company is a member of various commodity exchanges and clearing organizations 
under the standard membership agreement  all members are required to guarantee the performance of other members and  accordingly  in the event another member is unable to satisfy its obligations to the exchange  may be required to fund a portion of the shortfall 
our liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and could exceed the cash and securities we have posted as collateral at the exchanges 
however  management believes that the potential for us to be required to make payments under these arrangements is remote 
accordingly  no contingent liability for these arrangements has been recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of september  and  respectively 
effects of inflation because the company s assets are  to a large extent  liquid in nature  they are not significantly affected by inflation 
increases in the company s expenses  such as compensation and benefits  clearing and related expenses  occupancy and equipment rental  due to inflation  may not be readily recoverable from increasing the prices of services offered by the company 
in addition  to the extent that inflation results in rising interest rates or has other adverse effects on the financial markets and on the value of the financial instruments held in inventory  it may adversely affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that the company considers the most critical to the financial statements 
the company believes these estimates and assumptions can involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgment based upon available information 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the 
table of contents difference could have a material impact on the financial statements 
therefore  understanding these policies is important in understanding the reported and potential future results of operations and the financial position of the company 
valuation of financial instruments and foreign currencies 
substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
these financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  cash  securities and other assets segregated under federal and other regulations  financial instruments purchased under agreements to resell  deposits with clearing organizations  financial instruments owned  and financial instruments sold but not yet purchased 
unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments  which are not customer owned positions  are reflected in earnings 
where available  we use prices from independent sources such as listed market prices  or broker or dealer price quotations 
fair values for certain derivative contracts are derived from pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
in some cases  even though the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote  certain assumptions may be required to determine the fair value 
however  these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current carrying value 
the value of foreign currencies  including foreign currencies sold  not yet purchased  are converted into its us dollar equivalents at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the close of business at the end of the accounting period 
for foreign currency transactions completed during each reporting period  the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time of the transaction is used 
the application of the valuation process for financial instruments and foreign currencies is critical because these items represent a significant portion of our total assets 
valuations for substantially all of the financial instruments held are available from independent publishers of market information 
the valuation process may involve estimates and judgments in the case of certain financial instruments with limited liquidity and otc derivatives 
given the wide availability of pricing information  the high degree of liquidity of the majority of our assets  and the relatively short periods for which they are typically held in inventory  there is insignificant sensitivity to changes in estimates and insignificant risk of changes in estimates having a material effect on our financial statements 
the basis for estimating the valuation of any financial instruments has not undergone any change 
revenue recognition 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived principally from realized and unrealized trading income in securities  derivative instruments  commodities and foreign currencies purchased or sold for our account 
realized and unrealized trading income is recorded on a trade date basis 
securities owned and securities sold  not yet purchased and foreign currencies sold  not yet purchased  are stated at fair value with related changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflected within trading gains in the consolidated income statements 
fee and interest income are recorded on the accrual basis and dividend income is recognized on the ex dividend date 
revenue on commodities that are purchased for physical delivery to customers and that are not readily convertible into cash is recognized at the point in time when the commodity has been shipped  title and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer  and the following conditions have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
the critical aspect of revenue recognition is recording all known transactions as of the trade date of each transaction for the financial period 
we have developed systems for each of our businesses to capture all known transactions 
recording all known transactions involves reviewing trades that occur after the financial period that relate to the financial period 
the accuracy of capturing this information is dependent upon the completeness and accuracy of data capture of the operations systems and our clearing firms 
physical commodities inventory 
physical commodities inventory is stated at the lower of cost or fair value  determined using the weighted average price method 
we generally mitigate the price risk associated with physical commodities held in inventory through the use of derivatives 
we do not elect hedge accounting under us gaap in accounting for this price mitigation 
any unrealized gains in physical commodities inventory are not recognized under us gaap  but unrealized gains and losses in related derivative positions are recognized under us gaap 
as a result  our reported commodities trading earnings are subject to volatility 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for trade receivables and deficits on customer commodity accounts 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are significant estimates  and are maintained at a level considered appropriate by our management based on reviews of historical agings of customer deficit accounts  receivables from customers  availability of capital and liquidity for specific accounts  historical trends of charge offs and recoveries  and current and projected economic  market and other conditions 
if we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we establish a specific allowance for a potential bad debt expense to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
additionally  different assumptions  changes in economic circumstances or the deterioration of the financial condition of our customers could result in additional provisions to the allowances for doubtful accounts and increased bad debt expense 
the valuation of the allowances for doubtful accounts is performed on a quarterly 
table of contents basis 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
we record the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of our individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill  our reporting units are primarily units that are one level below our reportable operating segments as defined within the segment reporting topic of the asc 
we estimate the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a matter of judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
our estimate of the fair value of each of the reporting units were in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of their annual goodwill impairment tests for intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in reviewing for impairment  the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset recorded value  an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the intangible asset to its estimated fair value 
the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management 
if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value  we could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period 
loss contingencies 
we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
quarterly  we review the status of each significant matter and assesses its potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the consolidated provision for income taxes and in evaluating tax positions  including evaluating uncertainties 
as a result  the company recognizes tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due 
these tax liabilities are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable  we believe that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by the relevant tax authorities 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  management considers all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies 
in the event that we changes our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law 
this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve series of complex judgments about future events 
to the extent that new information becomes available which causes us to change our judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities  such changes to tax liabilities will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
the consolidated provision for income taxes will change period to period based on non recurring events  such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax law  as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes  state and local taxes  and the effects of various global income tax strategies

interest rate risk in the ordinary course of our operations  we have interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect the values of financial instruments and impact interest income earned 
we generate interest income from the positive spread earned on customer deposits 
we typically invest in us treasury bills and obligations issued by government sponsored entities  reverse repurchase agreements involving us treasury bills and government obligations or aa rated money market funds 
we have an investment policy which establishes acceptable standards of credit quality and limits the amount of funds that can be invested within a particular fund and institution 

table of contents we continue to employ an interest rate risk management strategy  implemented in april  that uses derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage a portion of our aggregate interest rate position 
our objective is to invest the majority of customer segregated deposits in high quality  short term investments and swap the resulting variable interest earnings into the medium term interest stream  by using a strip of interest rate swaps that mature every quarter  and enable us to achieve the two year moving average of the two year swap rate 
in  operating revenues include realized gains of million and unrealized losses of million on interest rate swap derivative contracts used to manage a portion of our aggregate interest rate position 
in  operating revenues included realized and unrealized gains of million and million  respectively  on interest rate swap derivative contracts 
these interest rate swaps are not designated for hedge accounting treatment  and changes in the marked to market valuations of these interest rate swaps  which are volatile and can fluctuate from period to period  are recorded in earnings on a quarterly basis 
as of september   billion in notional principal of interest rate swaps were outstanding with a weighted average life of months 
we manage interest expense using floating rate debt and periodically through interest rate swap transactions 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for information on the interest rate swap transactions 
the debt instruments are carried at their unpaid principal balance which approximates fair value 
all of the company outstanding debt as of september   has a variable interest rate
