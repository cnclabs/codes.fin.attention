competition in order to grow our business  we must be able to compete effectively for aum 
we compete in all aspects of our business with other investment management companies  some of which are part of substantially larger organizations 
we have historically competed principally on the basis of investment performance  continuity of investment professionals  quality of service provided to clients  corporate positioning and business reputation  
table of contents continuity of our selling arrangements with intermediaries  and differentiated products 
for information on the competitive risks we face  see risk factors risks related to our industry the investment management business is intensely competitive

regulatory environment and compliance our business is subject to extensive regulation in the us at both the federal and state level  as well as by self regulatory organizations and outside the us under these laws and regulation  agencies that regulate investment advisors have broad administrative powers  including the power to limit  restrict or prohibit an investment advisor from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations 
possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees  limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time  revocation of investment advisor and other registrations  censures and fines 
sec regulation artio global management llc is registered with the sec as an investment advisor pursuant to the advisers act  and our retail investment company clients are registered under the act 
as compared to other disclosure oriented us federal securities laws  the advisers act and the act  together with the sec s rules  regulations and interpretations thereunder  are highly restrictive regulatory statutes 
the sec is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the advisers act and the act  ranging from fines and censures to termination of an advisor s registration 
under the advisers act  an investment advisor whether or not registered under the advisers act has fiduciary duties to its clients 
the sec has interpreted these duties to impose standards  requirements and limitations on  among other things trading for proprietary  personal and client accounts  allocations of investment opportunities among clients  use of soft dollars  execution of transactions  and recommendations to clients 
on behalf of our mutual fund and investment advisory clients  we make decisions to buy and sell securities for each portfolio  select broker dealers to execute trades and negotiate brokerage commission rates 
in connection with these transactions  we may receive soft dollar credits from broker dealers that have the effect of reducing certain of our expenses 
if our ability to use soft dollars were reduced or eliminated as a result of the implementation of new regulations  our operating expenses would likely increase 
the advisers act also imposes specific restrictions on an investment advisor s ability to engage in principal and agency cross transactions 
as a registered advisor  we are subject to many additional requirements that cover  among other things  disclosure of information about our business to clients  maintenance of written policies and procedures  maintenance of extensive books and records  restrictions on the types of fees we may

a majority of our revenues are derived from our advisory services to investment companies registered under the act  such as mutual funds 
the act imposes significant requirements and limitations on a registered fund  including with respect to its capital structure  investments and transactions 
while we exercise broad discretion over the day to day management of these funds  every fund is also subject to oversight and management by a board of directors  a majority of whom are not interested persons under the act 
the responsibilities of the board include  among other things  approving our advisory contract with the fund  approving service providers  determining the method of valuing assets  and monitoring transactions involving affiliates 
our advisory contracts with these funds may be terminated by the funds on not more than days notice  and are subject to annual renewal by the fund s board after an initial two year term

for information about our regulatory environment  see risk factors risks related to our industry the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to continual change and regulatory developments designed to increase oversight may adversely affect our business 

table of contents item a 
risk factors we face a variety of significant and diverse risks  many of which are inherent in our business 
described below are certain risks that we currently believe could materially affect us 
other risks and uncertainties that we do not now consider to be material or of which we are not now aware may become important factors that affect us in the future 
the occurrence of any of the risks discussed below could materially and adversely affect our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
risks related to our business we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of our strategies 
as of december   of our assets under management aum were invested in the international equity i and international equity ii strategies  and of our investment management fees for the year ended december  were attributable to fees earned from those strategies 
as a result  our operating results are substantially dependent upon the performance of those strategies and our ability to attract positive net client flows and retain assets within those strategies 
in addition  our smaller strategies  due to their size  may not be able to generate sufficient fees to cover their expenses 
if a significant portion of the investors in either the international equity i or international equity ii strategies decided to withdraw their investments or terminate their investment management agreements for any reason  including poor investment performance or adverse market conditions  our revenues from those strategies would decline and it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
our results have been impacted in and by net client cash outflows from these strategies 
difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways  including by reducing the value of our aum and causing clients to withdraw funds  each of which could materially reduce our revenues and adversely affect our financial condition 
the fees we earn under our investment management agreements are typically based on the market value of our aum 
investors in open end funds can redeem their investments in those funds at any time without prior notice and our clients may reduce the aggregate amount of aum with us for any number of reasons  including investment performance  changes in prevailing interest rates and financial market performance 
clients in commingled funds and separately managed accounts may redeem their investments typically with to days notice 
in addition  the prices of the securities held in the portfolios we manage may decline due to any number of factors beyond our control  including  among others  a declining stock market  general economic downturn  political uncertainty or acts of terrorism 
during extreme periods of market illiquidity  we may be forced to accept a lower price on securities in order to meet redemption requests 
as we have seen in connection with the market dislocations of and  as well as during  amid challenging economic and market conditions  the pace of client redemptions or withdrawals from our investment strategies could accelerate if clients move assets to investments they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk 
if our aum decline for any of these reasons  it would result in lower investment management fees 
for example  during and the early part of  the global economic and financial crisis led to dramatic declines across financial markets 
global equity markets fell  particularly as the financial crisis intensified in the third and fourth quarters of and the first quarter of the significant declines in stock prices worldwide resulted in substantial withdrawals from equity funds during throughout the asset management industry 
if our investment strategies perform poorly  clients could withdraw their funds and we could suffer a decline in assets under management and or become subject to litigation which would reduce our earnings 
the relative performance of our investment strategies is critical in retaining existing clients as well as attracting new clients 
if our investment strategies perform poorly  as our international equity strategies did during and  our earnings could be reduced because our existing clients may withdraw their funds from our investment strategies  which would cause the revenues that we generate from investment management fees to decline  
table of contents our morningstar and lipper ratings may decline  which may adversely affect our ability to attract new assets or retain existing assets  especially assets in the artio global funds  third party financial intermediaries  advisors or consultants may rate our investment products poorly  which may lead our existing clients to withdraw funds from our investment strategies or to reduce asset inflows from these third parties or their clients  or the mutual funds and other investment funds that we advise or sub advise may decide not to renew or to terminate the agreements pursuant to which we advise or sub advise them and we may not be able to replace these relationships 
our investment strategies can perform poorly for a number of reasons  including general market conditions and investment decisions that we make 
for instance  investment decisions to overweight or underweight specific markets  sectors or individual stocks may lead our strategies to underperform 
additionally  currency positioning relative to the benchmark may be a detractor 
in contrast  when our strategies experience strong results relative to the market or other asset classes  clients allocations to our strategies may increase relative to their other investments and we could suffer withdrawals as our clients rebalance their investments to fit their asset allocation preferences 
while clients do not have legal recourse against us solely on the basis of poor investment results  if our investment strategies perform poorly  we are more likely to become subject to litigation brought by dissatisfied clients 
in addition  to the extent clients are successful in claiming that their losses resulted from fraud  negligence  willful misconduct  breach of contract or other similar misconduct  such clients may have remedies against us  our investment funds  our investment professionals and or our affiliates under the federal securities laws and or state law 
the loss of any key investment professionals  including messrs 
pell and younes  or members of our senior management team and senior marketing personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we depend on the skills and expertise of qualified investment professionals and our success depends on our ability to retain the key members of our investment team and to attract new qualified investment professionals 
in particular  we depend on messrs 
pell and younes  who were the architects of our international equity strategies 
messrs 
pell and younes  as well as other key members of our investment team  possess substantial experience in investing and have developed strong relationships with our clients 
the loss of either of messrs 
pell or younes or any of our other key investment professionals could limit our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and may prevent us from sustaining the performance of our investment strategies or adversely affect our ability to retain existing and attract new client assets 
in addition  our investment professionals and senior marketing personnel have direct contact with our institutional separate account clients and their consultants  and with key individuals within each of our other distribution sources and the loss of these personnel could jeopardize those relationships and result in the loss of such accounts 
we do not carry any key man insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of messrs 
pell or younes or other key members of senior management  our investment team  or senior marketing personnel 
we also anticipate that it will be necessary for us to hire additional investment professionals  both within our existing teams and as we further diversify our investment products and strategies 
competition for employees with the necessary qualifications is intense and we may not be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel 
our ability to retain and attract these personnel will depend heavily on the amount of compensation we offer 
compensation levels in the investment management industry are highly competitive and can fluctuate significantly from year to year 
consequently  our profitability could decline as we compete for personnel 
an inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could affect our ability to provide acceptable levels of service to our clients and funds and hinder our ability to attract new clients and investors to our strategies  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents the historical returns of our existing investment strategies may not be indicative of their future results or of the investment strategies we are in the process of developing 
we have presented the historical returns of our existing investment strategies under business investment strategies  products and performance 
the historical returns of our strategies and the rankings we have received in the past should not be considered indicative of the future results of these strategies or of any other strategies that we may be in the process of developing or that we may develop in the future 
our strategies returns have benefited during some periods from investment opportunities and positive economic and market conditions 
our strategies have also experienced performance results below specified benchmarks 
notably  our international equity strategies performed well below their benchmark during and also underperformed their benchmark to a lesser extent during most of our investment strategies consist of investments in the securities of companies located outside of the united states  which may involve foreign currency exchange  tax  political  social and economic uncertainties and risks 
as of december   approximately of our aum across our investment strategies were invested in strategies that primarily invest in securities of companies located outside the united states 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect the returns of our clients who are invested in these strategies 
in addition  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to non us currencies is likely to result in a decrease in the us dollar value of our aum  which  in turn  could result in lower us dollar denominated revenue 
investments in non us issuers may also be affected by tax positions taken in countries or regions in which we are invested as well as political  social and economic uncertainty  particularly as a result of the recent decline in economic conditions 
many financial markets are not as developed  or as efficient  as the us financial market  and  as a result  liquidity may be reduced and price volatility may be higher 
liquidity may also be adversely affected by political or economic events within a particular country  and by increasing the aggregate amount of our investments in smaller non us issuers 
non us legal and regulatory environments  including financial accounting standards and practices  may also be different  and there may be less publicly available information in respect of such companies 
these risks could adversely affect the performance of our strategies that are invested in securities of non us issuers 
during  concerns surrounding an escalating sovereign debt crisis centered on the eurozone led the euro to decline relative to the us dollar 
as a result  this decline in the euro magnified negative returns within many european markets in us dollar terms 
our ability to retain and attract qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance 
our people are our most important resource and competition for qualified employees is intense 
in order to attract and retain qualified employees  we must compensate our employees at competitive rates and we strive to remain above the median for our peer group 
typically employee compensation is a significant expense  is highly variable and changes with performance 
if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees  or do so at rates necessary to maintain our competitive position  or if compensation costs required to attract and retain employees increase  our performance  including our competitive position  could be materially adversely affected 
our compensation program is designed to attract  retain and motivate employees  however  in the event our investment strategies underperform or there is a general deterioration of market conditions  a lack of motivation or productivity among employees may result  even if compensation levels remain competitive 
additionally  we utilize equity awards as part of our compensation strategy and as a means for recruiting and retaining highly skilled talent 
a decline in our stock price or a failure of employees to meet the goals set by the performance based awards  could result in a significant deterioration in the value of restricted stock units granted  thus lessening the effectiveness of retaining employees through stock based awards 
for example  the awards that were granted in connection with our ipo in have significantly declined in value 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel 

table of contents we derive substantially all of our revenues from contracts that may be terminated on short notice 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment advisory and sub advisory agreements  almost all of which are terminable by clients upon short notice 
our investment management agreements with proprietary funds  as required by law  are generally terminable by the funds board of directors  or a vote of the majority of the funds outstanding voting securities on not more than days written notice 
after an initial term  each fund s investment management agreement must be approved and renewed annually by the independent members of such fund s board of directors 
our sub advisory agreements are generally terminable on not more than days notice 
these investment management agreements may be terminated or not renewed for any number of reasons 
the decrease in revenues that could result from the termination of a material contract could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we depend on third party distribution sources to market our investment strategies and access our client base 
our ability to grow our aum is highly dependent on access to third party intermediaries  including rias and broker dealers 
we also provide our services to retail clients through mutual fund platforms and sub advisory relationships 
as of december   our largest mutual fund platform represented approximately of our total aum  our largest intermediary accounted for approximately of our total aum and our largest sub advisory relationship represented approximately of our total aum 
we cannot assure you that these sources and client bases will continue to be accessible to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the absence of such access could have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
our institutional separate account business is highly dependent upon referrals from pension fund consultants 
many of these consultants review and evaluate our products and our firm from time to time 
poor reviews or evaluations of either a particular product or of us may result in client withdrawals or may impair our ability to attract new assets through these intermediaries 
as of december   the consultant advising the largest portion of our client assets under management represented approximately of our aum 
in addition  the recent economic downturn and consolidation in the broker dealer industry have led to increased competition to market through broker dealers and higher costs  and may lead to reduced distribution access and further cost increases 
we have experienced both significant growth and significant declines in aum from through no particular period may be indicative of future performance 
our aum increased from approximately billion as of december  to approximately billion as of december   and then declined to billion as of december   and have stabilized as of year end in and at billion and billion  respectively 
future growth of our business will depend on a variety of factors including  among other things  global market conditions and volatility  our ability to devote sufficient resources to maintaining existing investment strategies and developing new investment strategies  our success in producing attractive returns from our investment strategies  our ability to extend our distribution capabilities  our ability to deal with changing market conditions and changing appetites for investment strategies  our ability to maintain adequate financial and business controls and our ability to comply with new legal and regulatory requirements arising in response to both the increased sophistication of the investment management market and the significant market and economic events of the last several years 
in addition  the growth in our assets under management since december  has benefited from a general depreciation of the us dollar relative to many foreign currencies 
this general decline in the us dollar also added to the allure of international investments on the part of us dollar based investors seeing to capitalize on these trends 
these trends may not continue 
for example  concerns surrounding the sovereign debt crisis within the eurozone have led to declines in the euro 
in addition  if we believe that in order to continue to produce attractive returns from our investment strategies we should close certain of those strategies to new investors  we may choose to do so 
also  we expect there to be significant demands on our infrastructure and investment teams and we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage our growing business effectively or that we will be able to sustain the level of growth we have achieved historically  and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and control our expenses 

table of contents our failure to comply with investment guidelines set by our clients  including the boards of mutual funds  could result in damage awards against us and a loss of aum  either of which could cause our earnings to decline 
as an investment advisor  we have a fiduciary duty to our clients 
when clients retain us to manage assets on their behalf  they generally specify certain guidelines regarding investment allocation and strategy that we are required to follow in the management of their portfolios 
in addition  the boards of mutual funds we manage generally establish similar guidelines regarding the investment of assets in those funds 
we are also required to invest the mutual funds assets in accordance with limitations under the investment company act of  as amended the act and applicable provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
our failure to comply with these guidelines and other limitations could result in losses to a client or an investor in a fund which  depending on the circumstances  could result in our making clients or fund investors whole for such losses 
if we believed that the circumstances did not justify a reimbursement  or clients and investors believed the reimbursement offered was insufficient  they could seek to recover damages from us or could withdraw assets from our management or terminate their investment management agreement 
any of these events could harm our reputation and cause our earnings to decline 
we outsource a number of services to third party vendors and if they fail to perform properly  we may suffer financial loss and liability to our clients 
we have developed a business model that is primarily focused on our investment strategies 
accordingly  we seek to outsource  whenever appropriate  support functions 
the services we outsource include middle and back office activities such as trade confirmation  trade settlement  custodian reconciliations  investment performance calculations and client reporting services as well as our front end trading system and data center  data replication  file transmission  secure remote access and disaster recovery services 
the ability of the third party vendors to perform their functions properly is highly dependent on the adequacy and proper functioning of their communication  information and computer systems 
if these systems of the third party vendors do not function properly  or if the third party vendors fail to perform their services properly or choose to discontinue providing services to us for any reason  or if we are unable to renew any of our key contracts on similar terms or at all  it could cause our earnings to decline or we could suffer financial losses  business disruption  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation 
operational risks may disrupt our business  result in losses or limit our growth 
we are heavily dependent on the capacity and reliability of the communications  information and technology systems supporting our operations  whether owned and operated by us or by third parties 
operational risks such as human trading errors or interruption of our financial  accounting  trading  compliance and other data processing systems  whether caused by fire  other natural disaster or pandemic  power or telecommunications failure  act of terrorism or war or otherwise  could result in a disruption of our business  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage  and thus materially adversely affect our business 
the risks related to trading errors are increased by the recent extraordinary market volatility  which can magnify the cost of an error 
for example  for the years ended through we experienced trading errors that cost us approximately million  million and million  respectively 
insurance and other safeguards might not be available or might only partially reimburse us for our losses 
although we have back up systems in place  our back up procedures and capabilities in the event of a failure or interruption may not be adequate 
the inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions also could constrain our ability to expand our businesses 
additionally  any upgrades or expansions to our operations and or technology may require significant expenditures and may increase the probability that we will suffer system degradations and failures 
we also depend on access to our headquarters in new york city  where a majority of our employees are located  for the continued operation of our business 
any significant disruption to our headquarters could have a material adverse effect on us 
employee misconduct could expose us to significant legal liability and reputational harm 
we are vulnerable to reputational harm as we operate in an industry where integrity and the confidence of our clients are of critical importance 
our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our 
table of contents business 
for example  if an employee were to engage in illegal or suspicious activities  we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation as a consequence of the negative perception resulting from such activities  financial position  client relationships and ability to attract new clients 
our business often requires that we deal with confidential information 
if any of our employees were to improperly use or disclose this information  we could suffer serious harm to our reputation  financial position and current and future business relationships 
it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct  and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not always be effective 
misconduct by our employees  or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct  could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business 
if our techniques for managing risk are ineffective  we may be exposed to material unanticipated losses 
in order to manage the significant risks inherent in our business  we must maintain effective policies  procedures and systems that enable us to identify  assess and manage the full spectrum of our risks including market  fiduciary  operational  legal  regulatory and reputational risks 
our risk management methods may prove to be ineffective due to their design or implementation  or as a result of the lack of adequate  accurate or timely information or otherwise 
if our risk management efforts are ineffective  we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results 
additionally  we could be subject to litigation  particularly from our clients  and sanctions or fines from regulators 
our techniques for managing risks in client portfolios may not fully mitigate the risk exposure in all economic or market environments  or against all types of risk  including risks that we might fail to identify or anticipate 
any failures in our risk management techniques and strategies to accurately quantify such risk exposure could limit our ability to manage risks in those portfolios or to seek positive  risk adjusted returns 
in addition  any risk management failures could cause portfolio losses to be significantly greater than historical measures predict 
our more qualitative approach to managing those risks could prove insufficient  exposing us to material unanticipated losses in the value of client portfolios and therefore a reduction in our revenues 
our failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our business 
potential  perceived and actual conflicts of interest are inherent in our existing and future investment activities 
for example  certain of our strategies have overlapping investment objectives and potential conflicts of interest may arise with respect to our decisions regarding how to allocate investment opportunities among those strategies 
in addition  investors or holders of our class a common stock may perceive conflicts of interest regarding investment decisions for strategies in which our investment professionals  who have and may continue to make significant personal investments  are personally invested 
potential  perceived or actual conflicts of interest could give rise to investor dissatisfaction  litigation or regulatory enforcement actions 
adequately addressing conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and we could suffer significant reputational harm if we fail  or appear to fail  to adequately address potential  perceived or actual conflicts of interest 
our use of leverage may expose us to substantial risks that may adversely affect our growth strategy and business 
in september  holdings established a million credit facility consisting of a million three year term credit facility and a million three year revolving credit facility which was increased to million in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement in january 
in october  holdings borrowed million under the term credit facility 
the incurrence of this debt exposes us to the typical risks associated with the use of leverage 
increased leverage makes it more difficult for us to withstand adverse economic conditions or business plan variances  to take advantage of new business opportunities  or to make necessary capital expenditures 
the agreements governing our debt facilities contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to conduct our business  including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
a substantial portion of our cash flow could be required for debt service and  as a result  might not be available for our operations or other purposes 
any substantial decrease in net operating cash flows or any substantial increase in expenses could make it difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements or force us to modify our operations 
our level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to 
table of contents economic downturns and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business  regulatory and economic conditions 
we are subject to risks relating to new initiatives which may adversely affect our growth strategy and business 
a key component of our growth and diversification strategy is to focus on achieving superior  long term investment performance 
any new initiative we pursue will be subject to numerous risks  some unknown and some known  which may be different from and in addition to the risks we face in our existing business  including  among others  risks associated with newly established strategies without any operating history  risks associated with potential  perceived or actual conflicts of interest  risks relating to the misuse of confidential information  risks due to potential lack of liquidity in the securities in which these initiatives invest and risks due to a general lack of liquidity in the global financial market that could make it harder to obtain equity or debt financing 
in developing any new initiatives  we may decide to utilize the expertise and research of our current investment professionals  which may place significant strain on resources and distract our investment professionals from the strategies that they currently manage 
this reliance on our existing investment teams may also increase the possibility of a conflict of interest arising  given the differing fee structures associated with these new initiatives 
our growth strategy may require significant investment  including capital commitments to seed new products and to fund additional operating expenses as well as the hiring of additional investment professionals  which may place significant strain on our financial  operational and management resources 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve our growth strategy or that we will succeed in any new initiatives 
failure to achieve or manage such growth could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business investment strategies  products and performance new initiatives 
failure to effectively manage our cash flow  liquidity and capital position could negatively affect our business 
we expect to fund our currently planned operations with existing capital resources  including cash flows from operations and our debt facility 
we continue to strengthen our liquidity and capital position 
if we are unable to effectively manage our cash flows and liquidity position or unable to continue to generate and maintain positive operating cash flows and operating income in the future  we may not be able to repay our debt obligations  compensate for an increase in expenses  pay dividends to stockholders or invest in our business 
failure to comply with fair value pricing  market timing and late trading policies and procedures may adversely affect us 
the us securities and exchange commission sec has adopted rules that require mutual funds to adopt fair value pricing procedures to address time zone arbitrage  selective disclosure procedures to protect mutual fund portfolio information and procedures to ensure compliance with a mutual fund s disclosed market timing policy 
recent sec rules also require our mutual funds to ensure compliance with their own market timing policies 
our mutual funds are subject to these rules and  in the event of our non compliance  we may be required to disgorge certain revenue 
in addition  we could have penalties imposed on us  be required to pay fines or be subject to private litigation  any of which could decrease our future income  or negatively affect our current business or our future growth prospects 
during periods of market volatility there is often an increased need to adjust a security s price to approximate its fair value 
this in turn increases the risk that we could breach the fair value pricing and market timing rules 
we may not be able to maintain our current fee structure as a result of industry pressure to reduce fees or as a result of changes in our business mix  which could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations 
we may not be able to maintain our current fee structure as a result of industry pressures to reduce fees or as a result of changes in our business mix 
although our investment management fees vary from product to product  historically we have competed primarily on the basis of our performance and not on the level of our 
table of contents investment management fees relative to those of our competitors 
in recent years  however  there has been a general trend toward lower fees in the investment management industry 
in order to maintain our fee structure in a competitive environment  we must be able to continue to provide clients with investment returns and service that incentivize our investors to pay our fees 
we cannot assure you that we will succeed in providing investment returns and service that will allow us to maintain our current fee structure 
the board of directors of each mutual fund we manage must make certain findings as to the reasonableness of our fees and can renegotiate them annually which has  in the past  led to a reduction in fees 
fee reductions on existing or future new business could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and or results of operations 
we may suffer losses from our seed capital investments 
in september  we launched and seeded a global credit hedge fund with million of firm capital  which will aim to deliver absolute returns with low volatility and a low correlation to other asset classes by exploiting overlooked areas of value in stressed capital structures and under researched international credits utilizing the experience of our investment teams 
we also plan to launch and seed a local emerging market debt fund in the first quarter of  seeding it with million of firm capital  which will aim to provide a high level of total return consisting of income and capital appreciation by investing in fixed income instruments denominated in emerging market currencies 
we also plan to make investments of approximately million into our us equity strategies in conjunction with the redemption of gam holding ag s gam investments in the funds 
see item business investment strategies  products and performance new initiatives 
we could suffer losses from these seed capital investments to the extent that the market risk associated with the investments is not hedged 
further  our efforts to hedge any potential market risk in these funds could be unsuccessful 
the cost of insuring our business and providing benefits to our employees is substantial and may increase 
our insurance costs are substantial and can fluctuate significantly from year to year 
insurance costs increased in  as coverage was extended to meet the needs of being a public company  but have decreased in even with an increase in the firm s insurance coverage 
in addition  certain insurance coverage may not be available or may only be available at prohibitive costs 
as we renew our insurance policies  we may be subject to additional costs resulting from rising premiums  the assumption of higher deductibles and or co insurance liability and  to the extent certain of our us funds purchase separate director and officer and or error and omission liability coverage  an increased risk of insurance companies disputing responsibility for joint claims 
higher insurance costs and incurred deductibles would reduce our net income 
a change of control of our company could result in termination of our investment advisory agreements 
under the act  each of the investment advisory agreements for sec registered mutual funds that our subsidiary  investment adviser  advises automatically terminates in the event of an assignment 
each fund s board and shareholders must therefore approve a new agreement in order for our subsidiary to continue to act as its advisor 
in addition  under the advisers act each of the investment advisory agreements for the separate accounts we manage may not be assigned without the consent of the client 
an assignment of our subsidiary s investment management agreements may occur if  among other things  investment adviser undergoes a change of control 
if such an assignment occurs  we cannot be certain that investment adviser will be able to obtain the necessary approvals from the boards and shareholders of the sec registered funds that it advises  or the necessary consents from clients whose funds are managed pursuant to separate accounts 
under the act  if an sec registered fund s investment advisor engages in a transaction that results in the assignment of its investment management agreement with the fund  the advisor may not impose an unfair burden on that fund as a result of the transaction for a two year period after the transaction is completed 
our ipo constituted a change of control for purposes of the act 
we obtained all necessary approvals in connection with the ipo  but for the two years following the ipo  we will remain subject to the limits on unfair burdens which could be adverse to our interests 

table of contents risks related to our industry we are subject to extensive regulation 
we are subject to extensive regulation in the united states  primarily at the federal level  including regulation by the sec under the exchange act  the act and the advisers act  by the department of labor under the employee retirement income security act of  as amended  or erisa  as well as regulation by the financial industry regulatory authority  inc  or finra  and state regulators 
the mutual funds we manage are registered with the sec as investment companies under the act 
the advisers act imposes numerous obligations on investment advisors including record keeping  advertising and operating requirements  disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities 
the act imposes similar obligations  as well as additional detailed operational requirements  on registered investment companies  which must be strictly adhered to by their investment advisors 
in addition  our mutual funds are subject to the usa patriot act of  which requires each fund to know certain information about its clients and to monitor their transactions for suspicious financial activities  including money laundering 
the us office of foreign assets control  or ofac  has issued regulations requiring that we refrain from doing business  or allowing our clients to do business through us  in certain countries or with certain organizations or individuals on a list maintained by the us government 
our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines  censure  suspensions of personnel or other sanctions  including revocation of the registration of any of our subsidiaries as a registered investment advisor 
in addition to the extensive regulation to which our asset management business is subject in the united states  we are also subject to regulation internationally by the ontario securities commission  the irish financial institutions regulatory authority and the hong kong securities and futures commission 
further  as our international distribution channels expand  we will be subject to an increasing amount of international regulation 
our business is already subject to the rules and regulations of the more than countries in which we currently conduct investment activities 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we invest could result in fines  suspensions of personnel or other sanctions 
see item business regulatory environment and compliance 
the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to continual change and regulatory developments designed to increase oversight may adversely affect our business 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder  the sarbanes oxley act and sec regulations  have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with accessing the us public markets 
this has resulted in significant changes in the legislative and regulatory environment in which we operate and while there is an ordinary evolution to regulation  we believe there will be further regulatory changes as a result of the recent changing laws  which will result in subjecting participants to additional regulation 
the requirements imposed by our regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with us  and are not designed to protect our stockholders 
consequently  these regulations often serve to limit our activities  including through customer protection and market conduct requirements 
new laws or regulations  or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations  applicable to us and our clients may adversely affect our business 
our ability to function in this environment will depend on our ability to constantly monitor and promptly react to legislative and regulatory changes 
for investment management firms in general  there have been a number of highly publicized regulatory inquiries that focus on the mutual fund industry 
these inquiries already have resulted in increased scrutiny in the industry and new rules and regulations for mutual funds and their investment managers 
this regulatory scrutiny may limit our ability to engage in certain activities that might be beneficial to our stockholders 
see item business regulatory environment and compliance 
in addition  we also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self regulatory organizations 
it is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws  regulations or initiatives that may be proposed  or 
table of contents whether any of the proposals will become law 
compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business 
the investment management business is intensely competitive 
the investment management business is intensely competitive  with competition based on a variety of factors  including investment performance  continuity of investment professionals and client relationships  the quality of services provided to clients  corporate positioning and business reputation  continuity of selling arrangements with intermediaries and differentiated products 
a number of factors  including the following  serve to increase our competitive risks a number of our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  better name recognition and more personnel than we do  there are relatively low barriers impeding entry to new investment funds  including a relatively low cost of entering these businesses  the recent trend toward consolidation in the investment management industry  and the securities business in general  has served to increase the size and strength of a number of our competitors  some investors may prefer to invest with an investment manager that is not publicly traded based on the perception that publicly traded companies focus on growth to the detriment of performance  some competitors may invest according to different investment styles or in alternative asset classes that the markets may perceive as more attractive than our investment approach  some competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us  which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to investment opportunities  and other industry participants  hedge funds and alternative asset managers may seek to recruit our qualified investment professionals 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our earnings would be reduced and our business could be materially adversely affected 
the investment management industry faces substantial litigation risks which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us 
we depend to a large extent on our network of relationships and on our reputation in order to attract and retain clients 
if a client is not satisfied with our services  such dissatisfaction may be more damaging to our business than to other types of businesses 
we make investment decisions on behalf of our clients that could result in substantial losses to them 
if our clients suffer significant losses  or are otherwise dissatisfied with our services  we could be subject to the risk of legal liabilities or actions alleging negligent misconduct  breach of fiduciary duty  breach of contract  unjust enrichment and or fraud 
these risks are often difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time  even after an action has been commenced 
we may incur significant legal expenses in defending against litigation 
substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us 
failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
as a public company  we must maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and included in this annual report is management s assessment in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of while management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december   because internal control over financial reporting is complex and may change over time to adapt to changes in our business  we cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in the future 
if we are not able to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting  we may not be able to produce reliable financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the required 
table of contents dates 
matters affecting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information accurately and or on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences  including sanctions or investigations by the sec  or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules  and result in a breach of the covenants under our credit facility 
there could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements 
confidence in the reliability of our financial statements is also likely to suffer if we report  or our independent registered public accounting firm reports  a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
this could lead to a material adverse effect on our business  a decline in our share price and impair our ability to raise capital 
risks relating to our structure our ability to pay regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding company structure and applicable provisions of delaware law 
we expect to continue to pay cash dividends to holders of our class a and class c common stock on a quarterly basis 
our board of directors may  in its sole discretion  change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely 
in addition  as a holding company  we will be dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to generate earnings and cash flows and distribute them to us so that we may pay dividends to our stockholders 
we expect to cause holdings to make distributions to its members  including us 
however  its ability to make such distributions will be subject to its operating results  cash requirements and financial condition  the applicable provisions of delaware law which may limit the amount of funds available for distribution to its members  its compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness  and its other agreements with third parties 
in addition  each of the companies in the corporate chain must manage its assets  liabilities and working capital in order to meet all of its cash obligations  including the payment of dividends or distributions 
as a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions  we may not be able to make  or may have to reduce or eliminate  the payment of dividends on our class a and class c common stock 
our ability to pay taxes and expenses may be limited by our holding company structure and applicable provisions of delaware law 
as a holding company  we have no material assets other than our ownership of new class a units of holdings and we have no independent means of generating revenue 
holdings is treated as a partnership for us federal and state income tax purposes and  as such  is not subject to us federal and state income tax 
instead  taxable income is allocated to its members  ie to us and the principals 
accordingly  we incur income taxes on our proportionate share of any net taxable income of holdings and also incur expenses related to our operations 
we intend to cause holdings to distribute cash to its members ie to us and the principals 
however  its ability to make such distributions is subject to various limitations and restrictions as set forth in the preceding risk factor 
if  as a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions  we do not have sufficient funds to pay tax or other liabilities or to fund the firm s operations  we may have to borrow funds and thus  our liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we will be required to pay the principals most of the tax benefits of any depreciation or amortization deductions we may claim as a result of the tax basis step up we receive in connection with their exchanges of new class a units and our purchase of other new class a units 
any taxable exchanges by the principals of new class a units for shares of our class a common stock are expected to result in increases in the tax basis in the tangible and intangible assets of holdings connected with such new class a units 
the increase in tax basis is expected to reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future  although the internal revenue service irs  might challenge all or part of this tax basis increase  and a court might sustain such a challenge 
we entered into a tax receivable agreement with the principals  pursuant to which we agreed to pay them of the amount of the reduction  if any  in us federal  state and local income tax that we realize or are deemed to realize upon an early termination of the tax receivable agreement or a change of control  both discussed below as a result of the increases in tax basis created by their exchanges or our purchases of new 
table of contents class a units 
we have previously recorded a deferred tax asset on our historical financial statements with respect to the tax basis increase that we would have received in connection with our prior obligation to redeem certain interests of our principals 
at the time of the ipo we de recognized this deferred tax asset recorded on our balance sheet 
following the ipo  we recorded a deferred tax asset upon the exchange of each principal s new class a units for shares of our class a common stock 
in conjunction with the establishment of the deferred tax asset we established a related liability for amounts due under the tax receivable agreement 
see item financial statement and supplementary data 
note initial public offering  changes in principals interests and exchange of new class a units exchange of new class a units 
the actual increase in tax basis  as well as the amount and timing of any payments under this agreement  will depend upon a number of factors  including the price of our class a common stock at the time of the exchange  the extent to which such exchanges are taxable  the amount and timing of our income and the tax rates then applicable 
payments under the tax receivable agreement are expected to give rise to certain additional tax benefits attributable to further increases in basis or  in certain circumstances  in the form of deductions for imputed interest 
any such benefits are covered by the tax receivable agreement and will increase the amounts due thereunder 
in addition  the tax receivable agreement provides for interest accrued from the due date without extensions of the corresponding tax return to the date of payment specified by the tax receivable agreement 
we expect that  as a result of the size and increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of holdings attributable to the exchanged new class a units  the payments that we may make to the principals will be substantial 
see item financial statement and supplementary data 
note income taxes tax receivable agreement 
moreover  if we exercise our right to terminate the tax receivable agreement early  we will be obligated to make an early termination payment to the principals  or their transferees  based upon the net present value based upon certain assumptions and deemed events set forth in the tax receivable agreement  including the assumption that we would have enough taxable income in the future to fully utilize the tax benefits resulting from any increased tax basis that results from an exchange and that any new class a units that the principals or their transferees own on the termination date are deemed to be exchanged on the termination date of all payments that would be required to be paid by us under the tax receivable agreement 
if certain change of control events were to occur  we would be obligated to make payments to the principals using certain assumptions and deemed events similar to those used to calculate an early termination payment 
we will not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement if such basis increase is successfully challenged by the irs 
as a result  in certain circumstances  payments could be made under the tax receivable agreement in excess of our cash tax savings 
in addition  the availability of the tax benefits may be limited by change in law or regulations  possibly with a retroactive effect 
anti takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a change of control that our stockholders may favor  which could negatively affect the market price of our class a common stock 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders 
for example  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt 
the market price of our class a common stock could be adversely affected to the extent that the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws discourage potential takeover attempts that our stockholders may favor
