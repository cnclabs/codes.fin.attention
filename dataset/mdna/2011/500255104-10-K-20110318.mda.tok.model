item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
expansion our expansion strategy has been  and will continue to be  designed to achieve profitable growth 
at the time of our initial public offering in  we had stores in the midwest 
as of year end  we operated  stores 
we have stores in states and in every large and intermediate sized market in the united states 
additions estimated additions number of stores gross square footage in millions retail selling square footage in millions we expect approximately two thirds of our new stores in to be what we consider small stores approximately  square feet of retail space 
though our expansion rate has slowed in recent years  we will continue to focus our future expansion efforts on opportunistic acquisitions as well as fill in stores in our better performing markets 
the kohl s concept has proven to be transferable to markets across the country 
new market entries are supported by extensive advertising and promotions which are designed to introduce new customers to the kohl s concept of brands  value and convenience 
additionally  we have been successful in acquiring  refurbishing and operating locations previously operated by other retailers 
approximately one fourth of our current stores are take over locations  which facilitated our initial entry into several markets 
once a new market is established  we add additional stores to further strengthen market share and enhance profitability 
we remain focused on providing the solid infrastructure needed to ensure consistent  low cost execution 
we proactively invest in distribution capacity and regional management to facilitate growth in new and existing markets 
our central merchandising organization tailors merchandise assortments to reflect regional climates and preferences 
management information systems support our low cost culture by enhancing productivity and providing the information needed to make key merchandising decisions 

table of contents we believe the transferability of the kohl s retailing strategy  our experience in acquiring and converting pre existing stores and in building new stores  combined with our substantial investment in management information systems  centralized distribution and headquarters functions provide a solid foundation for further expansion 
distribution we receive substantially all of our merchandise at nine retail distribution centers 
a small amount of our merchandise is delivered directly to the stores by vendors or their distributors 
the retail distribution centers  which are strategically located through the united sates  ship merchandise to each store by contract carrier several times a week 
we also operate fulfillment centers in monroe  ohio and san bernardino  california that service our e commerce business 
see item  properties  for additional information about our distribution centers 
employees as of january   we employed approximately  associates  including approximately  full time and  part time associates 
the number of associates varies during the year  peaking during the back to school and holiday seasons 
none of our associates are represented by a collective bargaining unit 
we believe our relations with our associates are very good 
competition the retail industry is highly competitive 
management considers style  quality and price to be the most significant competitive factors in the industry 
merchandise mix  service and convenience are also key competitive factors 
our primary competitors are traditional department stores  upscale mass merchandisers and specialty stores 
our specific competitors vary from market to market 
merchandise vendors we purchase merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers 
we have terms of engagement requirements which set forth the basic minimum requirements all business partners must meet in order to do business with kohl s 
our terms of engagement include provisions regarding laws and regulations  employment practices  ethical standards  environmental and legal requirements  communication  monitoring compliance  record keeping  subcontracting and corrective action 
our expectation is that all business partners will comply with these terms of engagement and quickly remediate any deficiencies  if noted  in order to maintain our business relationship 
none of our vendors accounted for more than of our net purchases during we have no significant long term purchase commitments or arrangements with any of our suppliers  and believe that we are not dependent on any one supplier 
we believe we have good working relationships with our suppliers 
seasonality our business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal influences 
the majority of our sales and income are typically realized during the second half of each fiscal year 
the back to school season extends from august through september and represents approximately of our annual sales 
approximately of our sales occur during the holiday season in the months of november and december 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the fiscal year 
in addition  quarterly results of operations depend upon the timing and amount of revenues and costs associated with the opening of new stores 

table of contents trademarks and service marks the name kohl s is a registered service mark of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries

risk factors forward looking statements items    and a of this form k contain forward looking statements  made within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of words such as believes  anticipates  plans  may  intends  will  should  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
in addition  statements covering our future sales or financial performance and our plans  performance and other objectives  expectations or intentions are forward looking statements  such as statements regarding our liquidity  debt service requirements  planned capital expenditures  future store openings and adequacy of capital resources and reserves 
there are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements  including among others  those risk factors described below 
forward looking statements relate to the date made  and we undertake no obligations to update them 
declines in general economic conditions  consumer spending levels and other conditions could lead to reduced consumer demand for our merchandise and cause reductions in our sales and or gross margin 
consumer spending habits  including spending for the merchandise that we sell  are affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions  levels of employment  salaries and wage rates  prevailing interest rates  housing costs  energy costs  income tax rates and policies  consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions 
in addition  consumer purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers disposable income  credit availability and debt levels 

table of contents recent economic conditions have caused disruptions and significant volatility in financial markets  increased rates of default and bankruptcy and declining consumer and business confidence  which has led to decreased levels of consumer spending  particularly on discretionary items 
a continued or incremental slowdown in the us economy and the uncertain economic outlook could continue to adversely affect consumer spending habits resulting in lower net sales and profits than expected on a quarterly or annual basis 
as all of our stores are located in the united states  we are especially susceptible to deteriorations in the us economy 
consumer confidence is also affected by the domestic and international political situation 
the outbreak or escalation of war  or the occurrence of terrorist acts or other hostilities in or affecting the united states  could lead to a decrease in spending by consumers 
actions by our competitors could adversely affect our operating results 
the retail business is highly competitive 
we compete for customers  associates  locations  merchandise  services and other important aspects of our business with many other local  regional and national retailers 
those competitors  some of which have a greater market presence than kohl s  include traditional store based retailers  internet and catalog businesses and other forms of retail commerce 
unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of those competitors may adversely affect our performance 
product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and operating results 
if our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers expectations regarding safety  we could experience lost sales  experience increased costs and or be exposed to legal and reputational risk 
events that give rise to actual  potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and or private litigation 
reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns  could have a negative impact on our sales 
if we do not offer merchandise our customers want and fail to successfully manage our inventory levels  our sales and or gross margin may be adversely impacted 
our business is dependent on our ability to anticipate fluctuations in consumer demand for a wide variety of merchandise 
failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes  preferences  spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could create inventory imbalances and adversely affect our performance and long term relationships with our customers 
additionally  failure to accurately predict changing consumer tastes may result in excess inventory  which could result in additional markdowns and adversely affect our operating results 
ineffective marketing could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
in  advertising costs  net of related vendor allowances  were million 
we believe that differentiating kohl s in the marketplace is critical to our success 
we design our marketing programs to increase awareness of our brands  which we expect will create and maintain customer loyalty  increase the number of customers that shop our stores and increase our sales 
if our marketing programs are not successful  our sales and profitability could be adversely affected 
we may be unable to raise additional capital  if needed  or to raise capital on favorable terms 
in recent years  the general economic and capital market conditions in the united states and other parts of the world have deteriorated significantly and have adversely affected access to capital and increased the cost of capital 
if our existing cash  cash generated from operations and funds available on our lines of credit are insufficient to fund our future activities  including capital expenditures  or repay debt when it becomes due  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
if unfavorable capital market conditions exist if and when we were to seek additional financing  we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis if at all 
failure to obtain capital on acceptable terms  or at all  
table of contents when required by our business circumstances could have a material adverse effect on us including an inability to fund new growth and other capital expenditures 
in  we entered into a derivative product to manage our exposure to interest rates on debt that we expect to issue in late disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could lead to losses on this derivative position resulting from counterparty failures 
inefficient or ineffective allocation of capital could adversely affect our operating results and or shareholder value 
our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long term returns 
this includes spending on inventory  capital projects and expenses  managing debt levels  and periodically returning value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends 
to a large degree  capital efficiency reflects how well we manage our other key risks 
the actions taken to address other specific risks may affect how well we manage the more general risk of capital efficiency 
if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns  we may fail to produce optimal financial results and we may experience a reduction in shareholder value 
changes in our credit card operations could adversely affect our sales and or profitability 
our credit card operations facilitate sales in our stores and generate additional revenue from fees related to extending credit 
the proprietary kohl s credit card accounts have been sold to an unrelated third party  but we share in the net revenues of the program according to a fixed percentage 
net revenues are settled monthly and include finance charge and late fee revenues  less write offs of uncollectible accounts and other expenses 
in august  we entered into a private label credit card program agreement with capital one  national association capital one  which will be effective upon transition of the outstanding receivables from our former partner to capital one 
we currently expect this transition to occur in the first fiscal quarter of kohl s and capital one will share in the net risk adjusted revenue of the portfolio  which is defined as the sum of finance charges  late fees and other revenue less write offs of uncollectible accounts 
changes in funding costs related to interest rate fluctuations will be shared similar to the revenue 
though management currently believes that increases in funding costs will be largely offset by increases in finance charge revenue  increases in funding costs could adversely impact the profitability of this program 
changes in credit card use  payment patterns and default rates may also result from a variety of economic  legal  social and other factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty 
changes that adversely impact our ability to extend credit and collect payments could negatively affect our results 
weather conditions could adversely affect our sales and or profitability by affecting consumer shopping patterns 
because a significant portion of our business is apparel and subject to weather conditions in our markets  our operating results may be adversely affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions 
frequent or unusually heavy snow  ice or rain storms or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures in our markets could adversely affect our performance by affecting consumer shopping patterns or diminishing demand for seasonal merchandise 
our business is seasonal  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our business is subject to seasonal influences  with a major portion of sales and income historically realized during the second half of the fiscal year  which includes the back to school and holiday seasons 
this seasonality causes our operating results to vary considerably from quarter to quarter and could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

table of contents we may be unable to source merchandise in a timely and cost effective manner  which could adversely affect our sales and operating results 
approximately of the merchandise we sell is sourced through a third party purchasing agent 
the remaining merchandise is sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors 
all of our vendors must comply with applicable laws and our required terms of engagement 
our ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge which is typically even more difficult with respect to goods sourced outside the united states 
political or financial instability  trade restrictions  tariffs  currency exchange rates  transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade  and the ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms are beyond our control and could adversely impact our performance 
if any of our vendors were to become subject to bankruptcy  receivership or similar proceedings  we may be unable to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts  transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as current terms  which could adversely affect our sales and operating results 
increases in the price of merchandise  raw materials  fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and negatively impact our financial results 
we are beginning to experience inflation in our merchandise  raw materials  fuel and labor costs 
the cost of cotton  which is a key raw material in many of our products  has had the most dramatic increases 
the price and availability of cotton may fluctuate substantially  depending on a variety of factors  including demand  acreage devoted to cotton crops and crop yields  weather  supply conditions  transportation costs  energy prices  work stoppages  government regulation and government policy  economic climates  market speculation and other unpredictable factors 
fluctuations in the price and availability of fuel  labor and raw materials  such as cotton  have not materially affected our cost of goods in recent years  but an inability to mitigate these cost increases  unless sufficiently offset with our pricing actions  might cause a decrease in our profitability  while any related pricing actions might cause a decline in our sales volume 
additionally  any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability to meet our production or purchasing requirements in a timely manner 
both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise  raw materials  fuel and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs as well as those of our suppliers 
an inability to attract and retain quality employees could result in higher payroll costs and adversely affect our operating results 
our performance is dependent on attracting and retaining a large and growing number of quality associates 
many of those associates are in entry level or part time positions with historically high rates of turnover 
our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels  prevailing wage rates  minimum wage legislation and changing demographics 
changes that adversely impact our ability to attract and retain quality associates could adversely affect our performance 
an inability to open new stores could adversely affect our financial performance 
our plan to continue to increase the number of our stores will depend in part upon the availability of existing retail stores or store sites on acceptable terms 
increases in real estate  construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and affect our return on investment 
there can be no assurance that such stores or sites will be available for purchase or lease  or that they will be available on acceptable terms 
if we are unable to grow our retail business  our financial performance could be adversely affected 
regulatory and litigation developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance 
various aspects of our operations are subject to federal  state or local laws  rules and regulations  any of which may change from time to time 
we continually monitor the state and federal employment law environment 
table of contents for developments that may adversely impact us 
failure to detect changes and comply with such laws and regulations may result in an erosion of our reputation  disruption of business and or loss of employee morale 
additionally  we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance 
damage to the reputation of the kohl s brand or our private and exclusive brands could adversely affect our sales 
we believe the kohl s brand name and many of our private and exclusive brand names are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them 
we develop and promote private and exclusive brands that have generated national recognition 
in some cases  the brands or the marketing of such brands are tied to or affiliated with well known individuals 
damage to the reputations whether or not justified of our brand names or any affiliated individuals  could arise from product failures  litigation or various forms of adverse publicity  especially in social media outlets  and may generate negative customer sentiment  potentially resulting in a reduction in sales  earnings  and shareholder value 
disruptions in our information systems could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information systems 
in particular  we rely on our information systems to effectively manage sales  distribution  merchandise planning and allocation functions 
we also generate sales though the operations of our kohls 
com website 
the failure of our information systems to perform as designed could disrupt our business and harm sales and profitability 
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could severely damage our reputation  expose us to risks of litigation and liability  disrupt our operations and harm our business 
as part of our normal course of business  we collect  process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information 
despite the security measures we have in place  our facilities and systems  and those of our third party service providers  may be vulnerable to security breaches  acts of vandalism  computer viruses  misplaced or lost data  programming and or human errors  or other similar events 
any security breach involving the misappropriation  loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information  whether by us or our vendors  could severely damage our reputation  expose us to risks of litigation and liability  disrupt our operations and harm our business 
new legal requirements could adversely affect our operating results 
our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected by new legal requirements  including health care reform and proposed climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations 
in march  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of were signed into law in the us this legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured 
the changes required by this legislation could cause us to incur additional health care and other costs  but we do not expect any material short term impact on our financial results as a result of the legislation and are currently assessing the extent of any long term impact 
the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of the card act mandated fundamental changes in to many of our current business credit card practices  including marketing  underwriting  pricing and billing specifically restrictions on late and other penalty fees 
while we have made numerous changes designed to lessen the impact of the changes required by the card act  there is no assurance that we will be successful 
if we are not able to lessen the impact of the changes required by the card act  the 
table of contents changes could adversely impact the profitability of our credit operations and make it more difficult to extend credit to our customers and collect payments which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the costs and other effects of other new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty 
for example  new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent such requirements increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials

specific increases are dependent on the category and the related fabric content 
we have been preparing for these cost increases for some time and are working diligently to minimize the impact of these higher costs on a consumer that is still buying cautiously and  therefore  less open to paying higher prices for discretionary goods

our gross margin may not be comparable with that of other retailers because we include distribution center costs in selling  general and administrative expenses while other retailers may include these expenses in cost of merchandise sold 
gross margin increased million  or  in compared to gross margin as a percentage of sales increased basis points to for strong inventory management and increased penetration of private and exclusive brands contributed to the margin strength 
average inventory per store at year end is approximately one percent higher than clearance inventory units per store are approximately lower this year than in sales of private and exclusive brands reached of net sales for  an increase of approximately basis points over approximately percent of our merchandise receipts are now subject to our size optimization programs which has also had a positive impact on our gross margin rate 
merchandise costs across all apparel categories are expected to be up approximately to overall for fall due to inflation in the cost of raw materials  labor and fuel 
specific increases are dependent on the category and the related fabric content 
we have been preparing for these cost increases for some time and are working diligently to minimize the impact of these higher costs on a consumer that is still buying cautiously and  therefore  less open to paying higher prices for discretionary goods 
gross margin for increased million  or  over the improvement in gross margin as a percent of net sales for compared to was driven by strong merchandise and inventory management and increased penetration of private and exclusive brands 
sales of private and exclusive brands reached of net sales in  an increase of basis points over selling  general and administrative expenses 
dollars in millions selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include compensation and benefit costs including stores  headquarters  buying and merchandising and distribution centers  occupancy and operating costs of our retail  distribution and corporate facilities  freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our distribution centers to our retail stores and among distribution and retail facilities  advertising expenses  offset by vendor payments for reimbursement of specific  incremental and identifiable costs  net revenues from our kohl s credit card operations  and other administrative costs 
sg a also includes the costs incurred prior to new store openings  such as advertising  hiring and training costs for new employees  processing and transporting initial merchandise  and rent expense 
we do not include depreciation and amortization in sg a 
the classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry 
sg a for increased million  or  over  but decreased as a percentage of net sales  or leveraged 
sg a increased primarily due to store growth  higher sales  and investments in technology and infrastructure related to our e commerce business 

table of contents hourly store payroll costs leveraged in and continue to be driven by sustainable productivity improvements  such as the rollout of electronic signs 
advertising leveraged in as we intentionally grew this expense less than sales 
we continue to modify our media mix to utilize the most cost effective methods 
in  we increased direct mail and digital marketing efforts and decreased print media 
preopening expenses leveraged in as we opened fewer stores 
additionally  a significant number of the stores which opened in were leased stores which had higher rent expenses during the preopening period 
information services expenses increased as a percentage of net sales  or deleveraged  in  primarily due to planned incremental investments in technology and infrastructure related to our e commerce business 
distribution costs  which are included in sg a  totaled million for  million for and million for net revenues from the credit card program also deleveraged in due to reductions in late fee revenue as a result of legislative changes 
in connection with the april sale of our proprietary credit card accounts to jpmorgan chase co 
jpmorgan chase  we entered into a service and revenue sharing agreement 
pursuant to this agreement  jpmorgan chase issues kohl s branded private label credit cards to new and existing kohl s customers 
since we do not own the receivables  the receivables and the related allowance for bad debt reserve are not reported on our balance sheets 
risk management decisions are jointly managed by jpmorgan chase and us 
we handle all customer service functions and are responsible for all advertising and marketing related to credit card customers and the majority of the associated expenses 
net revenues of the program are shared with jpmorgan chase according to a fixed percentage and are settled monthly 
net revenues include finance charge and late fee revenues  less write offs of uncollectible accounts and other expenses 
in august  we entered into a private label credit card program agreement with capital one  national association capital one  which will be effective upon transition of the outstanding receivables from jpmorgan chase to capital one 
we currently expect this transition to happen in the first fiscal quarter of kohl s and capital one will share in the net risk adjusted revenue of the portfolio as defined by the sum of finance charges  late fees and other revenue less write offs of uncollectible accounts 
changes in funding costs related to interest rate fluctuations will be shared similar to the revenue 
though management currently believes that increases in funding costs will be largely offset by increases in finance charge revenue  increases in funding costs could adversely impact the profitability of this program 
sg a for increased million  or  over sg a increased primarily due to store growth and increased incentive compensation and changes made to our non management compensation structure 
depreciation and amortization 
in millions depreciation and amortization the increases in depreciation and amortization are primarily due to the addition of new stores and remodels 
operating income 
dollars in millions operating income as a percent of net sales 
table of contents the changes in operating income and operating income as a percent of net sales are due to the factors discussed above 
interest expense 
in millions interest expense  net net interest expense for increased million  or  over the increase is attributable to higher interest on our capital leases in net interest expense for increased million  or  over the increase is attributable to lower interest income due to lower interest rates on our investments  partially offset by higher average investments 
a reduction in capitalized interest due to lower capital expenditures in also contributed to the increase in interest expense 
income taxes 
dollars in millions provision for income taxes effective tax rate the effective tax rate for was comparable to the and tax rates 
inflation although we expect that our operations will be influenced by general economic conditions  including rising food  fuel and energy prices  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by such factors in the future 
we are beginning to experience inflation in our merchandise  raw material  labor and fuel costs 
such cost increases were not significant in  but we do expect to see low to mid single digit cost increases in the first six months of and low double digit increases in the last six months of in our private and exclusive brands  where we have more control over the production and manufacture of the merchandise  we have historically been able to minimize inflationary pressures through measures such as committing earlier for fabric and certain other raw materials and shifting production to lower cost markets 
our third party brand vendors are also facing the same inflationary pressures 
we will continue to work with these vendors in our efforts to minimize the impact of inflation on our merchandise costs and our selling prices 
liquidity and capital resources our primary ongoing cash requirements are for capital expenditures in connection with our expansion and remodeling programs and seasonal and new store inventory purchases 
our primary sources of funds are cash flow provided by operations  short term trade credit and our lines of credit 
short term trade credit  in the form of extended payment terms for inventory purchases  often represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventories 
seasonal cash needs may be met by cash on hand and or the line of credit available under our revolving credit facility 
our working capital and inventory levels typically build throughout the fall  peaking during the november and december holiday selling season 
we anticipate that we will be able to satisfy our working capital requirements  planned capital expenditures  dividend payments and debt service requirements with available cash and cash equivalents  proceeds from cash flows from operations  short term trade credit  seasonal borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other 
table of contents sources of financing 
we expect to generate adequate cash flow from operating activities to sustain current levels of operations 
as of january   we had cash and cash equivalents of billion 
we generated million of free cash flow in and expect to generate billion in see the free cash flow discussion later in this liquidity and capital resources section for additional discussion of free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure

cash provided by operations decreased in to billion 
at january   total merchandise inventories increased million  or  from year end on a dollars per store basis  merchandise inventories at january  increased from year end clearance inventory units per store are down approximately 
these changes reflect our various inventory management initiatives  including our conservative sales and receipt planning and lower clearance levels 
accounts payable at january  decreased million from year end  compared to increasing million from year end to the change is primarily due to vendor finance initiatives which are now fully implemented 
in prior years  we rolled out a receivable financing program whereby a financial institution provides our vendors with financing  at a rate which is below what the vendors could normally obtain on their own 
we offer this program to vendors in exchange for extended payment terms 
we do not incur any costs or expenses or forfeit any portion of our receivables in connection with this program 
timing of inventory purchases also contributed to the change 
accounts payable as a percent of inventory was at january   compared to at year end it has been more than a year since we implemented our vendor finance initiatives  so we no longer expect to see the significant improvement in this metric that we have seen in the past 
lower inventory turn also contributed to the decrease 
cash provided by operations increased over to billion in  primarily due to a million increase in cash flows from accounts payable activities 
accounts payable at january  increased million from year end accounts payable as a percent of inventory was at january   compared to at year end  primarily due to strong inventory management  our cycle time reduction initiatives and improved vendor financing management 
short term trade credit  in the form of extended payment terms for inventory purchases  represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventories 
compared to year end  total merchandise inventories at january  increased and inventory per store decreased 
clearance inventory units per store were down approximately 
these reductions were the result of inventory management initiatives  including our conservative sales and receipt planning and lower clearance levels 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities increased million to million in  primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures 
capital expenditures totaled million for  a million increase over this increase is primarily due to higher capital spending as a result of increased remodels  the opening of our second e commerce fulfillment center and planned incremental it investments to support our e commerce business 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in capital spending for new stores 

table of contents capital expenditures  including favorable lease rights  by major category were as follows estimate new stores remodels relocations distribution centers capitalized software fixtures and store improvements other total we expect total capital expenditures of approximately billion in fiscal due primarily to an increase in new store openings expected in compared to in 
an increase in store remodels approximately expected in compared to in  construction of a third fulfillment center to support our e commerce business and the roll out of electronic signs to additional stores will also contribute to the increase 
the actual amount of our future capital expenditures will depend primarily on the number of new stores opened  the mix of owned  leased or acquired stores  the number of stores remodeled and the timing of distribution center openings 
we do not anticipate that our expansion plans will be limited by any restrictive covenants in our financing agreements 
we believe that our capital structure is well positioned to support our expansion plans 
we anticipate that internally generated cash flows will be the primary source of funding for future growth 
sales of long term investments generated cash of million in and million in as of january   we had investments in auction rate securities ars with a par value of million and an estimated fair value of million 
ars are long term debt instruments with interest rates reset through periodic short term auctions  which are typically held every days 
beginning in february  liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for all of our ars 
a failed auction occurs when the amount of securities submitted for sale in the auction exceeds the amount of purchase bids 
as a result  holders are unable to liquidate their investment through the auction 
a failed auction is not a default of the debt instrument  but does set a new interest rate in accordance with the terms of the debt instrument 
a failed auction limits liquidity for holders until there is a successful auction or until such time as another market for ars develops 
ars are generally callable by the issuer at any time 
scheduled auctions continue to be held until the ars matures or is called 
to date  we have collected all interest payable on outstanding ars when due and expect to continue to do so in the future 
substantially all redemptions to date were made at par 
at this time  we have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of our ars or their insurers are presently at risk or that the reduced liquidity has had a significant impact on the underlying credit quality of the assets backing our ars 
while the auction failures limit our ability to liquidate these investments  we believe that the ars failures will have no significant impact on our ability to fund ongoing operations and growth initiatives 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million to million in  primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures 
capital expenditures totaled million for  a million decrease from this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the number of new store openings from in to in financing activities 
our financing activities used cash of million in and provided cash of million in the change is primarily due to treasury stock purchases in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents on november   we entered into an accelerated share repurchase transaction with morgan stanley co 
incorporated morgan stanley to repurchase billion of kohl s common stock on an accelerated basis 
this accelerated share repurchase was part of the billion share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in september on november   we paid billion to morgan stanley from cash on hand 
we received a total of million shares under the program million shares on november   million shares on december   million on january   and a final delivery of million shares on march  the total number of shares received was generally determined by the discounted average of the daily volume weighted average price of shares traded during the relevant pricing periods 
we have million of long term debt which was due in march and million of long term debt which is due in october we expect to replace this debt in the second half of in anticipation of the debt refinancing  we entered into an interest rate swap in december to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk on the first million of debt issued 
amounts related to this financial instrument were not material 
we also expect to refinance our million senior unsecured revolving facility which will expire in october in february  our board of directors approved our first ever dividend 
the cent per share quarterly dividend will be paid on march  to all shareholders of record as of march  the dividend reflects the board s confidence in our long term cash flow 
we expect to use a portion of future free cash flow to continue to pay quarterly dividends 
our board of directors also increased the remaining share repurchase authorization under our existing share repurchase program by billion  from million to billion 
we expect to execute the share repurchase program primarily in open market transactions  subject to market conditions and to complete the program by the end of fiscal our credit ratings have been unchanged since september when we issued billion in debt 
our ratings are currently as follows moody s standard poor s fitch long term debt baa bbb bbb we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through open market cash purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved could be material 
our financing activities provided cash of million in and used cash of million in the change is primarily due to treasury stock purchases in the first six months of key financial ratios 
key financial ratios that provide certain measures of our liquidity are as follows working capital in millions current ratio debt capitalization ratio of earnings to fixed charges return on gross investment return on gross investment is a non gaap financial measure 
the decrease in working capital and the current ratio as of year end compared to year end was primarily due to the reclassification of million of debt maturing in from long term to short term and the billion purchase of kohl s common stock pursuant to the accelerated stock repurchase program 
the 
table of contents debt capitalization ratio was comparable to  as share repurchases offset earnings in equity 
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was consistent with prior years 
see exhibit to this annual report on form k for the calculation of this ratio 
the increase in working capital and the current ratio as of year end compared to year end was primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalents 
the decrease in the debt capitalization ratio reflects higher capitalization  primarily due to earnings 
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was comparable to our return on gross investment roi was for  for and for the increases were primarily due to higher earnings 
roi is a non gaap financial measure which we define as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and rent ebitdar divided by average gross investment 
our roi calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
roi should be evaluated in addition to  and not considered a substitute for  other financial measures such as return on assets

free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures 
free cash flow should be evaluated in addition to  and not considered a substitute for  other financial measures such as net income and cash flow provided by operations 
we believe that free cash flow represents our ability to generate additional cash flow from our business operations

table of contents contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of january  were as follows total less than year years years more than years in millions recorded contractual obligations long term debt capital leases unrecorded contractual obligations interest payments long term debt capital leases operating leases a royalties purchase obligations b total a our leases typically require that we pay real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs in addition to the minimum rental payments included in the table above 
such costs vary from period to period and totaled million for  million for and million for b our purchase obligations consist mainly of purchase orders for merchandise 
amounts committed under open purchase orders for merchandise are cancelable without penalty prior to a date that precedes the vendors scheduled shipment date 
it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax positions may change within the next months  primarily as a result of ongoing audits 
while it is possible that one or more of these audits may be resolved in the next year  it is not anticipated that payment of any such amounts in future periods will materially affect liquidity and cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not provided any financial guarantees as of year end we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating our business 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
a discussion of the more significant estimates follows 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of our board of directors 
retail inventory method and inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the first in  first out fifo basis using the retail inventory method rim 
rim is an averaging method that has been widely 
table of contents used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
under rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of the inventories 
the use of rim will result in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
based on a review of historical clearance markdowns  current business trends  expected vendor funding and discontinued merchandise categories  an adjustment to inventory is recorded to reflect additional markdowns which are estimated to be necessary to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market 
management believes that our inventory valuation approximates the net realizable value of clearance inventory and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
vendor allowances we record vendor allowances and discounts in the income statement when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled 
allowances provided by vendors generally relate to profitability of inventory recently sold and  accordingly  are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold as negotiated 
vendor allowances received for advertising or fixture programs reduce our expense or expenditure for the related advertising or fixture program when appropriate 
vendor allowances will fluctuate based on the amount of promotional and clearance markdowns necessary to liquidate the inventory 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements  business and summary of accounting policies 
insurance reserve estimates we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation  general liability and employee related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by our associates 
we use a third party actuary  which considers historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions  to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks 
a change in claims frequency and severity of claims from historical experience as well as changes in state statutes and the mix of states in which we operate could result in a change to the required reserve levels 
we retain the initial risk of  per occurrence under our workers compensation insurance policy and  per occurrence under our general liability policy 
the lifetime medical payment limit of million per plan participant was eliminated on december  impairment of assets and closed store reserves we have a significant investment in property and equipment and favorable lease rights 
the related depreciation and amortization is computed using estimated useful lives of up to years 
we review our long lived assets held for use including favorable lease rights  goodwill and trademarks for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances  such as decisions to close a store  indicates the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we have historically not experienced any significant impairment of long lived assets or closed store reserves 
decisions to close a store can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life 
when operations at a leased store are discontinued  a reserve is established for the discounted difference between the rent and the expected sublease rental income 
a significant change in cash flows  market valuation  demand for real estate or other factors  could result in an increase or decrease in the reserve requirement or impairment charge 
income taxes we pay income taxes based on tax statutes  regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities 
our effective income tax rate was in  in and in the effective rate is impacted by changes in law  location of new stores  level of earnings and the result of tax audits 

table of contents operating leases as of january   we leased of our  retail stores 
many lease agreements contain rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
we use a time period for our straight line rent expense calculation that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation 
in addition  the commencement date of the lease term is the earlier of the date when we become legally obligated for the rent payments or the date when we take possession of the building or land 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our long term debt at year end is at fixed interest rates and  therefore  is not affected by changes in interest rates 
when our long term debt instruments mature  we may refinance them at then existing market interest rates  which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt 
cash equivalents and long term investments earn interest at variable rates and are affected by changes in interest rates 
during  average investments were billion and average yield was 
if interest rates on the average variable rate cash equivalents and long term investments increased by basis points  our annual interest income would also increase by approximately million assuming comparable investment levels 
we entered into an interest rate swap in december to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk on the first million of debt that we expect to issue in amounts related to this financial instrument were not material and we were not a party to any other material derivative financial instruments in  or
