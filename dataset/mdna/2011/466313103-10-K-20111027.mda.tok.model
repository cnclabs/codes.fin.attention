we provide comprehensive electronics design  production and product management services to companies in the aerospace  automotive  computing  consumer  defense  industrial  instrumentation  medical  networking  peripherals  solar  storage and telecommunications industries 
the industry in which we operate is composed of companies that provide a range of manufacturing and design services to companies that utilize electronics components 
the industry experienced rapid change and growth through the s as an increasing number of companies chose to outsource an increasing portion  and  in some cases  all of their manufacturing requirements 
in mid  the industry s revenue declined as a result of significant cut backs in customer production requirements  which was consistent with the overall downturn in the technology sector at the time 
in response to this downturn in the technology sector  we implemented restructuring programs to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers 
industry revenues generally began to stabilize in and companies began to turn more to outsourcing versus internal manufacturing 
in addition  the number of industries serviced  as well as the market penetration in certain industries  by electronic manufacturing service providers has increased over the past several years 
in mid  the industry s revenue declined when a deteriorating macro economic environment resulted in illiquidity in the overall credit markets and a significant economic downturn in the north american  european and asian markets 
in response to this downturn  we implemented additional restructuring programs to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers 
uncertainty remains regarding the extent and timing of the current economic recovery 
we will continue to monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers that we serve as well as our end markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can respond appropriately as circumstances continue to change 
on september   we reorganized our business into the following three segments diversified manufacturing services dms  enterprise infrastructure e i and high velocity systems hvs 
our dms segment is composed of dedicated resources to manage higher complexity global products in regulated industries and bring materials and process technologies including design and aftermarket services to our global customers 
our e i and hvs segments offer integrated global supply chain solutions designed to provide cost effective solutions for our customers 
our e i segment is focused on our customers primarily in the computing  storage  networking and telecommunication sectors 
our hvs segment is focused on the particular needs of the consumer products industry  including mobility  display  set top boxes and peripheral products such as printers and point of sale terminals 
we derive revenue principally from manufacturing services related to electronic equipment built to customer specifications 
we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from aftermarket services  design services and excess inventory sales 
revenue from manufacturing services and excess inventory sales is generally recognized  net of estimated product return costs  when goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and recoverability is reasonably assured 
aftermarket service related revenue is recognized upon completion of the services 
design service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer 
we assume no significant obligations after product shipment 
our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture  the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead  and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory 
as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services  we are responsible for procuring components and other materials 
this requires us to commit significant 
table of contents working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing  receiving  inspection and stocking of materials 
although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap  we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers 
net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product 
we refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material based revenue  and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing based revenue 
our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product 
we typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than we do on materials based revenue 
as we gain experience in manufacturing a product  we usually achieve increased efficiencies  which result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product 
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities  indirect labor costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization 
during periods of low production volume  we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins 
we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design  production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers 
to support this effort  our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers 
most of the expenses associated with these customer specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue 
in addition  our engineers engage in r d of new technologies that apply generally to our operations 
the expenses of these r d activities are reflected in the research and development line item within our consolidated statement of operations 
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities 
the majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in us dollars  while our labor and utility costs in operations outside the us are denominated in local currencies 
we economically hedge these local currency costs  based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge  through the purchase of foreign exchange contracts 
changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected within the consolidated statement of operations 
see risk factors we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations 
we currently depend  and expect to continue to depend  upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue and upon their growth  viability and financial stability 
a significant reduction in sales to any of our large customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of design  production or product management services ordered from us  including moving a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity 
there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly reduce or delay the volume of design  production or product management services ordered from us  or move a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity 
any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change  reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
see risk factors because we depend on a limited number of customers  a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue  risk factors most of our customers do not commit to long term production schedules  which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and capital expenditures  and to maximize the efficiency of our manufacturing capacity  risk factors our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities  delay production or change their sourcing strategy and note concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements 
summary of results net revenues for fiscal year increased approximately to billion compared to billion for fiscal year largely due to increased revenue from certain of our existing customers  including new program wins with these customers

table of contents key performance indicators management regularly reviews financial and non financial performance indicators to assess the company s operating results 
the following table sets forth  for the quarterly periods indicated  certain of management s key financial performance indicators 
three months ended august  may  february  november  sales cycle days days days days inventory turns annualized turns turns turns turns days in trade accounts receivable days days days days days in inventory days days days days days in accounts payable days days days days three months ended august  may  february  november  sales cycle days days days days inventory turns annualized turns turns turns turns days in trade accounts receivable days days days days days in inventory days days days days days in accounts payable days days days days the sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in trade accounts receivable and days in inventory  less the days in accounts payable  accordingly  the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators 
during the three months ended august   days in trade accounts receivable increased one day to days as compared to the prior sequential quarter as a result of the timing of sales and cash collection efforts during the quarter 
during the three months ended may   days in trade accounts receivable decreased two days to days as compared to the prior sequential quarter primarily as a result of the amendment to our foreign asset backed securitization program  which resulted in the receivables being sold to a third party financial institution  and no longer being recognized in trade accounts receivable 
during the three months ended february   days in trade accounts receivable decreased two days to days as compared to the prior sequential quarter as a result of increased use of our trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs  the timing of sales  focused efforts on cash collections during the quarter and related seasonality factors 
during the three months ended november   days in trade accounts receivable decreased seven days to days as compared to the prior sequential quarter as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance related to the transfer of financial assets  coupled with an amendment to the asset backed securitization program during the first quarter of fiscal year  which resulted in a deferred purchase price receivable being recorded to prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets at november  as compared to a retained interest on receivables sold which was recorded to trade accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets at august  refer to note trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
during the three months ended august   may  and november   days in inventory decreased one day to days  days and days  respectively  as compared to the prior sequential quarter largely due to increased sales activity during each quarter 
during the three months ended february   days in inventory increased one day to days as compared to the prior sequential quarter largely due to the acquisition of operations in france and italy 
inventory turns  on an annualized basis  remained constant at seven turns during each quarter of fiscal year during the three months ended august   may   february  and november   days in accounts payable increased three days to days  decreased three days to days  increased four days to days and decreased seven days to days  respectively  from the prior sequential quarter primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the respective quarters 
in addition  during the three months ended february  the increase in days in accounts payable was also due to the acquisition of operations in france and italy 
the sales cycle was eight days during the three months ended august   days during the three months ended may   days during the three months ended february  and days during the three months ended november  the changes in the sales cycle are due to the changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and inventory that are discussed above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon 
table of contents historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for further discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from manufacturing services related to electronic equipment built to customer specifications 
we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from aftermarket services  design services and excess inventory sales 
revenue from manufacturing services and excess inventory sales is generally recognized  net of estimated product return costs  when goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and recoverability is reasonably assured 
aftermarket service related revenue is recognized upon completion of the services 
design service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer 
we assume no significant obligations after product shipment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers 
this allowance is based on management s assessment of specific customer balances  considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer 
if there is an adverse change in the financial condition and circumstances of our customers  or if actual defaults are higher than provided for  an addition to the allowance may be necessary 
inventory valuation we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage  customer inventory related contractual obligations and other lower of cost or market considerations 
if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional valuation adjustments may be necessary 
long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected cash flows that the asset s or asset group s are expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset or asset group over its respective fair value  which is generally determined as either the present value of estimated future cash flows or the appraised value 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy or adverse economic conditions 
for further discussion of our current restructuring program  refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring and impairment charges 
we have recorded intangible assets  including goodwill  in connection with business acquisitions 
estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows 
the fair value of acquired amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts recorded as goodwill 
we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using the two step method on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an average weighting of both projected discounted future results and the use of comparative market multiples 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of loss  if any 
we completed our annual impairment test for goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that the fair values of our reporting units are substantially in excess of the carrying values and that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test 
restructuring and impairment charges we have recognized restructuring and impairment charges related to reductions in workforce  re sizing and closure of certain facilities and the transition of production from certain facilities into other new and existing facilities 
these charges were recorded 
table of contents pursuant to formal plans developed and approved by management and our board of directors 
the recognition of restructuring and impairment charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with these plans 
the estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring additional restructuring and impairment charges or the reduction of liabilities already recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with the restructuring programs 
for further discussion of our restructuring programs  refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring and impairment charges 
retirement benefits we have pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities in certain foreign locations that are developed from actuarial valuations 
actuarial valuations require management to make certain judgments and estimates of discount rates  compensation rate increases and return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions on a regular basis taking into consideration current market conditions and historical market data 
the discount rate is used to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
this rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
when considering the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we take into account current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets 
other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
for further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits  refer to note postretirement and other employee benefits to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria 
we assess whether an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return meets the threshold for recognition and measurement in the consolidated financial statements 
our judgments regarding future taxable income as well as tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws or other factors 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances and or tax reserves established may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense 
the internal revenue service irs completed its field examination of our tax returns for the fiscal years through and issued a revenue agent s report rar on april  proposing adjustments primarily related to the irs contentions that certain corporate expenses relate to services provided to foreign affiliates and therefore must be charged to those affiliates  and valuable intangible property was transferred to certain foreign affiliates without charge 
if the irs ultimately prevails in its positions  our income tax payment due for the fiscal years through would be approximately an additional million before utilization of any tax attributes arising in periods subsequent to fiscal year in addition  the irs will likely make similar claims in future audits with respect to these types of transactions at this time  determination of the additional income tax due for these later years is not practicable 
also  the irs has proposed interest and penalties on us with respect to fiscal years through  and we anticipate the irs may seek to impose interest and penalties in subsequent years with respect to the same types of issues 
we disagree with the proposed adjustments and are vigorously contesting this matter through applicable irs and judicial procedures  as appropriate 
as the final resolution of the proposed adjustments remains uncertain  we continue to provide for the uncertain tax position based on the more likely than not standards 
accordingly  we did not record any significant additional tax liabilities related to this rar on the consolidated balance sheets during fiscal year while the resolution of the issues may result in tax liabilities  interest and penalties  which are significantly higher than the amounts provided for this matter  management currently believes that the resolution will not have a material effect on our financial position or liquidity 
despite this belief  an unfavorable resolution  particularly if the irs successfully asserts similar claims for later years  could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition particularly during the quarter in which any adjustment is recorded or any tax is due or paid 
for further discussion related to our income taxes  refer to note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements and risk factors we are subject to the risk of increased taxes 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense within our consolidated statements of operations related to stock appreciation rights using a lattice model to determine the fair value 
option pricing models require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the option or stock appreciation right  risk free rate  expected dividend yield and the price 
table of contents volatility of the underlying stock 
judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock awards that are expected to vest as a result of satisfaction of time based vesting schedules or the achievement of certain performance or market conditions 
if actual results or future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates  stock based compensation expense could increase or decrease 
for further discussion of our stock based compensation  refer to note stockholders equity to the consolidated financial statements

results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net revenue fiscal year ended august  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangibles restructuring and impairment charges goodwill impairment charges settlement of receivables and related charges loss on disposal of subsidiaries operating income loss other expense interest income interest expense income loss before income tax income tax expense net income loss net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests  net of income tax expense net income loss attributable to jabil circuit  inc fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net revenue 
our net revenue increased to billion for fiscal year  up from billion in fiscal year specific increases include a increase in the sale of specialized services products  a increase in the sale of instrumentation and healthcare products  a increase in the sale of industrial and cleantech products  an increase in the sale of e i products  and an increase in the sale of hvs products 
these increases for fiscal year are primarily due to increased revenue from certain of our existing customers  including new program wins with these customers 
generally  we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition 
accordingly  we do not differentiate or report separately revenue increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business 
in addition  the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure 
the distribution of revenue across our sectors has fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  as a result of numerous factors  including but not limited to the following fluctuations in customer demand as a result of recent recessionary conditions  efforts to de emphasize the economic performance of certain sectors  most specifically  our former automotive and display sectors  seasonality in our business  and business growth from new and existing customers 
as discussed in the overview section  on september   we reorganized our business into the following three segments dms  e i and hvs 
in conjunction with this reorganization  there have been certain reclassifications made within the reported sectors 

table of contents the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  revenue by segment expressed as a percentage of net revenue fiscal year ended august  dms specialized services industrial cleantech instrumentation healthcare total dms total e i total hvs total foreign source revenue represented of our net revenue for fiscal year and of net revenue for fiscal year we currently expect our foreign source revenue to remain relatively consistent as compared to current levels over the course of the next months 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to billion of net revenue for fiscal year from billion of net revenue for fiscal year the increase in gross profit on an absolute basis and as a percentage of net revenue from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to increased revenue from certain of our existing customers  including new program wins with these customers  which allow us to better utilize capacity and absorb fixed costs  an increased focus on controlling costs and improving productivity and additional growth in the dms segment  which typically has higher margins than the e i and hvs segments 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant at million of net revenue for fiscal year compared to million of net revenue for fiscal year the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue between fiscal years and is due to an increased focus on controlling costs  as well as being able to better absorb fixed costs as revenue levels increase 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses for fiscal year decreased to million of net revenue from million of net revenue for fiscal year the decrease is primarily due to a greater portion of engineering resources working on customer funded design projects and r d activity being moved to our design centers in lower cost geographies 
amortization of intangibles 
we recorded million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease is primarily attributable to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized since august  for additional information regarding purchased intangibles  see acquisitions and expansion below  note f description of business and summary of significant accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets and note goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and impairment charges 
a 
restructuring plan upon the approval by our board of directors  we initiated a restructuring plan during the second quarter of fiscal year the restructuring plan 
we have substantially completed restructuring activities under this plan and do not expect to incur any additional costs under the restructuring plan 
during fiscal year  we reversed million of previously recognized restructuring and impairment costs  compared to charges of million of restructuring and impairment costs recorded during fiscal year at august   accrued liabilities of approximately million related to the restructuring plan are expected to be paid over the next fiscal quarter 
as of august   the restructuring plan is expected to yield annualized cost savings of approximately million  which we are now fully realizing 
the majority of these annual cost savings are expected to be reflected as a reduction in cost of 
table of contents revenue  with a small portion being reflected as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expense 
these expected annualized cost savings reflect a reduction in employee expense of approximately million  a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately million  a reduction in lease commitment costs of approximately million  a reduction of other manufacturing costs of approximately million and a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million 
as part of the restructuring plan  we have determined that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets would not be realized as a result of the contemplated restructuring activities 
therefore  we recorded a valuation allowance of million on net deferred tax assets related to the restructuring plan 
the valuation allowance is excluded from the restructuring and impairment charges incurred through august  as it was recorded to income tax expense within our consolidated statements of operations 
b 
restructuring plan upon the approval by our board of directors  we initiated a restructuring plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the restructuring plan 
we have substantially completed restructuring activities under this plan and do not expect to incur any additional costs under the restructuring plan 
during fiscal year  we recorded approximately million of restructuring and impairment costs  compared to charges of million of restructuring and impairment charges recorded during fiscal year the restructuring and impairment costs for fiscal year are primarily related to lease commitment costs 
at august   liabilities of approximately million related to the restructuring plan are expected to be paid out over the next twelve months 
the remaining liability of million relates primarily to the charge for employee severance and termination benefits payments 
settlement of receivables and related charges 
we recorded a loss on settlement of receivables and related charges of million during fiscal year during the second quarter of fiscal year  we completed our acquisition of f i holding company  which directly or indirectly wholly owns competence france holdings sas  a french entity which wholly owns competence france sas  and competence emea srl  an italian entity which wholly owns competence italia srl competence france holdings sas  competence france sas  competence emea srl and competence italia srl are collectively referred to as the competence sites herein 
the competence sites were our former operations and were previously disposed of on july  refer to note loss on disposal of subsidiaries to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  immediately prior to the acquisition of the competence sites  we recognized a charge of million in order to record million in receivables and other relationships with the competence sites at their respective fair values 
in addition  we recognized acquisition costs and other related charges of million during the second quarter of fiscal year refer to note business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
loss on disposal of subsidiaries 
we recorded a loss on disposal of subsidiaries of million during fiscal year and million during fiscal year during the first quarter of fiscal year  we sold the operations of jabil circuit automotive  sas  an automotive electronic manufacturing subsidiary located in western europe to an unrelated third party 
in connection with this sale  we recorded a loss on disposition of approximately million  which includes approximately million in transaction costs incurred in connection with the sale during the three months ended november  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we sold f i holding company  which directly or indirectly wholly owns the competence sites  to an unrelated third party 
in connection with this transaction  we provided an aggregate million working capital loan to the disposed operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a charge of million to loss on disposal of subsidiaries within the consolidated statement of operations  including million of transaction related costs and million in order to record the working capital loan at its respective fair market value at august  based upon a discounted cash flow analysis 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a charge of million to loss on disposal of subsidiaries within the consolidated statement of operations  including million to fully write off the remaining balance of the working capital loan and million to write off a purchase price related receivable that we were due from the third party purchaser as they were deemed no longer collectible 
refer to note loss on disposal of subsidiaries to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
other expense 
other expense remained relatively constant at million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  respectively 

table of contents interest income 
interest income remained relatively constant at million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year interest expense 
we recorded million of interest expense in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to interest associated with the issuance of our senior notes during the first quarter of fiscal year and the refinancing of the credit facility dated as of july  the old credit facility at market rates  which were higher than the old credit facility s  during the second quarter of fiscal year income tax expense 
income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal year  as compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal year the effective tax rate differs from the previous period due to the amount of earnings  mix of tax rates  and increase in tax incentives in the various jurisdictions in which we do business and the sale of french and italian subsidiaries in fiscal year  partially offset by the acquisition of f i holding company which owns the competence sites in fiscal year most of our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the us  primarily due to tax incentives granted to our sites in brazil  china  hungary  malaysia  poland  singapore and vietnam 
the material tax incentives expire at various dates through such tax incentives are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates income taxes  risk factors we are subject to the risk of increased taxes and note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements further discussion 
fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net revenue 
our net revenue increased to billion for fiscal year  up from billion in fiscal year specific increases include a increase in the sale of industrial and cleantech products  a increase in the sale of instrumentation and healthcare products  a increase in the sale of specialized services products  an increase in the sale of hvs products  and a increase in the sale of e i products 
these increases for fiscal year were primarily due to increased revenue from existing customers and programs as our customers confidence in their markets strengthened and their end customers demand levels increased  as well as new customer wins and new program wins with existing customers 
foreign source revenue represented of our net revenue for fiscal year and of net revenue for fiscal year for further discussion of our net revenues  refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net revenue 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to billion of net revenue for fiscal year from million of net revenue for fiscal year the increase in gross profit on an absolute basis and as a percentage of net revenue from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to increased revenue from existing customers and programs as our customers confidence in their markets strengthened and their end customers demand levels increased as well as new customer wins and new program wins with existing customers which allowed us to better utilize capacity and absorb fixed costs 
further  we realized certain cost savings associated with initiatives that we commenced in fiscal year to reduce our cost structure in order to better align with lower demand levels and increased capacity utilization which allowed us to better leverage our cost structure 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net revenue for fiscal year from million of net revenue for fiscal year the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses on an absolute basis and as a percentage of net revenue from fiscal year was largely due to increases in stock based compensation expense of million primarily due to a change in the estimated vesting of performance based restricted stock awards and incremental expense recognized related to the modification of certain existing equity awards to include retirement eligibility provisions  million related to additional salary and bonus expense due to increased headcount and results of operations in fiscal year and million related to professional fees associated with multiple internal strategic and cost saving initiatives 
research and development 
r d expenses for fiscal year increased to million of net revenue from million of net revenue for fiscal year the increase was attributed primarily to our increased focus on vertical integration capabilities in our mobility market and increased capabilities and proficiencies in digital home office and printer markets 
amortization of intangibles 
we recorded million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily attributable to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized since august  for additional information regarding purchased intangibles  see acquisitions and expansion below  note f description of business and summary of significant accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets and note goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements

goodwill impairment charges 
we recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges of billion for the full fiscal year ended august  of which the entire billion charge was incurred in the first two quarters to reduce the carrying amount of our goodwill to its estimated fair value based upon the results of two interim impairment tests conducted during the first and second quarters of fiscal year we performed these impairment tests based upon a combination of factors  including a significant and sustained decline in our market capitalization below our carrying value  the deteriorating macro economic environment  which resulted in a significant decline in customer demand  and illiquidity in the overall credit markets

refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  loss on disposal of subsidiaries for discussion of the million charge recorded to loss on disposal of subsidiaries within the consolidated statement of operations during fiscal year other expense

the decrease in other expense for fiscal year was primarily due to the recognition of a million loss on the extinguishment of million of our senior notes and a million loss on the impairment of a note receivable in fiscal year as well as a decrease in the loss on the sale of accounts receivable under our asset backed securitization program of million in fiscal year which was primarily due to a decrease in borrowing costs 
for further discussion of our accounts receivable securitization program  see note trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower overall interest rates during fiscal year interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower overall interest rates during fiscal year income tax expense 
income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal year  as compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal year the effective tax rate differs from the previous period due to the impairment of non deductible goodwill and the corresponding valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets that were no longer more likely than not to be realized in fiscal year the tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business 
most of our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the us  primarily due to tax incentives granted to our sites in brazil  china  hungary  malaysia  poland  singapore and vietnam 
the material tax incentives expire at various dates through such tax incentives are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates income taxes  risk factors we are subject to the risk of increased taxes and note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
non us gaap core financial measures the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include certain non us gaap financial measures as identified in the reconciliation below 
the non us gaap financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non us gaap financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time 
non us gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us gaap 
also  our core financial measures should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items which are excluded from our core financial measures 

table of contents management believes that the non us gaap core financial measures set forth below are useful to facilitate evaluating the past and future performance of our ongoing manufacturing operations over multiple periods on a comparable basis by excluding the effects of the amortization of intangibles  stock based compensation expense and related charges  restructuring and impairment charges  settlement of receivables and related charges  loss on disposal of subsidiaries and distressed customer charges 
among other uses  management uses non us gaap core financial measures as a factor in determining employee performance when determining incentive compensation 
we are reporting core operating income and core earnings to provide investors with an additional method for assessing operating income and earnings  presenting what we believe are our core manufacturing operations 
most of the items that are excluded for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings also impacted certain balance sheet assets  resulting in all or a portion of an asset being written off without a corresponding recovery of cash we may have previously spent with respect to the asset 
in the case of restructuring charges  we may be making associated cash payments in the future 
in addition  although  for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings  we exclude stock based compensation expense which we anticipate continuing to incur in the future because it is a non cash expense  the associated stock issued may result in an increase in our outstanding shares of stock  which may result in the dilution of our stockholders ownership interest 
we encourage you to evaluate these items and the limitations for purposes of analysis in excluding them 
included in the table below is a reconciliation of the non us gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measures as provided in our consolidated financial statements in thousands fiscal year ended august  operating income loss us gaap amortization of intangibles stock based compensation and related charges restructuring and impairment charges goodwill impairment charges settlement of receivables and related charges loss on disposal of subsidiaries distressed customer charges core operating income non us gaap net income loss attributable to jabil circuit  inc us gaap amortization of intangibles  net of tax stock based compensation and related charges  net of tax restructuring and impairment charges  net of tax goodwill impairment charges  net of tax loss on disposal of subsidiaries  net of tax distressed customer charges  net of tax settlement of receivables and related charges deferred tax valuation allowance charges other expense  net of tax core earnings non us gaap

our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition 
see risk factors we have on occasion not achieved  and may not in the future achieve  expected profitability from our acquisitions 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire telmar network technology  inc  a provider of complex reverse logistics  repair services  technical support  and spare parts management solutions for communication network service providers  enterprise and original equipment manufacturers worldwide 
completion of this transaction  which is subject to regulatory clearance and customary conditions  is expected to take place during the first half of fiscal year liquidity and capital resources at august   we had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling million  total notes payable and long term debt of billion  billion in available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities and up to million in available liquidity under our trade accounts receivable securitization and uncommitted sale programs 
as the sale programs are uncommitted  we can offer no assurance that if we attempt to draw on such programs in the future that we will receive funding from the associated banks which would require us to utilize other available sources of liquidity  including our revolving credit facilities 

table of contents the following table sets forth  for the fiscal year ended august selected consolidated cash flow information in thousands fiscal year ended august  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year was approximately million 
this resulted primarily from net income of million  million in non cash depreciation and amortization expense  a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  million in stock based compensation expense and a million decrease in trade accounts receivable  which were partially offset by a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a million increase in inventories 
the decrease in trade accounts receivable was primarily driven by the amendment to our foreign asset backed securitization program which resulted in the receivables being sold to a third party bank no longer being recognized in trade accounts receivable whereas previously the program was accounted for as a secured borrowing and an increase in the sales activity under the non foreign and foreign asset backed securitization programs 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily driven by the timing of purchases and cash payments 
the increase in inventories was primarily due to the ramp up of inventory levels to support new business wins and higher revenue levels 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily driven by an increase in the deferred purchase price receivable under the foreign asset backed securitization program and the non foreign asset backed securitization program due to the timing of cash payments and the sale of receivables under the programs 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year was million 
this consisted primarily of capital expenditures of million principally for machinery and equipment for new business  including new process technology within our dms segment  maintenance levels of machinery and equipment and information technology infrastructure upgrades  which were partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal year was million 
this resulted from our receipt of approximately billion of proceeds from borrowings under existing debt agreements  which primarily included an aggregate of billion of borrowings under the old credit facility and the amended and restated credit facility and our million of senior notes 
this was offset by repayments in an aggregate amount of approximately billion during fiscal year  which primarily included an aggregate of billion of repayments under the old credit facility and the amended and restated credit facility and million under the term portion of the old credit facility 
in addition  we paid million to acquire treasury stock and million in dividends to stockholders during fiscal year we may need to finance day to day working capital needs  as well as future growth and any corresponding working capital needs  with additional borrowings under the amended and restated credit facility and our other revolving credit facilities described below  as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity 
currently  we have a shelf registration statement with the sec 
promptly after filing this annual report on form k  as a result of our existing shelf registration statement expiring october   we anticipate terminating our existing shelf registration statement and filing a new shelf registration statement under the registration procedures set forth in the securities act 
the new shelf registration statement will register the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future  from time to time over the three years following the registration  to augment our liquidity and capital resources 
any future sale of issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to current shareholders 
further  we may issue debt securities that have rights and privileges senior to those of holders of ordinary shares  and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on operations  increase debt service obligations  limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants  potentially negatively affect our credit ratings  and limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy 
we continue to asses our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash to reduce existing debt or repurchase ordinary shares 
in connection with our non foreign asset backed securitization program  we regularly sell a designated pool of trade accounts receivable to a wholly owned subsidiary  which in turn sells of the eligible receivables to conduits  administered by unaffiliated financial institutions 
this wholly owned subsidiary is a separate bankruptcy remote entity and its assets would be available first to satisfy the creditor claims of the conduits 
as the receivables sold are collected  the wholly owned subsidiary is able to sell additional receivables up to the maximum permitted amount under the program 
net cash proceeds of million are available at any one time under the securitization program 
prior to september   the transactions in this program were accounted for as sales under applicable accounting guidance 
effective september   we adopted new accounting guidance that resulted in more stringent conditions for reporting the transfer of a financial asset as a sale 
as a result of the adoption of this new guidance  the accounts receivable transferred under this program no longer qualified for sale treatment and as such were accounted for as secured borrowings 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  this program was amended which resulted in the transfers of the applicable accounts receivable again being accounted for as sales 
under the amended program any portion of the purchase price for the receivables which 
table of contents is not paid in cash upon the sale taking place is recorded as a deferred purchase price receivable  which is paid by the conduits from available cash as payments on the receivables are collected 
the securitization program requires compliance with several financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio and debt to ebitda ratio  as defined in the securitization agreements 
the program was amended on october  to  among other things  extend the program to october  and adjust pricing to reflect current market conditions 
net receivables sold under this program are excluded from trade accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the wholly owned subsidiary is assessed i a fee on the unused portion of the program of per annum based on the average daily unused aggregate receivables sold during the period  ii a usage fee on the utilized portion of the program equal to per annum inclusive of the unused fee on the average daily outstanding aggregate receivables sold during the immediately preceding calendar month and iii a fee on the weighted average amount outstanding under the program during the period multiplied by the applicable rate in effect for the period ie commercial paper rate 
the securitization conduits and the investors in the conduits have no recourse to our assets for failure of debtors to pay when due 
we continue to service the receivables sold and in exchange receive a servicing fee 
servicing fees recognized during fiscal year and were not material and are included in other expense within the consolidated statements of operations 
we do not record a servicing asset or liability as we estimate the fee we receive in return for our obligation to service these receivables is at fair value 
we sold billion  billion and billion of eligible trade accounts receivable during fiscal years  and  respectively 
in exchange  we received cash proceeds of billion  billion and billion during fiscal years  and  respectively  and a net deferred purchase price receivable at august  or a retained interest at august  and 
at august   the deferred purchase price receivable totaled approximately million  which was recorded initially at fair value as prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
at august  and  we retained an interest in the receivables of million and million  respectively 
the deferred purchase price receivable was valued using unobservable inputs level inputs  primarily discounted cash flows  and due to its credit quality and short term maturity  the fair value approximated book value 
we recognized pretax losses on the sales of receivables of approximately million  million and million during fiscal year  and  respectively  which are recorded to other expense within the consolidated statements of operations 
prior to execution of the previously discussed amendment  we recognized interest expense of approximately million during the first quarter of fiscal year associated with the secured borrowings 
see note trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs and note new accounting guidance to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our non foreign asset backed securitization program  at august   we had sold million of eligible trade accounts receivable  which represents the face amount of total outstanding receivables at that date 
in exchange  we received cash proceeds of million  and a net deferred purchase price receivable 
at august   the deferred purchase price receivable totaled approximately million 
in connection with our foreign asset backed securitization program  prior to the amendment during the third quarter of fiscal year  certain of our foreign subsidiaries sold  on an ongoing basis  an undivided interest in designated pools of trade accounts receivable to a special purpose entity  which in turn borrowed up to million from an unaffiliated financial institution and granted a security interest in the accounts receivable as collateral for the borrowings 
the securitization program was accounted for as a borrowing 
the loan balance was calculated based on the terms of the securitization program agreements 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  the securitization program was amended to provide for the sale of of our designated trade accounts receivable of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the special purpose entity which in turn sells of the receivables to an unaffiliated financial institution 
the special purpose entity is a separate bankruptcy remote entity and its assets would be available first to satisfy the creditor claims of the unaffiliated financial institution 
net cash proceeds of million are available at any one time under the amended securitization program 
transfers of the receivables to the unaffiliated financial institution are accounted for as sales 
under the amended program  any portion of the purchase price for the receivables which is not paid in cash to the special purpose entity upon the sale taking place is recorded as a deferred purchase price receivable  which is paid to the special purpose entity as payments on the receivables are collected 
the foreign asset backed securitization program requires compliance with several covenants including limitations on certain corporate actions such as mergers and consolidations 
the securitization agreement  as amended during the third quarter of fiscal year  expires on may  as we have the power to direct the activities of the special purpose entity and the obligation to absorb the majority of the expected losses or the right to receive benefits from the transfer of trade accounts receivable into the special purpose entity  we are deemed the primary beneficiary 
accordingly  we consolidate the special purpose entity which was also the case prior to the amendment during the third quarter of fiscal year 
net receivables sold under this program are excluded from trade accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the special purpose entity is assessed i a fee in an amount equal to per annum multiplied by the maximum aggregate invested amount during the period and ii a fee on the average amount outstanding under the program during the period multiplied by the applicable rate in effect for the period ie libor for ie dollars  euribor for euros and wibor for polish zlotys plus a per annum margin 
the unaffiliated financial institution has no recourse to our assets for failure of debtors to pay when due 
we continue servicing the receivables in the program and in exchange receive a servicing fee 
servicing fees recognized during fiscal years and were not material and are included in interest expense up through the amendment that occurred in the third quarter of fiscal year  and 
table of contents are included in other expense within the consolidated statements of operations subsequent to the amendment 
we do not record a servicing asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets as we estimate the fee we receive in return for its obligation to service these receivables is at fair value 
subsequent to the amendment that occurred in the third quarter of fiscal year  we sold including amounts transferred into the program on the amendment date million of eligible trade accounts receivable during fiscal year in exchange  we received cash proceeds of million during the same period  and a net deferred purchase price receivable 
at august   the deferred purchase price receivable totaled approximately million  which was recorded initially at fair value as prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
the deferred purchase price receivable was valued using unobservable inputs level inputs  primarily discounted cash flows  and due to its credit quality and short term maturity the fair value approximated book value 
the resulting losses on the sales of the receivables  subsequent to the amendment that occurred in the third quarter of fiscal year  were million during fiscal year  and were recorded to other expense within the consolidated statements of operations 
prior to execution of the previously discussed amendment  we recognized interest expense of approximately million during fiscal year associated with the secured borrowings 
at august   we had million of secured borrowings outstanding under the program

in connection with our foreign asset backed securitization program  at august   we had sold million of eligible trade accounts receivable  which represents the face amount of total outstanding receivables at that date 
in exchange  we received cash proceeds of million  and a net deferred purchase price receivable 
at august   the deferred purchase price receivable totaled approximately million 
in connection with a factoring agreement  we transfer ownership of eligible trade accounts receivable of a foreign subsidiary without recourse to a third party purchaser in exchange for cash 
the factoring of trade accounts receivable under this agreement is accounted for as a sale 
proceeds from the transfer reflect the face value of the account less a discount 
the discount is recorded as a loss to other expense within the consolidated statements of operations in the period of the sale 
in october  the factoring agreement was extended through march   at which time it is expected to automatically renew for an additional six month period 
the receivables sold pursuant to this factoring agreement are excluded from trade accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows

the sale programs have been amended to increase the facility limits from million to million and from million to million of specific trade accounts receivable at any one time

the credit facilities are denominated in us dollars 
the credit facilities incur interest at fixed and variable rates ranging from to

table of contents december  some or all of the lenders under the amended and restated credit facility and their affiliates have various other relationships with us and our subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services  including cash management  loans  letter of credit and bank guarantee facilities  investment banking and trust services 
we  along with some of our subsidiaries  have entered into foreign exchange contracts and other derivative arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates

interest and fees on the amended and restated credit facility advances are based on our non credit enhanced long term senior unsecured debt rating as determined by s p and moody s

in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we borrowed and repaid billion against the amended and restated credit facility under multiple draws 
a draw in the amount of million was made under the term portion of the old credit facility during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and the outstanding balance was repaid in full during the first quarter of fiscal year in addition to the loans described above  at august   we have loans outstanding to fund working capital needs 
these additional loans total approximately million and are denominated in euros 
the loans are due and payable within months and are classified as short term on our consolidated balance sheets 
f in the third quarter of fiscal year  we amended the foreign asset backed securitization program 
prior to execution of the amendment  we recognized interest expense of approximately million during fiscal year associated with the secured borrowings 
as a result of the amendment  the accounts receivable transferred under this program qualify for sale treatment and as such are no longer accounted for as secured borrowing

g this amount represents the fair value hedge accounting adjustment related to the senior notes 
for further discussion of our fair value hedges  see note derivative financial instruments and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements 
at august  and  we were in compliance with all covenants under the amended and restated credit facility and our securitization programs 
our working capital requirements and capital expenditures could continue to increase in order to support future expansions of our operations through construction of greenfield operations or acquisitions 
it is possible that future expansions may be significant and may require the payment of cash 
future liquidity needs will also depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory and shipments  changes in customer order volumes and timing of expenditures for new equipment 
for discussion of our cash management and risk management policies see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we currently anticipate that during the next months  our capital expenditures will be in the range of million to million  principally for machinery and equipment for new business  including new process technology within our dms segment  maintenance levels of machinery and equipment  information technology infrastructure upgrades and construction of a new greenfield facility 
we believe that our level of resources  which include cash on hand  available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities  additional proceeds available under our trade accounts receivable securitization programs and potentially available under our 
table of contents uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs and funds provided by operations  will be adequate to fund these capital expenditures  the payment of any declared quarterly dividends  the acquisition of telmar network technology  inc that was announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and our working capital requirements for the next months 
our million asset backed securitization program expires in october and our million foreign asset backed securitization program expires in may  and we may be unable to renew either of these 
our million uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale program was amended in the third quarter of fiscal year and our million uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale program was amended on july  the terms of the agreements were amended such that the programs no longer have defined termination dates and either party can elect to cancel the agreements by giving prior written notification to the other party of no less than days 
as the sales programs are uncommitted  we can offer no assurance that if we attempt to draw on such programs in the future that we will receive funding from the associated banks which would require us to utilize other available sources of liquidity  including our revolving credit facilities 
at august   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
as our growth remains predominantly outside of the united states  a significant portion of such cash and cash equivalents are held by our foreign subsidiaries 
we estimate that approximately million of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries could not be repatriated to the united states without potential income tax consequences 
in june  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of million of our common shares 
we repurchased  shares in the fourth quarter of fiscal year which is the full amount authorized by our board of directors 
should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities or undertake significant additional expansion activities  our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or access public or private debt and equity markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable 
see risk factors our amount of debt could significantly increase in the future 
our contractual obligations for short and long term debt arrangements  future interest on notes payable and long term debt  future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating lease arrangements  estimated future benefit payments to plan and capital commitments as of august  are summarized below 
we generally do not enter into non cancelable purchase orders for materials until we receive a corresponding purchase commitment from our customer

all derivative instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at their respective fair values 
at august   except for certain foreign currency contracts  with a notional amount outstanding of million and a fair value of million recorded in prepaid and other current assets and million recorded in accrued expenses  we have elected not to prepare and maintain the documentation required for the transactions to qualify as accounting hedges and  therefore  changes in fair value are recorded within our consolidated statements of operations 
the aggregate notional amount of outstanding contracts at august  that do not qualify as accounting hedges was million 
the fair value of these contracts amounted to a million asset recorded in prepaid and other current assets and a million liability recorded to accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheets 
the forward contracts both those that are designated as hedging instruments and those that are not will generally expire in less than four months  with months being the maximum term of the contracts outstanding at august  the change in fair value related to contracts designated as hedging instruments will be reflected in the revenue or expense line in which the underlying transaction occurs within our consolidated statements of operations

interest rate risk a portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our domestic investment portfolio 
we do not  and do not intend to  use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions 
we protect our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate these risks by generally investing in investment grade securities and by frequently positioning the portfolio to try to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository to levels below the credit ratings dictated by our investment policy 
the portfolio typically includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
at august   there were no significant outstanding investments 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we entered into a series of interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million designated as fair value hedges of a portion of our senior notes 
under these interest rate swaps  we received fixed rate interest payments and paid interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a spread 
the effect of these swaps was to convert fixed rate interest expense on a portion of the senior notes to floating rate interest expense 
gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were recorded to interest expense and offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying senior notes 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we terminated the interest rate swaps entered into in connection with the senior notes with a fair value adjustment of million  including accrued interest of million at august  the portion of the fair value that is not accrued is recorded as a hedge accounting adjustment to the carrying amount of the senior notes and is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the senior notes 
the effective interest rate for the senior notes includes the interest on the notes  the amortization of the hedge accounting adjustment and the accretion of the discount 
there were no amounts outstanding at august  we pay interest on several of our outstanding borrowings at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates 
there were million in borrowings outstanding under these facilities at august  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note notes payable and long term debt to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our outstanding debt obligations
