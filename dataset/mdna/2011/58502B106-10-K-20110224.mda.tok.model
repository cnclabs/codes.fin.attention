we may write off intangible assets  such as goodwill 
our intangible assets  which consist primarily of goodwill related to our acquisitions  are subject to annual impairment testing 
under current accounting standards  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and we may be subject to impairment losses as circumstances change after an acquisition 
if we record an impairment loss related to our goodwill  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the year in which the impairment is recorded 
we may not effectively manage our growth 
we have experienced rapid growth in our business and number of our employees and affiliated physicians in recent years which places significant demands on our financial  operational and management resources 

table of contents continued rapid growth may impair our ability to provide our services efficiently and to manage our employees adequately 
while we are taking steps to manage our growth  our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to do so effectively 
we may not be able to maintain effective and efficient information systems 
our operations are dependent on uninterrupted performance of our information systems 
failure to maintain reliable information systems  disruptions in our existing information systems or the implementation of new systems could cause disruptions in our business operations  including errors and delays in billings and collections  difficulty satisfying requirements under hospital contracts  disputes with patients and payors  violations of patient privacy and confidentiality requirements and other regulatory requirements  increased administrative expenses and other adverse consequences  any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our quarterly results will likely fluctuate from period to period 
we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly fluctuations in net patient service revenue and net income 
for example  we typically experience negative cash flow from operations in the first quarter of each year  principally as a result of bonus payments to affiliated physicians 
in addition  a significant number of our employees and associated professional contractors primarily affiliated physicians exceed the level of taxable wages for social security during the first and second quarters 
as a result  we incur a significantly higher payroll tax burden and our net income is lower during those quarters 
moreover  a lower number of calendar days are present in the first and second quarters of the year as compared to the remainder of the year 
because we provide services in the nicu on a hours a day basis  days a year  any reduction in service days will have a corresponding reduction in net patient service revenue 
we also have significant fixed operating costs  including costs for our affiliated physicians  and as a result  are highly dependent on patient volume and capacity utilization of our affiliated physicians to sustain profitability 
quarterly results may also be impacted by the timing of acquisitions and any fluctuation in patient volume 
as a result  our results of operations for any quarter are not indicative of results of operations for any future period or full fiscal year 
the value of our common stock may fluctuate 
there has been significant volatility in the market price of securities of healthcare companies generally that we believe in many cases has been unrelated to operating performance 
in addition  we believe that certain factors  such as legislative and regulatory developments  including announced regulatory investigations  quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated results of operations  lower revenues or earnings than those anticipated by securities analysts  and general economic and financial market conditions  could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
we may not be able to collect reimbursements for our services from third party payors in a timely manner 
a significant portion of our net patient service revenue is derived from reimbursements from various third party payors  including government sponsored healthcare plans  private insurance plans and managed care plans  for services provided by our affiliated professional contractors 
we are responsible for submitting reimbursement requests to these payors and collecting the reimbursements  and we assume the financial risks relating to uncollectible and delayed reimbursements 
in the current healthcare environment  payors continue their efforts to control expenditures for healthcare  including revisions to coverage and reimbursement policies 
due to the nature of our business and our participation in government and private reimbursement programs  we are involved from time to time in inquiries  reviews  audits and investigations by governmental agencies and private payors of our business practices  including assessments of our compliance with coding  billing and documentation requirements 
we may be required to repay these agencies or private payors if a finding is made that we were 
table of contents incorrectly reimbursed  or we may be subjected to pre payment reviews  which can be time consuming and result in non payment or delayed payment for the services we provide 
we may also experience difficulties in collecting reimbursements because third party payors may seek to reduce or delay reimbursements to which we are entitled for services that our affiliated physicians have provided 
if we are not reimbursed fully and in a timely manner for such services or there is a finding that we were incorrectly reimbursed  our revenue  cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  declining economic conditions could affect the timeliness and amounts received from our third party and government payors which would impact our short term liquidity needs 
hospitals may terminate their agreements with us  our physicians may lose the ability to provide services in hospitals or administrative fees paid to us by hospitals may be reduced 
our net patient service revenue is derived primarily from fee for service billings for patient care provided within hospital units by our affiliated physicians and from administrative fees paid to us by hospitals 
see item business relationships with our partners hospitals 
our hospital partners may cancel or not renew their contracts with us  reduce or eliminate our administrative fees in the future  or refuse to pay us our administrative fees if we fail to honor the terms of our agreement 
declining economic conditions could influence future actions of our hospital partners 
to the extent that our arrangements with our hospital partners are canceled  or are not renewed or replaced with other arrangements having at least as favorable terms  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  to the extent our affiliated physicians lose their privileges in hospitals or hospitals enter into arrangements with other physicians  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
hospitals could limit our ability to use our management information systems in our units by requiring us to use their own management information systems 
our management information systems  including babysteps are used to support our day to day operations and ongoing clinical research and business analysis 
if a hospital prohibits us from using our own management information systems  it may interrupt the efficient operation of our information systems which  in turn  may limit our ability to operate important aspects of our business  including billing and reimbursement as well as research and education initiatives 
this inability to use our management information systems at hospital locations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our industry is already competitive and could become more competitive 
the healthcare industry is highly competitive and subject to continual changes in the methods by which services are provided and the manner in which healthcare providers are selected and compensated 
because our operations consist primarily of physician services provided within hospital based units  we compete with other healthcare services companies and physician groups for contracts with hospitals to provide our services to patients 
we also face competition from hospitals themselves to provide our services 
companies in other healthcare industry segments  some of which have greater financial and other resources than ours  may become competitors in providing neonatal  maternal fetal  pediatric subspecialty care or anesthesia care 
we may not be able to continue to compete effectively in this industry  additional competitors may enter metropolitan areas where we operate  and this increased competition may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
unfavorable changes or conditions could occur in the states where our operations are concentrated 
a majority of our net patient service revenue in was generated by our operations in five states 
in particular  texas accounted for approximately of our net patient service revenue in see item business geographic coverage 
adverse changes or conditions affecting these particular states  such as 
table of contents healthcare reforms  changes in laws and regulations  reduced medicaid reimbursements and government investigations  economic conditions and natural disasters may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are dependent upon our key management personnel for our future success 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued contributions of our key management personnel  including our chief executive officer  roger j 
medel  md  for the management of our business and implementation of our business strategy 
the loss of dr 
medel or other key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 
provisions of our articles and bylaws could deter takeover attempts 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine the powers  preferences and rights of these shares without shareholder approval 
this preferred stock could be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to those of the holders of common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock under some circumstances could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control 
in addition  provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws  including those relating to calling shareholder meetings  taking action by written consent and other matters  could render it more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of mednax through a proxy contest or consent solicitation 
these provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for our shares of common stock

overview mednax is a leading provider of physician services including newborn  maternal fetal  pediatric subspecialty  and anesthesia care 
at december   our national network was composed of  affiliated physicians  including physicians who provide neonatal clinical care in states and puerto rico  primarily within hospital based neonatal intensive care units  to babies born prematurely or with medical complications 
we have affiliated physicians who provide maternal fetal and obstetrical medical care to expectant mothers experiencing complicated pregnancies primarily in areas where our affiliated neonatal physicians practice 
our network includes other pediatric subspecialists  including physicians providing pediatric cardiology care  physicians providing pediatric intensive care and physicians providing hospital based pediatric care 
in addition  we have physicians who provide anesthesia care to patients in connection with surgical and other procedures as well as pain management 
during the year ended december   we continued our expansion into anesthesia care with the acquisition of two established practices  bringing the number of anesthesia groups acquired since to six 
we also focused on the integration of previously acquired practices and the continuing development of the infrastructure to support those practices 
our national network of physicians and clinical professionals now includes anesthesiologists and advanced practice anesthetists who provide services in six metropolitan areas 
we continue to believe that there are additional opportunities to apply our administrative expertise in this practice area  and we intend to pursue the acquisition of additional anesthesia practices in in total  we completed the acquisition of physician group practices during the year ended december  these acquisitions consisted of eight neonatal practices  two maternal fetal medicine practices  one pediatric cardiology practice  two other pediatric practices  and two anesthesiology practices 
based on our experience  we expect that we can improve the results of these practices through improved managed care contracting  improved collections  identification of growth initiatives  as well as  operating and cost savings based upon the significant infrastructure that we have developed 
we have an unsecured million revolving credit facility line of credit that matures in the line of credit provides a funding source for future acquisitions  as well as other corporate purposes 
the line of credit is guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries and includes a million sub facility for the issuance of letters of credit and a million sub facility for swingline loans 
in addition  the line of credit may be increased to million subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions 
the united states is continuing to be affected by unfavorable economic conditions  and the number of unemployed workers remains significant 
during  our business continued to be affected by a shift toward a higher percentage of patient services being reimbursed under government sponsored healthcare programs 
if economic conditions do not improve or deteriorate further  there could be additional shifts toward government sponsored programs and patient volumes could decline 
in addition  many states are continuing to experience lower than anticipated revenue and are facing significant budget shortfalls 
these shortfalls could lead to reduced or delayed funding for state medicaid programs and  in turn  reduced or delayed reimbursement for physician services 
see item a  risk factors  in this form k for additional discussion on the general economic 
table of contents conditions in the united states and recent developments in the healthcare industry that could affect our business 
payments received from government sponsored programs are substantially less for equivalent services than payments received from commercial insurance payors 
in march  the patient protection and affordable care act  the healthcare reform act  was enacted 
the healthcare reform act contains a number of provisions that could affect us over the next several years 
these provisions include establishing health insurance exchanges to facilitate the purchase of qualified health plans  expanding medicaid eligibility  subsidizing insurance premiums and creating incentives for businesses to provide healthcare benefits 
other provisions contain changes to healthcare fraud and abuse laws and expand the scope of the federal false claims act 
many of the healthcare reform act s most significant reforms do not take effect until and thereafter  and their details will be shaped significantly by implementing regulations that have yet to be proposed 
moreover  enactment of the healthcare reform act has been controversial and has prompted numerous legal challenges to its constitutionality as well as efforts to modify or repeal the law now under consideration in congress 
as a result  we cannot predict with any assurance the ultimate effect of the healthcare reform act on our company  nor can we provide any assurance that its provisions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
geographic coverage during  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our net patient service revenue was generated by operations in our five largest states 
during  our five largest states consisted of texas  north carolina  georgia  florida  and washington 
during  our five largest states consisted of texas  georgia  florida  north carolina and virginia 
during  our five largest states consisted of texas  florida  georgia  virginia and arizona 
during  our concentration of net patient service revenue increased in north carolina and washington primarily as a result of physician practice acquisitions 
during  and  our operations in texas accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our net patient service revenue 
payor mix we bill payors for professional services provided by our affiliated physicians to our patients based upon rates for specific services provided 
our billed charges are substantially the same for all parties in a particular geographic area regardless of the party responsible for paying the bill for our services 
we determine our net patient service revenue based upon the difference between our gross fees for services and our estimated ultimate collections from payors 
net patient service revenue differs from gross fees due to i managed care payments at contracted rates  ii government sponsored healthcare program reimbursements at government established rates  iii various reimbursement plans and negotiated reimbursements from other third parties  and iv discounted and uncollectible accounts of private pay patients 
our payor mix is composed of contracted managed care  government  principally medicaid and medicare  other third parties and private pay patients 
we benefit from the fact that most of the medical services provided in the nicu are classified as emergency services  a category typically classified as a covered service by managed care payors 

table of contents the following is a summary of our payor mix  expressed as a percentage of net patient service revenue  exclusive of administrative fees  for the periods indicated years ended december  contracted managed care government other third parties private pay patients the payor mix shown in the table above is not necessarily representative of the amount of services provided to patients covered under these plans 
for example  the gross amount billed to patients covered under government programs for the years ended december   and represented approximately  and  respectively  of our total gross patient service revenue 
these percentages of gross revenue and the percentages of net revenue provided in the table above include the payor mix impact of acquisitions completed through december  on a same unit basis  however  the gross amount billed to patients covered under government programs for the years ended december   and represented approximately  and  respectively  of our total gross patient service revenue 
same units are those units at which we provided services for the entire current period and the entire comparable period 
the difference between the gross percentage billed to patients covered by government programs for the year ended december  from approximately  on a total company basis  and approximately  on a same unit basis  is due to the payor mix impact of acquisitions completed since december  these most recent acquisitions have a lower government payor mix percentage than the practices  taken as a whole  that comprised our business as of december  quarterly results we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly fluctuations in net patient service revenue and net income 
these fluctuations are primarily due to the following factors there are fewer calendar days in the first and second quarters of the year  as compared to the third and fourth quarters of the year 
because we provide services in nicus on a hours a day basis  days a year  any reduction in service days will have a corresponding reduction in net patient service revenue 
the majority of physician services provided by our office based and anesthesia practices consist of office visits and scheduled procedures that occur during business hours 
as a result  volumes at those practices fluctuate based on the number of business days in each calendar quarter 
a significant number of our employees and our associated professional contractors  primarily physicians  exceed the level of taxable wages for social security during the first and second quarters of the year 
as a result  we incur a significantly higher payroll tax burden and our net income is lower during those quarters 
we have significant fixed operating costs  including physician compensation  and  as a result  are highly dependent on patient volume and capacity utilization of our affiliated professional contractors to sustain profitability 
additionally  quarterly results may be affected by the timing of acquisitions and fluctuations in patient volume 
as a result  the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period or for the full year 
our quarterly results are presented in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our significant accounting policies  which are all in accordance with gaap 
certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements because their application requires management to make assumptions about future results and depends to a large extent on management s judgment  because past results have fluctuated and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
we believe that the application of the accounting policies described in the following paragraphs is highly dependent on critical estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and highly susceptible to change 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as estimated  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those discussed below 
revenue recognition we recognize patient service revenue at the time services are provided by our affiliated physicians 
almost all of our patient service revenue is reimbursed by government sponsored healthcare programs principally medicaid and third party insurance payors 
payments for services rendered to our patients are generally less than billed charges 
we monitor our revenue and receivables from these sources and record an estimated contractual allowance to properly account for the anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts 
accordingly  patient service revenue is presented net of an estimated provision for contractual adjustments and uncollectibles 
management estimates allowances for contractual adjustments and uncollectibles on accounts receivable based upon historical experience and other factors  including days sales outstanding dso for accounts receivable  evaluation of expected adjustments and delinquency rates  past adjustments and collection experience in relation to amounts billed  an aging of accounts receivable  current contract and reimbursement terms  changes in payor mix and other relevant information 
contractual adjustments result from the difference between the physician rates for services performed and the reimbursements by government sponsored healthcare programs and insurance companies for such services 
the evaluation of these historical and other factors involves complex  subjective judgments 
on a routine basis  we compare our cash collections to recorded net patient service revenue and evaluate our historical allowance for contractual adjustments and uncollectibles based upon the ultimate resolution of the accounts receivable balance 
these procedures are completed regularly in order to monitor our process of establishing appropriate reserves for contractual adjustments 
dso is one of the key factors that we use to evaluate the condition of our accounts receivable and the related allowances for contractual adjustments and uncollectibles 
dso reflects the timeliness of cash collections on billed revenue and the level of reserves on outstanding accounts receivable 
any significant change in our dso results in additional analyses of outstanding accounts receivable and the associated reserves 
we calculate our dso using a three month rolling average of net patient service revenue 
as of december   our dso was days 
we had approximately million in gross accounts receivable outstanding at december   and considering this outstanding balance  a one percentage point change in our estimated collection rate would result in an impact to net patient service revenue of approximately million 
our net patient service revenue  net income and operating cash flows may be materially and adversely affected if actual adjustments and uncollectibles exceed management s estimated provisions as a result of changes in these factors 
in addition  we are subject to audits of our billing by government sponsored healthcare programs and other third party payors 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in this form k 
professional liability coverage we maintain professional liability insurance policies with third party insurers on a claims made basis  subject to self insured retention  exclusions and other restrictions 
our self insured retention under our professional liability insurance program is maintained primarily through a wholly owned captive insurance 
table of contents subsidiary 
we record liabilities for self insured amounts and claims incurred but not reported based on an actuarial valuation using historical loss information  claim emergence patterns and various actuarial assumptions 
liabilities for claims incurred but not reported are not discounted 
our actuarial assumptions incorporate multiple complex methodologies to determine the best liability estimate for claims incurred but not reported and the future development of known claims  including methodologies that focus on industry trends  paid loss development  reported loss development and industry based expected pure premiums 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include the use of loss development factors to determine the future emergence of claim liabilities  the use of frequency and trend factors to estimate the impact of economic  judicial and social changes affecting claim costs  and assumptions regarding legal and other costs associated with the ultimate settlement of claims 
the key assumptions used in our actuarial valuations are subject to constant adjustments as a result of changes in our actual loss history and the movement of projected emergence patterns as claims develop 
the average lag period from the date a claim is reported to the date it reaches final settlement is approximately four years  although the facts and circumstances of individual claims could result in lag periods that vary from this average 
although we evaluate the need for professional liability insurance reserves in excess of amounts estimated in our actuarial valuations on a routine basis  our recorded reserves do not deviate significantly from the provided estimates 
because many factors can affect historical and future loss patterns  the determination of an appropriate professional liability reserve involves complex  subjective judgment  and actual results may vary significantly from estimates 
goodwill we record acquired assets  including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities at their respective fair values  recording to goodwill the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we test goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level on an annual basis 
the testing for impairment is completed using a two step test 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is performed to determine the amount of any impairment loss 
we use income and market based valuation approaches to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
these approaches focus on discounted cash flows and market multiples based on our market capitalization to derive the fair value of a reporting unit 
we also consider the economic outlook for the healthcare services industry and various other factors during the testing process  including hospital and physician contract changes  local market developments  changes in third party payor payments  and other publicly available information 
uncertain tax positions we account for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with the accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions 
this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
it also requires policy disclosures regarding penalties and interest and disclosures regarding increases and decreases in uncertain tax positions as a result of tax positions taken in a current or prior period  settlements with taxing authorities and any lapse of an applicable statute of limitations 
additional qualitative discussion is required for any tax position that may result in a significant increase or decrease in uncertain tax positions within a month period from our reporting date 
accounting for uncertain tax positions under this guidance requires significant judgment and analyses as well as assumptions about future events 
future changes to our analyses and assumptions related to uncertain tax positions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
other matters other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
for example  our consolidated financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis with our affiliated professional contractors because we or one of our subsidiaries have entered into management agreements with 
table of contents our affiliated professional contractors meeting the controlling financial interest criteria set forth in accounting guidance for consolidations 
our management agreements are further described in note to our consolidated financial statements in this form k 
the policies described in note often require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance and are frequently reexamined by accounting standards setters and regulators 
see new accounting pronouncements below for matters that may affect our accounting policies in the future 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain information related to our operations expressed as a percentage of our net patient service revenue patient billings net of contractual adjustments and uncollectibles  and including administrative fees years ended december  net patient service revenue operating expenses practice salaries and benefits practice supplies and other operating expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization total operating expenses income from operations other expense income  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income year ended december  as compared to year ended december  our net patient service revenue increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december   as compared to billion for the same period in of this million increase  million  or  was attributable to revenue generated from acquisitions completed after december  same unit net patient service revenue increased million  or  for the year ended december  the change in same unit net patient service revenue was the net result of increased revenue of approximately million  or  related to pricing and reimbursement factors and a net increase of million  or  from higher overall patient service volumes across our specialties 
the net increase in revenue of million related to pricing and reimbursement factors was primarily due to improved managed care contracting and the flow through of revenue from modest price increases  partially offset by a decrease in revenue caused by an increase in the percentage of our patients insured under government sponsored programs 
payments received from government sponsored programs are substantially less than payments received from commercial insurance payors for equivalent services 
the net increase in revenue of million from higher patient service volumes includes an increase of million from volume growth in our pediatric cardiology and anesthesiology services  partially offset by a decrease of million from volume declines in maternal fetal  neonatal and other services  including hearing screens and newborn nursery services 
same units are those units at which we provided services for the entire current period and the entire comparable period 
practice salaries and benefits increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for this million increase was primarily 
table of contents attributable to increased costs of million associated with new physicians and other staff to support acquisition related growth and growth at existing units  partially offset by decreases of million in professional liability costs related to favorable claims experience and incentive compensation based on physician practice operational results 
practice supplies and other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the increase was attributable to practice supply and other costs of million related to hospital based  hearing screen program and anesthesiology acquisitions 
in addition  rent  medical supply and other costs increased by million related to our office based acquisitions  and practice supply and other costs increased by million at our existing units 
general and administrative expenses include all billing and collection functions and all other salaries  benefits  supplies and operating expenses not specifically related to the day to day operations of our physician group practices 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for this increase of million is attributable to salaries  benefits and other general and administrative costs related to the overall growth of the company  partially offset by decreases in incentive compensation costs 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net patient service revenue decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for this increase was attributable to the amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions  accelerated amortization of approximately million related to the termination of a hospital contract associated with a prior acquisition and the depreciation of fixed asset additions 
income from operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for our operating margin was for the year ended december  and remained relatively the same when compared to for we recorded net interest expense of million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the increase in net interest expense was primarily due to accretion related to our contingent consideration liabilities combined with a lower rate of return on our investments  partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to lower average borrowings under our line of credit 
interest expense for the year ended december  and  consisted primarily of interest charges  commitment fees and amortized debt costs associated with our line of credit and accretion expense 
our effective income tax rate was for the year ended december   as compared to for the net decrease in our effective income tax rate is primarily related to a million reduction in our income tax provision during the third quarter of resulting from the resolution of certain matters that were under review with taxing authorities

our accounts receivable are principally due from managed care payors  government payors  and other third party insurance payors 
we track our collections from these sources  monitor the age of our accounts receivable  and make all reasonable efforts to collect outstanding accounts receivable through our systems  processes and personnel at our corporate and regional billing and collection offices 
we use customary collection practices  including the use of outside collection agencies  for accounts receivable due from private pay patients when appropriate 
almost all of our accounts receivable adjustments consist of contractual adjustments due to the difference between gross amounts billed and the amounts allowed by our payors 
any amounts written off related to private pay patients are based on the specific facts and circumstances related to each individual patient account 
days sales outstanding dso is one of the key factors that we use to evaluate the condition of our accounts receivable and the related allowances for contractual adjustments and uncollectibles

our cash flow from operating activities is significantly affected by the payment of physician incentive compensation 
a large majority of our affiliated physicians participate in our performance based incentive compensation program and almost all of the payments due under the program are made annually in the first quarter of each year 
as a result  we typically experience negative cash flow from operations in the first quarter of each year and fund our operations during this period with cash on hand or funds borrowed under our line of credit

see item a  risk factors  in this form k for more information on the risks associated with our line of credit 
at december   we had an outstanding principal balance of million on our line of credit 
we also had outstanding letters of credit associated with our professional liability insurance program of million which reduced the amount available on our line of credit to million at december  at december   we believe we were in compliance  in all material respects  with the financial covenants and other restrictions applicable to us under our line of credit 
based on our current expectations  we believe we will be in compliance with these covenants throughout the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock by employees participating in our stock purchase plans generated cash proceeds of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
because stock option exercises and purchases under these plans are dependent on several factors  including the market price of our common stock  we cannot predict the timing and amount of any future proceeds

our total liability related to professional liability risks at december  was million 

table of contents we anticipate that funds generated from operations  together with our current cash on hand and funds available under our line of credit  will be sufficient to finance our working capital requirements  fund anticipated acquisitions and capital expenditures  and meet our contractual obligations as described below for at least the next months 
during  we plan to invest approximately million in acquisitions within our neonatal  maternal fetal  pediatric cardiology and other pediatric subspecialties 
additionally  we plan to pursue acquisitions within the anesthesiology specialty  although the amount we plan to invest during has not been determined 
contractual obligations at december   we had certain obligations and commitments under our line of credit  capital leases and operating leases totaling approximately million as follows in thousands payments due obligation total and and and later line of credit capital leases operating leases amounts include interest payments at the applicable rate as of december  certain of our acquisition agreements contain contingent purchase price provisions based on volume and other performance measures 
potential payments under these provisions are not contingent upon the future employment of the sellers 
the amount of the payments due under these provisions cannot be determined until the specific targets or measures are attained 
in some cases  the sellers are eligible for annual payments over a three to five year period based on the growth in profitability of the physician practice 
as of december   payments of up to million may be due through under all other contingent purchase price provisions as follows in thousands at december   our total liability for uncertain tax positions was million 
the current portion of our total liability for uncertain tax positions was million at december  the timing and amount of future cash flows for each year beyond cannot be reasonably estimated
