item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed under item a risk factors in this annual report on form k 
the following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information  including our financial statements and the notes thereto  which appears elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading us metals service center with over years of experience 
our primary focus is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon  coated  aluminum and stainless flat rolled sheet  coil and plate products 
we act as an intermediary between metal producers and manufacturers that require processed metal for their operations 
we serve customers in most carbon steel consuming industries  including manufacturers and fabricators of transportation and material handling equipment  construction and farm machinery  storage tanks  environmental and energy generation equipment  automobiles  food service and electrical equipment  military vehicles and equipment  as well as general and plate fabricators and metals service centers 
we distribute our products primarily through a direct sales force 
we operate as a single reportable business segment with strategically located processing and distribution facilities in connecticut  georgia  illinois  iowa  kentucky  michigan  minnesota  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania  and washington 
in the third quarter of  we purchased our th facility for million  which is located in mt 
sterling  kentucky 
the facility is expected to become operational in the first quarter of our geographic footprint allows us to focus on regional customers and larger national and multi national accounts  primarily located throughout the midwestern  eastern and southern united states 
we sell a broad range of products  many of which have different gross profits and margins 
products that have more value added processing generally have a greater gross profit and higher margins 
accordingly  our overall gross profit is affected by  among other things  product mix  the amount of processing performed  the demand for and availability of metal and volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs 
we also perform toll processing of customer owned metal 
we sell certain products internationally  primarily in canada  mexico and puerto rico 
all international sales and payments are made in us dollars 
recent international sales have been immaterial to our consolidated financial results 
our results of operations are affected by numerous external factors including  but not limited to general and global business  economic  financial  banking and political conditions  competition  metal pricing  demand and availability  energy prices  pricing and availability of raw materials used in the production of metal  inventory held in the supply chain  customer demand for metal  customers ability to manage their credit line availability  and layoffs or work stoppages by our own  our suppliers or our customers personnel 
the metal industry also continues to be affected by global consolidation 
like many other service centers  we maintain substantial inventories of metal to accommodate the short lead times and just in time delivery requirements of our customers 
accordingly  we purchase metal in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon customer forecasts  historic buying practices  supply agreements with customers and market conditions 
our commitments to purchase metal are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders 
when metal prices increase  competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers 
to the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers  the net sales and profitability of our business could be adversely affected 
when metal prices decline  customer demands for lower prices and our competitors responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and  consequently  lower margins as we use existing inventory 
as selling prices declined in  our average selling prices fell below our average cost of inventory requiring us to recognize inventory lower of cost or market adjustments 
we were required under us generally accepted 
table of contents accounting principles to write down the value of our inventory to its net realizable value  less reasonable costs to transform the inventory into finished form  resulting in million of pre tax charges during due to the global economic crisis and the unprecedented drop in sales during  we took significant steps to reduce our operating expenses 
the cost reductions were achieved through various initiatives  including headcount reductions  elimination of temporary labor and overtime  reduced work hours to match depressed customer production schedules  company wide base pay reductions  the consolidation of our philadelphia facility into our other facilities  benefits reductions  and heightened control over all discretionary spending 
during  variable operating expenses increased related to increased shipments  sales and profits 
in order to meet increased customer production schedules  headcount  the use of temporary labor and overtime hours increased over in addition  during the end of the first and second quarters  we phased in restorations for pay originally reduced in the impact of the pay restorations was approximately thousand in at december   we employed approximately  people 
approximately of the hourly plant personnel at our detroit and minneapolis facilities are represented by three separate collective bargaining units 
a collective bargaining agreement covering our detroit workers expires august  a collective bargaining agreement covering our minneapolis plate facility workers expires march  a collective bargaining agreement covering our minneapolis coil facility workers expires september  we have never experienced a work stoppage and we believe that our relationship with employees is good 
however  any prolonged work stoppages by our personnel represented by collective bargaining units could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we monitor and evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
estimations are based upon the application of an historical collection rate to the outstanding accounts receivable balance  which remains fairly level from year to year  and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers  which can fluctuate significantly from year to year 
we cannot be certain that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience 
we consider all available information when assessing the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts each quarter 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include the costs of the purchased metal  internal and external processing and inbound freight 
cost is determined using the specific identification method 
we regularly review our inventory on hand and record provisions for obsolete and slow moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends 
changes in product demand and our customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand  which may require higher provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventory 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets and the related estimated remaining lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner or the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
we record an impairment or change in useful life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed 
income taxes deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet include  as an offset to the estimated temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts on the consolidated balance sheets  the tax effect of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
if we determine that we will not be able to fully realize a deferred tax asset  we will record a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax asset to its net realizable value 
revenue recognition for both direct and toll shipments  revenue is recognized when metal is shipped to the customer and title and risk of loss is transferred  which generally occurs upon delivery to our customers 
given the proximity of our customers to our facilities  substantially all of our sales are shipped and received within one day 
sales returns and allowances are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on historical experience and current estimates and are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement data for the years ended december   and dollars shown in thousands of net of net of net sales sales sales net sales gross profit a operating expenses b operating income loss a gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold which includes  of inventory lower of cost or market adjustments in 
b operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold 
compared to tons sold increased to thousand in from thousand in tons sold in included thousand from direct sales and thousand from toll processing  compared with thousand direct tons and thousand toll tons in tons sold in were higher in substantially all of our markets compared to in  tons sold were significantly depressed due to the impact of the global economic crisis 
we expect our tons sold in to increase over levels as the economic recovery continues 
net sales increased to million in from million in the increase in sales was due to increase in shipments and higher selling prices in than average selling prices increased in to per ton  compared with per ton in during the fourth quarter of  metal producers began significantly increasing metal prices  which has continued into the first quarter of as a result  
table of contents we believe that our first quarter average selling prices and net sales will be higher than the fourth quarter of as a percentage of net sales  gross profit as defined in footnote a in the table above increased to in from in the gross profit results included million of inventory lower of cost or market adjustments recorded at the end of the first and second quarters 
in  our gross profit margins were impacted by a larger percentage of sales made to the lower margin automotive industry  and increased sales of stainless steel and aluminum  which carries a lower gross profit percentage than carbon products 
we also  in certain instances  increased sales volume in at lower margins in order to gain market share in a recovering economy 
we expect our gross profit in the first quarter of to improve over the fourth quarter of operating expenses in increased million  or  from as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses decreased to in from in as a result of the increased sales 
during  variable operating expenses such as distribution and selling costs increased as a result of increased shipment levels 
in order to meet increased customer production schedules  headcount  the use of temporary labor and overtime hours all increased 
in addition  during the end of the first and second quarters of  we phased in base pay restorations originally reduced in the impact of the pay restorations was approximately million 
operating expenses for also included a one time charge of million of bad debt expense related to a customer that unexpectedly ceased operations in the third quarter 
this charge was included in the caption selling on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
during  thousand related to unamortized bank fees under our former revolving credit facility was expensed and included in the caption administrative and general on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
increased depreciation expense is associated with the capitalization of our new business system and other completed capital projects 
interest and other expense on debt totaled million in compared to million in our effective borrowing rate  exclusive of deferred financing fees and commitment fees  was in compared to in the increase in interest and other expense on debt in was primarily attributable to higher interest rates in the first half of prior to our refinancing 
for  income before income taxes totaled million compared to a loss before income taxes of million in an income tax provision of was recorded for  compared to an income tax benefit of for the majority of the tax benefit from represents the tax effect of operating losses that were carried back to prior years  resulting in a cash refund of million received in april the increase of five percentage points in our effective income tax rate was due to the impact of permanent non deductible tax items applied to a low pre tax income level  and the inability to take certain tax deductions once our taxable income turned to a taxable loss in the fourth quarter 
income taxes refunded  net of income taxes paid  during and  respectively  totaled million and million 
net income for totaled million or per basic and diluted share  compared to a net loss of million or per basic and diluted share for compared to tons sold decreased to thousand in from million in tons sold in included thousand from direct sales and thousand from toll processing  compared with million direct tons and thousand toll tons in tons sold in were significantly lower to all markets we sell  compared to  due to recessionary pressures and unprecedented crises in global financial markets 
many of our large original equipment manufacturers had numerous plant closings and significant reductions in their production schedules during net sales decreased to million in from billion in the decrease in sales was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes and a decline in average selling prices due to recessionary pressures  the ongoing global economic crisis  the liquidation of inventory at metals service centers and less value added sales 
average selling prices declined in to per ton  compared with  per ton in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit  including the inventory lower of cost or market adjustment  decreased to in from in the the price of metal purchased from metal producers began to rapidly 
table of contents decrease in late third quarter of at the same time  customer demand began to decrease significantly due to the ongoing global economic crisis  which resulted in lower overall selling prices 
this condition continued during the fourth quarter of and first half of our average cost of goods sold  as a percentage of sales  increased during these periods as we sold metal we acquired on earlier dates at higher prices 
the higher cost of goods sold  combined with lower selling prices  resulted in decreased gross profits 
as selling prices further declined in the first half of  our average selling prices fell below our average cost of inventory  resulting in inventory lower of cost or market adjustments 
we were required to write down the value of our inventory to its net realizable value average selling price less reasonable costs to complete the inventory into finished form  resulting in a million pre tax charge at the end of the first quarter of selling prices continued to decline during the second quarter of  resulting in an additional million inventory lower of cost or market pre tax adjustment at june  inventory lower of cost or market adjustments reduced the carrying value of the inventory on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the corresponding expense was recorded through the cost of materials sold on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
due to the ongoing global economic crisis and the unprecedented drop in sales  we took significant steps to reduce our operating expenses in operating expenses in decreased million or from lower operating expenses in were primarily attributable to decreased levels of variable incentive compensation associated with lower levels of profitability the majority of which was recorded in general and administrative operating expense captions  with a portion also recorded in the warehouse and processing and selling expense captions  decreased distribution expense resulting from reduced shipping levels recorded in the distribution expense caption and decreased warehouse and processing expense associated with lower shipping levels 
additional cost reductions were achieved through various initiatives  including headcount reductions of from peak levels  elimination of temporary labor and overtime  reduced work hours to match depressed customer production schedules  company wide base pay reductions ranging from to  including cash compensation reductions taken by our executive management team equal to of each executive s base salary  a cash compensation reduction of our board of directors fees  the consolidation of our philadelphia operations into our other facilities  benefits reductions and heightened control over all discretionary spending 
interest and other expense on debt totaled million in compared to million in our effective borrowing rate  exclusive of deferred financing fees and commitment fees  was in compared to in the increase in interest and other expense on debt was primarily attributable to higher overall borrowing levels during the first nine months of the year  higher amortization of financing fees related the amendments of our former revolving credit facility and lower amounts of interest capitalized into long term projects 
during  we incurred a total of million of interest and other expense on debt  of which million was recorded as expense on the consolidated statement of operations and million which was capitalized into long term projects 
in april and july  as a result of deteriorating market conditions and our inventory lower of cost or market adjustments  we obtained amendments to modify certain financial covenants contained in our former revolving credit facility 
interest and other expense on debt includes fees associated with the amendments of our former revolving credit facility  which are being amortized through june as part of the amendments  our average cost of borrowings has increased from approximately to 
we entered with no borrowings outstanding 
for  loss before income taxes totaled million compared to net income before taxes of million in an income tax benefit of was recorded for  compared to a tax provision of for the majority of the losses were carried back to prior years  resulting in a million income tax refund that was received in income taxes refunded  net of income taxes paid  during totaled million  compared to million of income taxes paid during net loss for totaled million or per basic and diluted share  compared to net income of million or per diluted share for liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs  purchasing  upgrading and acquiring processing equipment and facilities and other businesses  making acquisitions and paying dividends 

table of contents we use cash generated from operations  leasing transactions and borrowings under our credit facility to fund these requirements 
we believe that funds available under our credit facility  lease arrangement proceeds and the sale of equity or debt securities  together with funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide us with the liquidity necessary to fund anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditure requirements  our dividend payments and any business acquisitions over at least the next months 
in the future  we may as part of our business strategy  acquire and dispose of other companies in the same or complementary lines of business  or enter into or exit strategic alliances and joint ventures 
accordingly  the timing and size of our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise 
compared to working capital at december  totaled million  a million increase from december  the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in accounts receivable resulting from higher sales volumes and sales prices and a million increase in inventories  partially offset by a million decrease in income taxes receivable and deferred  a million increase in accounts payable associated with higher metal prices and increased metal receipts and a million increase in accrued expenses primarily associated with higher incentives and compensation 
during  we used million of net cash for operations  of which million was generated from operations and million was used for working capital 
in  we spent million on capital expenditures 
the expenditures were primarily attributable to the purchase of our mt 
sterling  kentucky facility  the down payment on our new temper mill in gary  indiana  additional processing equipment at our existing facilities and continued investments in our new business systems 
in  we expect to spend approximately million to million for capital expenditures  primarily related to the new temper mill in the indiana facility  and processing equipment for the kentucky facility 
we continue to successfully implement our new business systems 
during  we expensed million and capitalized million associated with the implementation of our new information systems 
since the project began in  we have expensed million and capitalized million associated with the new information systems 
in march  we began depreciating the portions of the new information systems that were placed in service at that time 
in  we generated million from financing activities  which primarily consisted of million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in february  our board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of per share  which is payable on march  to shareholders of record as of march  our board previously approved regular quarterly dividends of per share  which were paid on each of march   june   september  and december  dividend distributions in the future are subject to the availability of cash  the million annual limitation on cash dividends under our abl facility  as defined below  and continuing determination by our board of directors that the payment of dividends remains in the best interest of our shareholders 
on june   we entered into a new asset based revolving credit facility the abl facility 
the abl facility provides for a revolving credit line of million which may be increased up to million subject to the company obtaining commitments for such increase 
borrowings are limited to the lesser of a borrowing base  comprised of eligible receivables and inventories  or million in the aggregate 
the abl facility matures on june  the abl facility requires us to comply with various covenants  the most significant of which include i until maturity of the abl facility  if any commitments or obligations are outstanding and our availability is less than the greater of million or of the aggregate amount of revolver commitments  then we must maintain a ratio of ebitda minus certain capital expenditures and cash taxes paid to fixed charges of at least to for the most recent twelve fiscal month period  ii limitations on dividend payments  iii restrictions on additional

as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants under the abl facility and had approximately million of availability 
substantially higher steel prices in the first quarter of will result in increased working capital levels 
additionally  we expect to spend approximately million to million for capital expenditures  primarily related to the new temper mill in the indiana facility  and processing equipment for the kentucky facility 
we believe that funds available under the abl facility including its million accordion feature and lease arrangement proceeds  together with funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide us with the liquidity necessary to fund anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditure requirements  and our dividend payments over at least the next months 
in the future  we may  as part of our business strategy  acquire companies or assets in the same or complementary lines of business  or enter into and exit strategic alliances and joint ventures 
we intend to finance any acquisitions with either cash  cash generated from operations  borrowings under available credit facilities  proceeds from debt or equity offerings and or the issuance of common stock 
accordingly  the timing and size of our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise 
compared to working capital at december  totaled million  a million decrease from december  the decrease was primarily attributable to a million reduction in accounts receivable resulting from lower sales volumes and sales prices and a million reduction in inventories inclusive of million of inventory lower of cost or market adjustments  partially offset by a million increase in income taxes receivable and deferred  a million reduction in accounts payable associated with lower metal prices and reduced metal purchases and a million reduction in accrued expenses primarily associated with lower incentives and compensation 
during  we generated million of net cash from operations  of which million was used to fund losses and million was generated from working capital reductions 
in  we spent million on capital expenditures

our board of directors approved regular quarterly dividends of   and per share  which were paid on march   june   september  and december   respectively 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table reflects our contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations less than more than amounts in thousands total year years years years long term debt obligations a     unrecognized tax positions b   other long term liabilities c   operating leases d     total contractual obligations a see note to the consolidated financial statements 
includes debt balance and future interest obligations on debt at current interest rates 
b see note to the consolidated financial statements 
classification is based on expected settlement dates and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations 
c primarily consists of accrued bonuses  retirement liabilities and deferred compensation payable in future years 
d see note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has a made guarantees  b a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  c any obligation under certain derivative instruments or d any obligation under a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to a company  or engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development services within a company 
other than operating leases  as of december   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements 
effects of inflation inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits  transportation services  processing equipment  purchased metal  energy and borrowings under our credit facility 
general inflation  excluding increases in the price of metal and increased distribution expense  has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past three years 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued guidance now codified as fasb asc topic  subsequent events 
this guidance establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the new guidance under fasb asc topic is effective for interim or annual periods ending after june  the adoption of the new guidance under fasb asc topic did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the past several years  the base price of carbon flat rolled steel has fluctuated significantly and rapidly 
we witnessed unprecedented metal producer price increases during followed by rapid and steep metal price declines during rapidly declining prices  as we experienced during  reduced our gross profit margin percentages to levels that were lower than our historical levels  and resulted in inventory lower of cost or market adjustments 
higher inventory levels held by us  other service centers or end use customers could cause competitive pressures that could also reduce gross profit 
lower raw material costs for metal producers could result in customer demands for lower cost product  resulting in lower selling prices 
higher raw material costs for metal producers could cause the price of metal to increase 
rising prices result in higher working capital requirements for us and our 
table of contents customers 
some customers may not have sufficient credit lines or liquidity to absorb significant increases in the price of metal 
while we have generally been successful in the past in passing on producers price increases and surcharges to our customers  there is no guarantee that we will be able to pass on price increases to our customers in the future 
declining metal prices have generally adversely affected our net sales and net income  while increasing metal prices have generally favorably affected our net sales and net income 
approximately of our net sales in were directly to automotive manufacturers or manufacturers of automotive components and parts 
the automotive industry experiences significant fluctuations in demand based on numerous factors such as general economic conditions and consumer confidence 
the automotive industry is also subject  from time to time  to labor work stoppages 
the domestic automotive industry  which has experienced a number of recent bankruptcies  is emerging from significant restructuring 
inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits  transportation services  processing equipment  energy and borrowings under our abl facility 
general inflation  excluding increases in the price of steel and increased distribution expense  has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past three years 
we are exposed to the impact of fluctuating steel prices and interest rate changes 
during  we entered into nickel swaps at the request of our customers 
while these derivatives are intended to be effective in helping us manage risk  they have not been designated as hedging instruments 
for certain customers  we enter into contractual relationships that entitle us to pass through the economic effect of trading positions that we take with other third parties on our customers behalf 
the primary risk associated with the nickel swaps is the ability of our customer to honor its agreement with us related to derivative instruments 
if the customer is unable to honor its agreement  our risk of loss is the fair value of the nickel swap 
our primary interest rate risk exposure results from variable rate debt 
if interest rates in the future were to increase basis points from december  rates and  assuming no change in total debt from december  levels  the additional annual interest expense to us would be approximately thousand 
the fair value of fixed rate debt is subject to interest rate risk  credit risk and foreign currency risk 
we have not entered into any interest rate hedge transactions for speculative purposes or otherwise 
however  we do have the option to enter into to day fixed base rate euro loans under the abl facility
