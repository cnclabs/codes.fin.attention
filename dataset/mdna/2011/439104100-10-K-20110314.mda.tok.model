see page of this annual report for information regarding our use of forward looking statements in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this annual report 
overview as discussed in greater detail in item business  we currently engage in several service lines that are managed as one division the health information division 
our health information division hid consists of the following service lines portamedic performs paramedical and medical examinations of individuals  primarily on behalf of insurance companies in connection with the offering or rating of insurance coverage mainly life insurance  along with medical examinations of health plan participants in order to provide medical information on plan members to the plan sponsors  heritage labs performs tests of blood  urine and oral fluid specimens  primarily generated in connection with the paramedical exams and wellness screenings performed by our portamedic and health wellness service lines  and assembles and sells specimen collection kits  health wellness collects health information via onsite biometric screenings  self collection laboratory test kits and health risk assessments for health management companies  including wellness companies  disease management organizations and health plans  and hooper holmes services provides telephone interviews of insurance candidates  retrieval of medical records and inspections  risk management solutions and underwriting services for simplified issue products and products requiring full underwriting 
our core portamedic paramedical examination business accounted for approximately   and of our total consolidated revenues in  and  respectively 
basis of presentation of management s discussion and analysis on june   we sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our ced operating segment for million and received cash payments totaling million and a million note receivable due in six equal monthly installments beginning july  we recognized a net gain on the sale of the ced of approximately million for the year ended december  in connection with the sale of mdg on october   we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain pre closing tax liabilities 
as of december   we had recorded a liability totaling million relating to these pre closing tax obligations of mdg 
in  we recorded an additional reserve of million in loss on sale of subsidiaries 
our decision to sell the ced and mdg was based on several factors  including their limited ability to significantly contribute to our long term specific goals 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further discussion of our sale of the ced and mdg 
except where specific discussion of the ced and mdg is made  our discussion of our results of operations and financial condition excludes the ced and mdg for all periods presented 
highlights and business outlook for consolidated financial performance for the year ended december   consolidated revenues totaled million  representing a decline of approximately from the prior year 
our revenues continued to decline in primarily due to a weak economy and its negative impact on the customers we serve ie  the life insurance industry 
in addition  several of our large customers experienced a reduction in their business during due to a change in the pricing or design of their life insurance products 
our gross margin declined approximately basis points to primarily due to the year over year revenue decline in our portamedic service line 
we reduced our selling  general and administrative expenses to million  representing a reduction of million  or approximately from the prior year 
we generated income from continuing operations of million for the year ended december   which included restructuring and other charges of approximately million and a gain of million representing the reversal of a reserve previously established for interest and penalties associated with a state unclaimed property matter for which the audit period has lapsed 
this represents an improvement from our approximate break even prior year results  which included restructuring and other charges of approximately million and an income tax recovery of million 
business outlook for on november   we held a conference call with shareholders to discuss third quarter financial results and our business outlook 
at that time  we emphasized that our future success depended upon increasing sales and investing to improve operations in our priorities will include improving our processes and organization structure  and focusing on customer channels including brokers  direct marketers  insurance agents  examiners  and healthcare companies 
new senior managerial talent has been brought in to the company to strengthen business performance 
ransom j 
parker was appointed president and ceo in september mr 
parker is a senior executive  director  and private equity investor with considerable experience in operations and management  sales and marketing  and healthcare technology 
in january  lori gorman was appointed chief operations officer 
in the prior year  ms 
gorman demonstrated success in improving operational performance and reducing costs in three of the company service lines 
in january  anthony mendicino was appointed senior vice president for risk assessment sales  a newly created position responsible for the sale of all products and services to the insurance industry 
mr 
mendicino joined the company from siemens medical solutions usa  a leading provider of software and medical equipment to the healthcare industry 
in  we will continue to invest in new systems such as the deployment of our iparamed e exam  along with a new website to simplify customer ordering and tracking 
we will invest in our employees  both new and existing  through strategic hiring and pay for performance plans that will enable us to attract and retain talented employees 
although we will be investing in targeted initiatives to improve revenue  we will continue to manage our costs efficiently  as we have demonstrated the ability to do in past years 
we believe the impact of these investments will become apparent in  as demonstrated by a reduced rate of revenue decline  while positioning the company for sustained growth and profitability in portamedic for the year ended december   portamedic revenues decreased approximately in comparison to the prior year 
we continue to believe that achieving acceptable profitability levels will require top line revenue growth  and reversing past revenue declines 
although we have contracts or billing approvals with over of the insurance carriers in the marketplace  the number of paramedical examinations we complete on life insurance applicants continued to decline 
the rate of decline in completed examinations for the full year was compared to  with a decline in compared to in order to reverse our decline in completed examinations  we are taking steps to achieve greater sales success with local agents  brokers  direct marketers and insurance carriers 
the general market for portamedic services has steadily declined 
for example  according to limra  a life insurance industry research organization  there were approximately million applications for life insurance completed in the united states in  compared to approximately million applications in the us life insurance application index maintained by mib solutions  a life insurance industry research organization  declined for compared to notwithstanding these declines  we believe that the market continues to offer attractive opportunities to a company that can sell its services effectively and distinguish itself from its competitors 
we have taken the following steps to increase our market share and improve top line revenue in early  we instituted sales leadership changes which are expected to positively impact our portamedic service line 
as noted previously  anthony mendicino has been appointed senior vice president for risk assessment sales and is responsible for the sale of all products and services to our insurance industry customers 
in addition  we are taking steps to strengthen our national and local sales forces  including recruiting experienced sales leaders and improving sales training 
in  we introduced iparamed  a new technology platform that improves underwriting accuracy and requires only one touch with an applicant 
the iparamed platform delivers a complete  digital case file for any life insurance applicant  sending structured data into our customers underwriting or workflow systems 
we believe iparamed will help our customers place more business faster  and has the potential to significantly reduce our customers total cost of underwriting 
in  we deployed iparamed equipped netbooks to portamedic branch offices in states 
we expect this rollout to continue in we have implemented operational improvements that have reduced the average amount of time required to complete an insurance exam 
we have extended the weekday hours of operation of portamedic dallas based managed scheduling center to pm eastern time  and saturday until pm we developed and introduced instant scheduling  a service which is being utilized by many local producers 
as a result of these and other changes  we estimate that portamedic average time to schedule and complete an insurance exam is two to four calendar days faster than in  giving portamedic a speed advantage that is important to local producers 
in  we introduced new  one stop services for customers who bring most insurance products to market brokers  direct marketing organizations  broker dealers  and producer groups 
our national service center in allentown  pennsylvania now gives these customers a single point of contact for application quality assurance  case management service  application packet processes  and custom work flow processes 
in  we began the design of a new website  integrated with our back end operations  to make it easier for portamedic customers to enter orders and track order status 
we believe that this web site will increase customer satisfaction 
we expect to deploy this new website to our portamedic customers in the first quarter of  and eventually to extend this website to facilitate the ordering and status of all of our risk assessment services 
in an effort to improve the speed  accuracy and consistency of services provided to our portamedic customers  we decided in december to begin the development of a new it system for processing customer orders 
based on our current project timetable  this system is scheduled for completion during the fourth quarter of and is now expected to cost million  including implementation costs 
this represents a change in our previously estimated completion date march  and is attributable to a longer than planned development cycle  additional testing and validation of the new system  and incorporation of additional specifications and features to better meet customer needs 
we believe this new it system will enhance the quality of service to our customers  while improving productivity and decreasing future cash outlay 
we successfully completed our second annual sas type ii engagement  a third party review of our it processes and procedures for handling customer data 
we believe this review gives customers confidence in our information controls  information security and technology management processes 
we upgraded branch telephone systems to voice over ip  using our secure backbone network for voice communication 
we believe this will result in decreased future cash outlay for communications and increased customer satisfaction through faster response to calls 
although the number of paramedical examinations portamedic performs continues to decline  we believe that we are a market leader in the industry 
we also believe that the steps we are taking to improve our selling ability  and the quality and speed of our services  will enable us to reduce the rate of decline experienced in the last several years 
however  life insurance market conditions in are expected to remain challenging according to a survey of industry leaders conducted by limra in early december  of insurance executives believe overall individual life insurance sales will remain flat in heritage labs for the year ended december   heritage labs revenues decreased to million from million in the comparable prior year period 
in  we tested  specimens  compared to  specimens in  a decrease of 
revenues from lab kit assembly decreased in compared to heritage labs services consist principally of performing tests of blood  urine and oral fluid specimens and the assembly and sale of kits used in the collection and transportation of such specimens to its lab facility 
in  approximately of heritage labs revenue came from lab testing and came from the sale of specimen kits 
most of heritage labs revenue originates from paramedical exam companies including portamedic  and therefore heritage labs is affected by the same negative market trends affecting portamedic  namely the decline in the number of life insurance applications 
in response  heritage labs has taken the following steps to expand its market share and increase revenues in june  heritage labs announced a collaboration with mib solutions to help insurers better evaluate excess mortality risk in their book of new business 
by incorporating specifically identified laboratory results from heritage labs  mib solutions is able to provide clearer insights into business exceptions and risk concentrations across every risk class to help fine tune underwriting performance 
we believe this will be the first of several collaborative efforts between heritage labs and mib solutions to help insurers better manage mortality risk  and believe this will lead to increased lab testing business 
we have developed a risk score methodology to help our insurance clients better understand the mortality implications between and among interactions of multiple tests related to specific disease states 
we believe that the mortality data we are providing is unique and more complex than the data being provided by our competitors 
we continue to use sophisticated data modeling to gain a better understanding of the true mortality consequences of the laboratory tests that we provide to the insurance industry 
our objective has been to assist our clients in their ability to develop new insurance products and establish more accurate premium rating or pricing techniques using the lab mortality data that we have developed 
we believe we will be able to leverage the value of the data we supply to gain new business 
heritage labs received a certificate of registration on may  and is now an iso registered company 
the certification means that heritage labs has passed all of the audit requirements and is officially recognized as being a provider of medical devices and related services that consistently meet customer and regulatory requirements 
the certification also means that heritage labs has developed  implemented and maintained a quality management system that focuses on providing safe and effective medical devices 
iso is currently recognized by the european union  the united states  canada  japan  and taiwan  among others 
heritage labs is marketing a line of self collected finger stick blood test kits directly to customers which are used to test hemoglobin ac 
the hemoglobin ac test is particularly important for diabetics  who should regularly monitor their hemoglobin ac levels 
heritage labs uses two blood testing methods for hemoglobin ac  one for testing whole blood specimens and the other for testing dried blood spots 
the test kits are currently available in retail locations nationwide 
while we intend for these measures to increase our market share and revenues  there can be no assurance we will achieve those results 
we believe that  as a result of the initiatives noted above  along with portamedic revenue improvements  we may achieve future growth at heritage labs 
health wellness our health wellness service line  established in  recorded revenues of approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or approximately  from the prior year 
in  we performed approximately  health screenings and sold approximately  home specimen collection kits 
in  we performed approximately  screenings and sold approximately  home specimen collection kits 
we provided our services to health management companies in  up from companies in we have conducted screening events in every state in the us as well as the district of columbia and puerto rico 
currently we have approximately  wellness certified examiners within our network of examiners 
health wellness services include event scheduling  provision and fulfillment of all supplies eg  examination kits  blood pressure cuffs  stadiometers  scales  centrifuges  lab coats  bandages  etc 
at screening events  event management  biometric screenings height  weight  body mass index  hip  waist  neck  pulse  blood pressure  blood draws via venipuncture or finger stick  lab testing  participant and aggregate reporting  data processing and data transmission 
heritage labs does all of the testing on the venipuncture samples we collect at health and wellness screenings 
our key market advantage is our ability to screen both individuals and groups in every jurisdiction in the us using a variety of screening methods 
we marked a number of milestones in our health wellness business in in march  we were named vendor of the year by healthways  inc  a leading provider of health improvement solutions to employers  in recognition of the high level of participant satisfaction delivered by hooper holmes 
in april  we announced diabetes know now  a health awareness platform to combat diabetes which combines an online risk assessment and at home diabetes test kit assembled and sold by heritage labs 
we believe diabetes know now is a novel and efficient way to target diabetes screenings 
diabetes know now improves the efficiency and effectiveness of our customers programs by only completing blood tests on targeted groups that are at the highest risk for diabetes 
in october  we introduced hooper holmes onsite sm  a face to face  on premises health coaching service for work locations with any number of employees 
the service is delivered by specially trained health champions many of whom are physical therapists  personal trainers and nutritionists 
we believe onsite is an important addition to our service line because it better enables our customers to deliver behavior change and motivation 
we believe that we are well positioned to capture a significant share of the health and care management market 
however  the success of health wellness will depend in part upon the yet to be proven success of our health and care management initiatives 
if the return on investment in these initiatives is not sufficiently high  our health wellness business may not reach its full potential 
notwithstanding  we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity given our company s unique set of assets  including heritage labs  our proprietary health wellness it system  and our network of certified examiners 
hooper holmes services for the year ended december   hooper holmes services revenues decreased in comparison to the prior year 
a significant contributing factor to this decrease was reduced tele underwriting interviewing service revenues from several of our largest insurance company customers 
these customers experienced a substantial slowdown in their business reduced insurance applications which resulted in fewer tele interviews 
also significantly contributing to the decrease in hooper holmes services revenue is a decline in our attending physician statement aps retrieval revenue as compared to this decline is attributable to the overall decrease in life insurance application activity 
throughout  we implemented cost reduction actions to bring expenses in line with our reduced revenues 
these actions included a significant reduction of staff  along with several branch office closures 
key financial and other metrics monitored by management in our periodic reports filed with the sec  we provide certain financial information and metrics about our businesses  and information that our management uses in evaluating our performance and financial condition 
our objective in providing this information is to help our shareholders and investors generally understand our overall performance and assess the profitability of our businesses and our prospects for future net cash flows 
in  we primarily focused on tracking our actual results relative to our forecasts and budgets  and measuring the degree of success of our efforts to align our costs with lower revenue levels 
we monitored the following metrics in the number of paramedical examinations performed by portamedic  the average revenue per paramedical examination  time service performance  from examination order to completion  the mib life index data  which represents an indicator of the level of life insurance application activity and limra a life insurance industry research organization which tracks the number of completed life insurance applications  the number of health screenings completed by our health wellness business  the number of tele interviewing underwriting reports we generate  the number of specimens tested by heritage labs  the average revenue per specimen tested  budget to actual performance at the branch level as well as in the aggregate  and customer and product line profitability 
certain of the above cited metrics are discussed in the comparative discussion and analysis of our results of operations that follows

the reduction in the number of paramedical examinations and related services performed in and is due to the continued decline in life insurance application activity in the united states as reported by the mib life index  along with a weak us economy and its negative impact on the market for life insurance products 
also  several of our large customers experienced a reduction in their business during due to a change in the pricing and design of their life insurance products

revenues from lab kit assembly approximately of total heritage labs revenue in decreased by in comparison to this decrease is primarily attributable to reduced demand from one large customer  along with fewer kit orders from portamedic due to their revenue decline

this customer generated approximately million in revenues for heritage labs in decreased revenues due to the loss of this customer were partially offset by revenue earned from new customers in the lab testing and kit manufacturing businesses 
the decreased average revenue per specimen experienced in the year ended december  was primarily due to a reduction in the amount we charged our customers resulting from a reduction in overnight delivery costs incurred by us and passed on to our customers 
to a lesser extent  product mix also contributed to the decrease in average revenue per specimen for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year

this percentage increase is largely due to portamedic revenues declining at a rate greater than its associated costs 
a significant percentage of costs associated with our portamedic business are fixed and therefore did not decrease as revenue declined 
the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for portamedic was offset by declines in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for heritage labs and hooper holmes services  resulting from revenue levels decreasing at a rate greater than cost reduction initiatives implemented during and the decrease in our cost of operations for the year ended december  compared to was primarily attributable to lower cost of operations in our portamedic and heritage labs businesses attributable to reduced revenue levels and cost reduction initiatives implemented as revenues declined

the sg a expense reductions listed above were partially offset by the following expense increases depreciation expense non cash resulting from a reduction in the estimated useful life of our current it systems originally scheduled to be replaced in mid  totaling million  and consulting costs associated with retaining the services of a strategic advisor in totaling million 
impairment of long lived assets intangible assets in accordance with current accounting standards  long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  are to be tested for impairment when impairment indicators are present 
as a result of the decline in revenues during  and  principally due to the downturn in the economy and its negative impact on the life insurance industry in which we serve  we performed an impairment analysis of our intangible assets 
based on our analysis  we concluded that the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by our intangible assets primarily customer relationships exceeded their carrying values 
as a result  no impairment was recorded on our intangible assets during  and restructuring and other charges for the year ended december   we recorded restructuring charges of million 
these charges are attributable to severance related to the resignation of our former ceo and employee severance costs related to headcount reduction actions in portamedic and hooper holmes services 
for the year ended december   we recorded restructuring and other charges of million 
these charges were attributable to restructuring charges for employee severance and office closures totaling million  and legal and other costs related to the board of director election proxy contest totaling million

included in the results for the year ended december  is a gain of approximately million representing the reversal of a reserve previously established for interest and penalties associated with a state unclaimed property matter for which the audit period has lapsed 
income taxes we have significant deferred tax assets attributable to tax deductible intangibles  capital loss carryforwards and federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  which may reduce taxable income in future periods 
based on the continued decline in revenues  the cumulative tax and operating losses  the lack of taxes in the carryback period and the uncertainty surrounding the extent or timing of future taxable income  we do not believe we will realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we continue to record a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the income tax expense recorded in the year ended december   including interest  is primarily due to an accrual for amended tax returns filed in one state for tax years and  and the true up of the tax provision for that state 
prior to the passage of the worker  homeownership and business assistance act of the act  signed into law in the fourth quarter of  corporations were allowed to carryback net operating losses two years and forward years to offset taxable income 
under the act  corporations can elect to carryback net operating losses incurred in either or to a profitable fifth year preceding the loss year 
the net operating loss carried back is limited to of the available taxable income for that year 
we were able to carryback approximately million of federal net operating losses incurred in to tax year and in the fourth quarter of  we filed an amended tax return to recover approximately million of federal income tax previously paid 
in february  we received million of cash related to the carryback claim  which included million of interest 
the federal tax benefit recorded in the year ended december  reflected the utilization of fully reserved net operating losses that were carried back to under the act referred to above  offset by certain state tax liabilities 
the income tax expense recorded in the year ended december  reflected certain state tax liabilities 
as of december  and  no amounts were recorded for unrecognized tax benefits or for the payment of interest or penalties 
furthermore  no such amounts were accrued during the years ended december  and in july  we received notification from the us internal revenue service the irs that it had completed its audits of our tax returns for the years through with no adjustments 
state income tax returns for the year and forward are subject to examination

in connection with the sale of mdg on october   we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain pre closing tax liabilities 
in  information became available to us relating to certain pre closing tax obligations of mdg 
based on this information  we recorded a reserve of million in loss on sale of subsidiaries 
in the first quarter of  we increased this reserve by million resulting in a total liability for these pre closing tax matters of million as of march  on may   we reached a settlement agreement with medicals direct holding limited md successor in interest to the purchaser of mdg whereby we agreed with md to fully release and discharge each other from any and all claims known or unknown under the mdg stock purchase agreement and the tax deed executed on october  on may   we paid md the sum of million  and further released md from the additional purchase price payments due us  totaling million 
the million payment is presented within cash used in provided by operating activities of discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  net income loss net income for the year ended december  was million  or per share on both a basic and diluted basis  compared to our essentially break even results for the year ended december  in  we reported a net loss of million  or per share

our net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
revolving credit facility as of december  and for the majority of the first quarter of  we had a three year revolving credit facility the credit facility with citicapital commercial corporation citicapital 
the credit facility was due to expire on october  during each of the years and  we incurred unused fees of million and million  respectively  under the credit facility with citicapital 
on march   we entered into a three year loan and security agreement loan and security agreement with td bank  na td bank which  pursuant to the first amendment and modification to loan and security agreement first amendment executed on december   now expires on march  see note to the consolidated financial statements

in addition  under the first amendment  the maturity date of the loan and security agreement has been extended by one year to march  from march   and commencing march  and at all times thereafter the unused line fee usage fee under the loan and security agreement has been reduced from one percent per annum to one half of one percent per annum  in each case on the difference between million and the sum of the average outstanding principal balance of cash advances under the revolving credit line and the average daily aggregate undrawn portion of all outstanding letters of credit for the preceding month 
the first amendment also adjusts the applicable interest rate provisions under the loan and security agreement such that commencing march  and at all times thereafter the terms libor market index rate and libor rate shall each be defined without regard to a one percent per annum minimum 
the first amendment also contains other customary representations  warranties  covenants and terms and conditions

under the second amendment  the maximum aggregate future purchase money indebtedness and capitalized lease obligations of the company in respect of specific items of equipment was increased to million from million effective december  the second amendment also contains other customary representations  warranties  covenants and terms and conditions 
the loan and security agreement provides us with a revolving line of credit  the proceeds of which are to be used for general working capital purposes 
under the terms of the loan and security agreement  td bank has agreed to make revolving credit loans to us in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding which  when combined with the aggregate undrawn amount of all unexpired letters of credit  does not exceed of eligible receivables as that term is defined in the loan and security agreement  provided that in no event can the aggregate amount of the revolving credit loans and letters of credit outstanding at any time exceed million

during each of the years and  we incurred unused line fees of million 
in addition  we are required to pay an annual loan fee of million 
as security for our full and timely payment and other obligations under the loan and security agreement  we granted td bank a security interest in all of our existing and after acquired property and of our subsidiary guarantors  including our receivables which are subject to a lockbox account arrangement  inventory and equipment 
as further security  we have granted td bank a mortgage lien encumbering our corporate headquarters 
in addition  the obligations are secured under the terms of security agreements and guarantees provided by all of our subsidiaries 
the aforementioned security interest and mortgage lien are collectively referred to herein as the collateral 
pursuant to the terms of the loan and security agreement  td bank  in its sole discretion based upon its reasonable credit judgment  may a establish and change reserves required against eligible receivables  b change the advance rate against eligible receivables or the fair market value of our corporate headquarters  and c impose additional restrictions on the standards of eligibility for eligible receivables  any of which could reduce the aggregate amount of indebtedness that may be incurred under the loan and security agreement 
the loan and security agreement contains covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability  and that of our subsidiaries  to pay any dividends or distributions on  or redeem or retire any shares of any class of our capital stock or other equity interests  incur additional indebtedness  sell or otherwise dispose of any of our assets  other than in the ordinary course of business  create liens on our assets  enter into any sale and leaseback transactions  and enter into transactions with any of our affiliates on other than an arm length or no less favorable basis 
the loan and security agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the loan and security agreement  measured on a trailing month basis  of no less than to as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters 
the fixed charge coverage ratio allows for the exclusion of unfinanced capital expenditures of up to million from the denominator of the calculation provided we maintain pre defined minimum cash balances at td bank on average for the days ended as of the measurement date 
as of december   our average cash balance at td bank for the days then ended  exceeded the pre defined cash balance requirements  thereby allowing all unfinanced capital expenditures to be excluded from the denominator of the fixed charge coverage ratio calculation 
as of december   our fixed charge coverage ratio measured on a trailing month period and excluding capital expenditures in excess of one dollar was to and  as such  we satisfied the financial covenant 
however  there is no assurance that we will satisfy this financial covenant as the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter 
on april   we obtained from td bank and issued a letter of credit under the loan and security agreement in the amount of million to the landlord of our heritage labs facility as security for performance of our obligations under the lease 
the letter of credit will automatically extend for additional periods of one year  unless notice is given to terminate the letter of credit days prior to its expiration date 
in no event shall the letter of credit be renewed beyond december  also  in december  we opened a million td visa credit card account to be used by hooper holmes services medical records retrieval service line 
the letter of credit and the credit card reduced our borrowing capacity under our revolving line of credit 
as of december   our borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit totaled million 
the failure of us or any subsidiary guarantor to comply with any of the covenants or the breach of any of our representations and warranties contained in the loan and security agreement constitutes an event of default under that agreement 
in addition  the loan and security agreement provides that events of default include the occurrence or failure of any event or condition that  in td bank sole judgment  could have a material adverse effect i on our business  operations  assets  management  liabilities or condition  ii on the value of or the perfection or priority of td bank lien upon the collateral  or iii on the ability of us and our subsidiary guarantors to perform under the loan and security agreement 
the revolving credit loans are payable in full  together with all accrued and unpaid interest  on the earlier of march  as amended or the date of termination of the loan commitments  termination being one of the actions td bank may take upon the occurrence of an event of default 
we may prepay any revolving credit loan  in whole or in part without penalty 
we may also terminate the loan and security agreement  provided that on the date of such termination all of our obligations thereunder are paid in full 
we will be required to pay an early termination fee equal to million if the termination occurs prior to march   and million if termination occurs thereafter 
based on our anticipated level of future revenues  the cost reduction initiatives implemented to date  our existing cash and cash equivalents and unused borrowing capacity  we believe we have sufficient funds to meet our cash needs through december  cash flows from operating activities for the years ended december   and  net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million  million and million  respectively

our consolidated days sales outstanding dso  measured on a rolling day basis was days at december   compared to days at december  historically  our accounts receivable balances and our dso are at their lowest point in december as many of our customers utilize the remainder of their operating budgets before their year end budget close out 
as a result  our dso historically declines at year end compared to other months during the year 
our average dso for was days compared to days in we believe our increased collection efforts in  along with our continued focus on electronic customer billing  are the primary drivers of our improvement in our dso relative to our historic experience

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
share repurchases we did not purchase any shares of our common stock during  or dividends no dividends were paid in  or we are precluded from declaring or making any dividend payments or other distributions of assets with respect to any class of our equity securities under the terms of the loan and security agreement with td bank

critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is important to the portrayal of a company s operating results and or financial condition and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base these determinations upon the best information available to us during the period in which we are accounting for our results 
our estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions within and beyond our control change or as further information becomes available 
further  these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
changes in our estimates are recorded in the period the change occurs 
we have identified the accounting policies discussed below as critical to us 
the discussion below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for paramedical and medical examinations when the examination of the insurance policy applicant is completed 
revenues generated from medical record collection  laboratory testing  fingerstick test kits and other services are recognized when the related service is completed 
in all cases  there must be evidence of an agreement with the customer  the sales price must be fixed or determinable  delivery of services must occur and the ability to collect must be reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for i estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  and ii estimated amounts that customers may deduct from their remittances to us for billed items not in compliance with customer specifications 
management regularly assesses the financial condition of our customers  the markets in which these customers participate as well as historical trends relating to customer deductions and adjusts the allowance for doubtful accounts based on this review 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  our ability to collect on accounts receivable could be negatively impacted  in which case additional allowances may be required 
we must make significant management judgments and estimates in determining allowances for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
one significant uncertainty inherent in our analysis is whether our past experience will be indicative of future periods 
adverse changes in general economic conditions could affect our allowance estimates  collection of accounts receivable  cash flows and results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets  including intangible assets and assets to be disposed long lived assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment is a condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the following are examples of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of the long lived asset  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
the process to identify if there is impairment includes the following steps a comparison of the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the long lived assets or asset group to the carrying value of the long lived assets or asset group  and if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows  an impairment is identified 
the amount of the impairment is based on the excess of the carrying value of the long lived assets to its fair value 
we estimate the fair value of the long lived assets based on discounted cash flow models 
as discussed in the results of operations  due to the decline in revenues during  and  principally due to the downturn in the economy and its negative impact on the life insurance industry in which we serve  we performed an impairment analysis of our intangible assets 
based on the analysis  we concluded that the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by our intangible assets primarily customer relationships  exceeded their carrying values 
as a result  no impairment was recorded on our intangible assets during  and assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on the continued decline in revenues  the cumulative tax and operating losses  the lack of taxes in the carryback period and the uncertainty surrounding the extent or timing of future taxable income  we do not believe that we will realize the tax benefits of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we continue to record a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million federal tax benefit due to the utilization of fully reserved net operating losses that were carried back to under the worker  homeownership and business assistance act of  signed into law in the fourth quarter of share based compensation authoritative accounting literature addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
this literature establishes accounting principles which require companies to recognize compensation cost in an amount equal to the fair value of the share based payments  such as stock options or non vested stock granted to employees 
compensation cost for stock options and non vested stock is recognized over the vesting period based on the estimated fair value on the date of the grant 
the accounting principles also require that we estimate a forfeiture rate for all share based awards 
we monitor share option exercise and employee termination patterns to estimate forfeiture rates within the valuation model 
the estimated fair values of options are based on assumptions  including estimated lives  volatility  dividend yield  and risk free interest rates 
these estimates also consider the probability that the options will be exercised prior to the end of their contractual lives and the probability of termination or retirement of the holder  which are based on reasonable estimates and historical trends but are subject to change based on a variety of external factors 
recently issued accounting standards multiple element arrangements in september  new authoritative accounting literature became effective requiring that revenue be allocated to each unit of accounting in many multiple deliverable arrangements based on the relative selling price of each deliverable 
the literature also changed the level of evidence of standalone selling price required to separate deliverables by allowing a best estimate of the standalone selling price of deliverables when more objective evidence of selling price is not available 
this accounting principle is effective as of january  we do not expect the adoption of this accounting principle to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowing activities  which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
our credit facility is based on variable rates and is therefore subject to interest rate fluctuations 
accordingly  our interest expense will vary as a result of interest rate changes and the level of any outstanding borrowings 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding 
as of december   we have determined that there was no material market risk exposure to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of such date
