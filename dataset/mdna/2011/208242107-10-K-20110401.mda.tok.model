general we intend the following discussion and analysis to provide you with a better understanding of the financial condition and performance of our retail and credit segments for the indicated periods  including an analysis of those key factors that contributed to our financial condition and performance and that are  or are expected to be  the key drivers of our business 
through our retail stores  we provide products and services to our customers in seven primary market areas  including houston  san antonio austin  dallas fort worth  southern louisiana  southeast and south texas and oklahoma 
products and services offered through retail sales outlets include home appliances  consumer electronics  home office equipment  lawn and garden products  mattresses  furniture  repair service agreements  customer credit programs  including installment and revolving credit account programs  and various credit insurance products 
these activities are supported through our extensive service  warehouse and distribution system 
our stores bear the conn s name  after our founder s family  and deliver the same products and services to our customers 
all of our stores follow the same procedures and methods in managing their operations 
our management evaluates performance and allocates resources based on the operating results of its retail and credit segments 
the five cornerstones of our business which represent  in our view  the five components of our business model that drive profitability are strong merchandising systems  flexible credit options for our customers  extensive warehousing and distribution systems  service systems to support our customer s needs during and beyond the product warranty periods  and our uniquely  well trained employees in each area 
each of these systems combine to create a nuts and bolts support system for our customers needs and desires 
we derive the majority of our revenues from our product sales and repair service agreement commissions  which are generated by sales of third party and company obligor repair service agreements and product replacement policies 
however  unlike many of our competitors  we provide in house credit options for our customers product purchases 
additionally  we derive a portion of our revenues from the sale of credit insurance products of third party insurers to our customers 
in the last three years  we have financed  on average  approximately of our retail sales through our credit programs 
we offer our customers a choice financing through our installment payment and revolving credit plans 
in addition to interest bearing installment and revolving charge contracts  at times  we offer promotional credit programs to certain of our customers that provide for same as cash or deferred interest interest free periods of varying terms  generally three  six    and months  and require monthly payments beginning in the month after the sale 
in 
table of contents turn  we finance substantially all of our customer receivables from these credit options through our revolving credit facility and a second lien term loan 
in addition to our own credit programs  we use third party financing programs to provide a portion of the non interest bearing financing for purchases made by our customers 
we also use a third party provider to offer rent to own financing to our customers 
while our warehouse and distribution system does not directly generate revenues  other than the fees paid by our customers for delivery and installation of the products to their homes  it is our extra  value added program that our existing customers have come to rely on  and our new customers are hopefully sufficiently impressed with  to become repeat customers 
we derive revenues from our repair services on the products we sell 
additionally  acting as an agent for unaffiliated companies  we sell credit insurance to protect our customers from credit losses due to death  disability  involuntary unemployment and damage to or loss of the products they have purchased 
application of critical accounting policies in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
some of these accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates 
we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on authoritative pronouncements  historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis 
we could reasonably use different accounting estimates  and changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period  with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates 
we believe that the critical accounting estimates discussed below are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
customer accounts receivable 
customer accounts receivable are originated at the time of sale and delivery of the various products and services we offer 
we include the amount of principal and accrued interest on those receivables that are expected to be collected within the next twelve months  based on contractual terms  in current assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
those amounts expected to be collected after twelve months  based on contractual terms  are included in long term assets 
typically  a receivable is considered delinquent if a payment has not been received on the scheduled due date 
additionally  we offer reage programs to customers with past due balances that have experienced a financial hardship  if they meet the conditions of our reage policy 
reaging a customer s account can result in updating it from a delinquent status to a current status 
generally  an account that is delinquent more than days and for which no payment has been received in the past seven months will be charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts and interest accrued subsequent to the last payment will be reversed and charged to the allowance for uncollectible interest 
we have a secured interest in the merchandise financed by these receivables and therefore have the opportunity to recover a portion of any charged off amount 
interest income on customer accounts receivable 
interest income is accrued using the effective interest method for installment contracts  and the simple interest method for revolving charge accounts  and is reflected in finance charges and other 
typically  interest income is accrued until the contract or account is paid off or charged off and we provide an allowance for estimated uncollectible interest 
we typically only place accounts in non accrual status when legally required to do so 
interest accrual is resumed on those accounts once a legally mandated settlement arrangement is reached or other payment arrangements are made with the customer 
interest income is recognized on our interest free promotional accounts based on our historical experience related to customers who fail to satisfy the requirements of the interest free programs 
additionally  for sales on deferred interest and same as cash programs that exceed one year in duration  we discount the sales to their present value  resulting in a reduction in sales and receivables  and amortize the discount amount in to finance charges and other over the term of the program 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts  including estimated uncollectible interest  for our customer accounts receivable  based on our historical net loss experience and expectations for future losses 
the net charge off data used in computing the loss rate is reduced by the amount of post charge off recoveries received  including cash payments  and amounts realized from the repossession of the products financed and  at times  payments received under credit insurance policies 
additionally  we separately evaluate portions of the credit portfolio based on underwriting criteria to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts and uncollectible interest for customer receivables was million and million  at january   and  respectively 
additionally  as a result of our practice of reaging customer accounts  if the account is not ultimately collected  the timing and amount of the charge off is impacted 
if these accounts had been charged off sooner the historical net loss rates might have been higher 
reaged customer receivable balances represented of the total portfolio balance at january  if the loss rate used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts was increased by at january   we would have increased our provision for bad debts by approximately million for fiscal revenue recognition 
revenues from the sale of retail products are recognized at the time the customer takes possession of the product 
such revenues are recognized net of any adjustments for sales incentive offers such as discounts  coupons  rebates  or other free products or services and discounts of promotional credit sales that will extend beyond one year 
we sell repair service agreements and credit insurance contracts on behalf of unrelated third parties 
for contracts where the third parties are the obligors on the contract  commissions are recognized in revenues at the time of sale  and in the case of retrospective commissions  at the time that they are earned 
where we sell repair service renewal agreements in which we are deemed to be the obligor on the contract at the time of sale  revenue is recognized ratably  on a straight line basis  over the term of the repair service agreement 
these repair service agreements are renewal contracts that provide our customers protection against product repair costs arising after the expiration of the manufacturer s warranty and the third party obligor contracts 
additionally  the company sells repair service agreements on its furniture products at the point of sale for which it is the obligor at the time of the sale 
all of these agreements typically have terms ranging from to months 
these agreements are separate units of accounting and are valued based on the agreed upon retail selling price 
the amount of repair service agreement revenues deferred at january  and were million and million  respectively  and are included in deferred revenues and allowances in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the amounts of repair service agreement revenue recognized for the fiscal years ended january   and were million  million and million  respectively 
vendor allowances 
we receive funds from vendors for price protection  product rebates earned upon purchase or sale of product  marketing  training and promotion programs which are recorded on the accrual basis as a reduction to the related product cost  cost of goods sold  compensation expense or advertising expense  according to the nature of the program 
we accrue rebates based on the satisfaction of terms of the program and sales of qualifying products even though funds may not be received until the end of a quarter or year 
if the programs are related to product purchases  the allowances  credits or payments are recorded as a reduction of product cost  if the programs are related to product sales  the allowances  credits or payments are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold  if the programs are directly related to promotion  marketing or compensation expense paid related to the product  the allowances  credits  or payments are recorded as a reduction of the applicable expense in the period in which the expense is incurred 
we received million  million and million in vendor allowances during the fiscal years ended january   and  respectively  of which million  million and million  respectively  represented advertising assistance allowances 
the increase in fiscal year was due to increased use of instant rebates by vendors to drive sales 
over the past three years we have received funds from approximately vendors  with the terms of the programs ranging between one month and one year 
accounting for leases 
we analyze each lease  at its inception and any subsequent renewal  to determine whether it should be accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease 
additionally  monthly lease expense for each operating lease is calculated as the average of all payments required under the minimum lease term  including rent escalations 
generally  the minimum lease term begins with the date we take possession of the property and ends on the last day of the minimum lease term  and includes all rent holidays  but excludes renewal terms that are at our option 
any tenant improvement allowances received 
table of contents are deferred and amortized into income as a reduction of lease expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term 
the amortization of leasehold improvements is computed on a straight line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvements 
for transactions that qualify for treatment as a sale leaseback  any gain or loss is deferred and amortized as rent expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term 
any deferred gain would be included in deferred gain on sale of property and any deferred loss would be included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
year ended january  compared to the year ended january  executive overview this overview is intended to provide an executive level overview of our operations for our fiscal year ended january  our performance during fiscal was impacted by the slowdown in the economy and rising unemployment in our markets that occurred during the year 
following are significant financial items in management s view our revenues for the fiscal year ended january   decreased by  or million  from fiscal year  to million due primarily to a decline in product sales and related reduction in repair service agreement commissions 
sales declined during the year largely as a result of the slowdown in the economic conditions in our markets  and tighter credit underwriting standards implemented during the year to improve the credit quality of our customer receivable portfolio 
our same store sales declined in the fiscal year ended january   as compared to an decrease of for fiscal  with the sharpest decline occurring in the third quarter  when same store sales fell as compared to the third quarter of fiscal same store sales increased by in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the same quarter of fiscal finance charges and other decreased for the fiscal year ended january   when compared to the prior fiscal year  primarily due to a decrease in interest income and fees as the average interest income and fee yield earned on the portfolio fell from for the year ended january   to  for the year january   and the average balance of customer accounts receivable outstanding during the year ended january  fell  as compared to the prior year 
the interest income and fee yield fell as a result of the higher level of charge offs experienced  resulting in an increase in the reversal of accrued interest and increased reserves for uncollectible interest  and the reduced amount of new credit accounts originated in the year ended january   as compared to the prior fiscal year 
our gross margin  defined as total revenues less cost of goods and parts sold  was for fiscal  a increase from in fiscal  primarily as a result of retail gross margin increased from in the year ended january   to in fiscal year  which positively impacted the total gross margin by basis points 
the increased retail gross margin was partially offset by a million inventory write down related to a realignment of the company s track inventory product line 
the write down negatively impacted our retail gross margin by approximately basis points  and a change in the revenue mix in the year ended january   such that higher gross margin finance charge and other revenues contributed a lesser percentage of total revenues  partially offset by reduced revenue contribution from repair service agreement commissions  which contributed a smaller percentage of total revenues  and resulted in an decrease in the total gross margin of approximately basis points  during the fiscal year ended january   selling  general and administrative sg a expense decreased million  though it increased as a percent of revenues to from in the prior year period  primarily due to the deleveraging effect of the decline in total revenues 
the litigation reserve accrual recorded in the prior year period accounted for million of the change in sg a expense 
the remainder of the reduction in sg a expense was driven primarily by lower compensation and related expense  reduced depreciation expense and reduced property and casualty insurance expense 
these decreases were partially offset by increased expense from the increased use of contract delivery and installation services and increased advertising agency fees  during the fiscal year ended january   we determined  as a result of the sustained decline in our market capitalization  the increasingly challenging economic environment and its impact on our comparable store sales  
table of contents credit portfolio performance and operating results  that an interim goodwill impairment test was necessary 
a two step method was utilized for determining goodwill impairment 
our valuation was performed utilizing the services of outside valuation consultants using both an income approach utilizing our discounted debt free cash flows and comparable valuation multiples 
upon completion of the impairment test  we concluded that the carrying value of our recorded goodwill was impaired 
as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million to write off the carrying value of our goodwill during the three month period ended october   on march   the company s board of directors approved a plan that calls for the closing of five of the company s underperforming retail locations and allowing the leases to expire on two other locations that do not perform at a level the company expects for mature store locations 
the stores that are being closed have average annual retail revenues over the last three years of million as compared to an average of million for our other non clearance center locations  and typically have not contributed to the company s pretax income 
after the closures and lease expirations  the company will have a total of retail stores 
the store closings will all be in texas  with one being located in the san antonio market  two in the austin market and four in the dallas market 
based on the decision to close five store locations  in conjunction with the company s review of long lived assets for potential impairment  the company determined that it was appropriate to record an impairment charge of approximately million related to the long lived assets at the stores that are being closed 
during the past year we explored multiple opportunities in the capital markets to allow us to refinance our borrowing facilities 
as a result  we incurred expenses related to working with bankers  lawyers  accountants and other professional service providers to review and pursue the various alternatives presented 
given our decision to pursue the financing transactions that were completed in the fourth quarter  we wrote off the costs incurred related to financing alternatives considered  but not completed and the unamortized financing fees associated with the terminated securitization program  as we experienced an improvement in our credit portfolio performance specifically  the trends in the delinquency rate  payment rate and percent of the portfolio reaged since fiscal  the provision for bad debts decreased by million for the year ended january   from million in the prior year 
while our total net charge offs of customer and non customer accounts receivable increased by million compared to the prior fiscal year  due to the improvements mentioned above and the decline in the balance of our portfolio  our total allowance for bad debts declined approximately million during the year ended january   after absorbing the higher net charge offs incurred during the period  net interest expense increased in fiscal  by million or over prior year primarily due to increased amortization expense of million and million in fees paid to the lenders that provided the variable funding note under our terminated securitization facility 
interest expense was also impacted by the higher effective interest rate on our debt impacted by the higher interest rate on the term loan that was entered into in november  the provision for income taxes was negatively impacted by the effect of the taxes for the state of texas  which are based on gross margin  instead of income before taxes 
operational changes and outlook we have implemented  continued to focus on  or modified operating initiatives that we believe will positively impact future results  including reviewing our existing store locations to ensure the customer demographics and retail sales opportunity are sufficient to achieve our store performance expectations  and selectively closing or relocating stores to achieve those goals augmenting our credit offerings through the use of third party consumer credit providers to provide flexible financing options to meet the varying needs of our customers  while focusing the use of our credit program to offer credit to customers where third party programs are not available  and 
table of contents we currently plan to close five of our underperforming retail locations and allow the leases to expire on two other locations that do not perform at the level we expect for mature store locations 
the stores that are being closed have average annual retail revenues over the last three years of million as compared to an average of million our other non clearance center locations and typically have not contributed to our pretax income 
after the closures and lease expirations  we will have a total of retail stores 
the store closings will all be in texas  with one being located in the san antonio market  two in the austin market and four in the dallas market 
while we benefited from our operations being concentrated in the texas  louisiana and oklahoma region in the earlier months of  recent weakness in the national and state economies  including instability in the financial markets  declining consumer confidence and the volatility of oil prices  have and will present significant challenges to our operations in the coming quarters 
specifically  future sales volumes  gross profit margins and credit portfolio performance could be negatively impacted  and thus impact our overall profitability 
additionally  declines in our future operating performance could impact compliance with our credit facility covenants 
as a result  while we will strive to maintain our market share  improve credit portfolio performance and reduce expenses  we will also work to maintain our access to the liquidity necessary to maintain our operations through these challenging times

year ending january  change dollars in millions net sales finance charges and other revenues the million decrease in net sales was made up of the following a million decrease resulted from a same store sales decrease of a million increase generated by four retail locations that were not open for twelve consecutive months in each period 
two new locations were opened subsequent to february  and two of our clearance centers were closed subsequent to february   a million decrease resulted from a decrease in discounts on promotional credit sales  and a million decrease resulted from an decrease in service revenues 

table of contents the components of the million decrease in net sales were a million decrease in product sales and a million net decrease in repair service agreement commissions and service revenues 
the million decrease in product sales resulted from the following approximately million decrease attributable to an overall decrease in the average unit price 
the decrease was due primarily to declines in the average unit price in consumer electronics  furniture  bedding and track 
track saw the largest decline with a drop in the average unit price  and approximately million increase attributable to an overall increases in unit sales  due primarily to increases in furniture and track sales  partially offset by reduced sales of appliances and deliveries the million decrease in repair service agreement commissions and service revenues resulted primarily from the following a million decrease in the repair service agreement commissions of the retail segment due primarily to the decline in product sales  a million decrease in the repair service agreement commissions of the credit segment due to the higher level of credit charge offs experienced  and a million decrease in the service revenues of the retail segment due primarily to the increased use of third party servicers to provide timely product repairs to our customers 
the following table presents the makeup of net sales by product category in each period  including repair service agreement commissions and service revenues  expressed both in dollar amounts and as a percent of total net sales 
classification of sales has been adjusted from previous filings to ensure comparability between the categories 
year ended january  percent increase dollars in millions amount percent amount percent category consumer electronics home appliances track furniture and mattresses other total product sales repair service agreement commissions net service revenues total net sales this decrease is due to a decline in average selling prices on flat panel televisions and a decrease in total units sold 
the home appliance category declined due to lower unit sales across the category as the appliance market in general showed continued weakness 
the decrease in track sales consisting largely of computers  computer peripherals  video game equipment  portable electronics and small appliances is driven primarily by reduced sales of video game equipment  gps device  camera  camcorder and audio equipment sales 
sales from netbooks and desktop and laptop computers were down slightly as lower average selling prices offset a increase in unit sales of these products 
the growth in furniture and mattress sales was driven by the addition of in store specialists focused on this category  improved store displays and expanded product selection 
other category includes lawn and garden  delivery and other miscellaneous items 
lawn and garden sales increased while delivery revenues decreased on lower product sales volume 

table of contents the decline in repair service agreement commissions was driven largely by the decline in product sales and increased cancellations of these agreements as a result of higher credit charge offs

this decrease is due to the slower economic conditions in our markets in the last half of the fiscal year ended january  other category includes lawn and garden  delivery and other miscellaneous items 
this category declined primarily due to reduced generator sales as we benefited from an increase in sales of generators in the areas affected by the hurricanes in the prior fiscal year that impacted certain of our markets 
additionally  lower lawn and garden sales due to the drought conditions experienced in many of our markets impacted sales in this category 
the decline was also impacted by a reduction in the total number of deliveries due largely to the overall decline in sales 
the repair service agreement commissions decreased due to reduced emphasis on this product as a result of our monitoring of the program offered to consumers and the training of our sales associates  in response to the texas attorney general s litigation

impact of inflation and changing prices we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations 
however  price deflation  primarily in consumer electronics has impacted our net sales and results of operations 
a significant increase in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect our customers shopping decisions and patterns 
we rely heavily on our internal distribution system and our next day delivery policy to satisfy our customers needs and desires  and any such significant increases could result in increased distribution charges 
such increases may not affect our competitors in the same manner as it affects us 

table of contents seasonality and quarterly results of operations our business is somewhat seasonal  with a higher portion of sales and operating profit realized during the quarter that ends january  due primarily to the holiday selling season

liquidity and capital resources current activities we require capital to finance our growth as we add new stores and markets to our operations  which in turn requires additional working capital for increased customer receivables and inventory 
we have historically financed our operations through a combination of cash flow generated from earnings and external borrowings  including primarily bank debt  extended terms provided by our vendors for inventory purchases  acquisition of inventory under consignment arrangements and transfers of customer receivables to asset backed securitization facilities 
since we extend credit in connection with a large portion of our retail  repair service agreement and credit insurance sales  we enter into debt financing facilities to fund the customer receivables generated by the extension of credit 
on november   we completed the following financing transactions a million asset based loan facility that matures in november  
table of contents a million second lien term loan that matures in november  and a million subscription rights offering that resulted in the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock 
a portion of the net proceeds of the financing transactions was utilized to retire the balances outstanding under our asset backed securitization program and terminate the asset backed securitization borrowing facilities 
during fiscal  we expanded our asset based revolving credit facility  which provides funding based on a borrowing base calculation that includes customer accounts receivable and inventory  from million to million and extended the maturity date to november the credit facility bears interest at libor plus a spread ranging from basis points to basis points  based on a leverage ratio defined as total liabilities to tangible net worth 
in addition to the leverage ratio  the revolving credit facility includes a fixed charge coverage requirement  a minimum customer receivables cash recovery percentage requirement  a net capital expenditures limit and a minimum availability requirement 
with the expansion  certain of the covenants in the facility were changed and a minimum availability requirement was added 
the leverage ratio covenant requirement was changed from a required maximum of to to a required maximum of to 
the fixed charge coverage ratio was changed from a minimum of to to to 
there is also now a minimum required availability of million 
additionally  the agreement contains cross default provisions  such that  any default under another of our credit facilities would result in a default under this agreement  and any default under this agreement would result in a default under those agreements 
we expect  based on current facts and circumstances that we will be in compliance with the above covenants for the next months 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the asset based revolving credit facility at january   was  including the interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps 
we entered into a million second lien term loan  maturing in november  which limits the combined borrowings under our asset based revolving credit facility and the second lien term loan based on a borrowing base calculation that includes customer accounts receivable  inventory and real estate 
the loan bears interest at the greater of libor or  plus a spread of basis points  which resulted in an interest rate of at january  the agreement also contains certain prepayment penalties should we choose to prepay all or a portion of the term loan prior to its maturity date 
if a prepayment is made prior to the first anniversary date  we would be required to pay a prepayment premium equal to the greater of interest owed for the remainder of the first year or of the principal amount being paid 
prepayments made prior to the second  third and fourth anniversaries of the closing date of the loan would require prepayment premiums of  and of the principal amount being paid  respectively  for prepayments occurring prior to each of those dates 
the covenants under the term loan are consistent with the covenant requirement of the asset based revolving credit facility 
additionally  the agreement contains cross default provisions  such that  any default under another of our credit facilities would result in a default under this agreement  and any default under this agreement would result in a default under those agreements 
we expect  based on current facts and circumstances that we will be in compliance with the above covenants for the next months 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under all our credit facilities at january   was  including the interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps 
a summary of the significant financial covenants that govern our new credit facilities compared to our actual compliance status at january   is presented below actual required minimum maximum fixed charge coverage ratio must exceed required minimum to to total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio must be lower than required maximum to to cash recovery percentage must exceed stated amount capital expenditures  net must be lower than required maximum million million availability must be higher than the required minimum million million note all terms in the above table are defined by the revolving credit facility and term loan and may or may not agree directly to the financial statement captions in this document 
the covenants are calculated each month on a trailing twelve month basis  except for the cash recovery percentage  which is calculated on a trailing three month basis 
as of january   we had immediately available borrowing capacity of million under our asset based revolving credit facility  net of standby letters of credit issued  available to us for general corporate purposes before 
table of contents considering the million minimum availability requirement and extended vendor terms for purchases of inventory 
in addition to the million currently available under the revolving credit facility  an additional million may become available if we grow the balance of eligible customer receivables and total eligible inventory balances 
the principal payments received on customer receivables which averaged approximately million per month during the fiscal year ended january   are available each month to fund new customer receivables generated 
during fiscal  we expect to continue to reduce the balance of the credit portfolio 
we intend  at this time  to use the cash flow from collections of the receivables to reduce our outstanding debt balances  which will increase the unused capacity under our revolving facility available to fund future growth 
we will continue to finance our operations and future growth through a combination of cash flow generated from operations and external borrowings  including primarily bank debt  extended vendor terms for purchases of inventory and acquisition of inventory under consignment arrangements 
based on our current operating plans  we believe that cash generated from operations  available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan  extended vendor terms for purchases of inventory and acquisition of inventory under consignment arrangements will be sufficient to fund our operations  store expansion and updating activities and capital programs for at least the next months  subject to continued compliance with the covenants in our credit facilities 
additionally  if there is a default under any of the facilities that is not waived by the various lenders  it could result in the requirement to immediately begin repayment of all amounts owed under our credit facilities  as all of the facilities have cross default provisions that would result in default under all of the facilities if there is a default under any one of the facilities 
if the repayment of amounts owed under our credit facilities is accelerated for any reason  we may not have sufficient cash and liquid assets at such time to be able to immediately repay all the amounts owed under the facilities 
both the revolving credit facility and the term loan are significant factors relative to our ongoing liquidity and our ability to meet the cash needs associated with the growth of our business 
our inability to use either of these programs because of a failure to comply with their covenants would adversely affect our business operations 
funding of current and future customer receivables under the borrowing facilities can be adversely affected if we exceed certain predetermined levels of re aged customer receivables  write offs  bankruptcies or other ineligible customer receivable amounts 
there are several factors that could decrease cash available  including reduced demand or margins for our products  more stringent vendor terms on our inventory purchases  loss of ability to acquire inventory on consignment  increases in product cost that we may not be able to pass on to our customers  reductions in product pricing due to competitor promotional activities  changes in inventory requirements based on longer delivery times of the manufacturers or other requirements which would negatively impact our delivery and distribution capabilities  reduced availability under our asset based revolving credit facility as a result of borrowing base requirements and the impact on the borrowing base calculation of changes in the performance or eligibility of the customer receivables financed by that facility  reduced availability under our revolving credit facility or term loan as a result of non compliance with the covenant requirements  reduced availability under our revolving credit facility as a result of the inability of any of the financial institutions providing those facilities to fund their commitment  reductions in the capacity or inability to expand the capacity available for financing our customer receivables portfolio under existing or replacement financing programs or a requirement that we retain a higher percentage of the credit portfolio under such programs  
table of contents increases in borrowing costs interest and administrative fees relative to our customer receivables portfolio associated with the funding of our customer receivables  increases in personnel costs or other costs for us to stay competitive in our markets  and inability to renew or replace all or a portion of our current credit facilities at their maturity dates 
if necessary  in addition to available cash balances  cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under our revolving facilities  additional cash to fund our growth and increases in customer receivables balances could be obtained by delaying capital expenditures for new store openings  reducing the size of our customer credit portfolio  taking advantage of longer payment terms and financing available for inventory purchases  utilizing other sources for providing financing to our customers  negotiating to expand the capacity available under existing credit facilities  and accessing equity or debt markets 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain these sources of funding on favorable terms  if at all 
capital expenditures 
we lease of our stores  and our plans for future store locations include primarily leases  but do not exclude store ownership 
our capital expenditures for future new store projects should primarily be for our tenant improvements to the property leased including any new distribution centers and warehouses  the cost of which is approximately million per store  and for our existing store remodels  in the range of  per store remodel  depending on store size 
in the event we purchase existing properties  our capital expenditures will depend on the particular property and whether it is improved when purchased 
we are continuously reviewing new relationship and funding sources and alternatives for new stores  which may include sale leaseback or direct purchase lease programs  as well as other funding sources for our purchase and construction of those projects 
if we are successful in these relationship developments  our direct cash needs should include only our capital expenditures for tenant improvements to leased properties and our remodel programs for existing stores  but could include full ownership if it meets our cash investment strategy 
as a result of the recent volatility in the capital markets  we modified our store opening plans and currently have no new store openings planned 
we have historically grown our new store count by about per year and in the future expect to return to this modest  controlled pace based on capital availability 
cash flow operating activities 
during the year ended january   net operating cash flows decreased to million provided by operating activities  from million provided by operating activities in the twelve months ended january  operating cash flows for the year ended january  were driven primarily by a decrease in accounts receivable as increased use of cash flow for inventory was largely offset by an increase in accounts payable 
investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities increased million  from the prior fiscal year due to reduced expenditures for property and equipment from fiscal year and the release of restricted cash balances upon the termination of the securitization program 

table of contents financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities increased by million from million used during the year ended january   to million used during the year ended january   as we repaid amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility with cash flow generated from the reduction in the balance of customer receivable portfolio and used proceeds from our rights offering and new financing facilities to retire the debt under our prior securitization program 
contractual obligations the following table presents a summary of our known contractual obligations as of january   with respect to the specified categories  classified by payments due per period 
payments due by period dollars in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt revolving credit facility term loan note other notes operating leases real estate equipment purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations if the outstanding balance as of january  and the interest rate in effect at that time were to remain the same over the remaining life of the facility  interest payments on the facility would be approximately million for each of the fiscal years ended january  and and million for the fiscal year ended january   respectively 
if the outstanding balance as of january  and the interest rate in effect at that time were to remain the same over the remaining life of the term loan note  interest payments on the facility would be approximately million for each of the fiscal years ended january   and and million for the year ended january   respectively 
includes contracts for long term communication services 
does not include outstanding purchase orders for merchandise  services or supplies which are ordered in the normal course of operations and which generally are received and recorded within days 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates under our expanded asset based revolving credit facility are variable and bear interest at libor plus a spread ranging from basis points to basis points  based on a leverage ratio defined as total liabilities to tangible net worth 
our million second lien term loan bears interest at the greater of libor or  plus a spread of basis points 
accordingly  changes in libor will affect the interest rate on  and therefore our costs under  these credit facilities 
since january   the balance outstanding under our asset based revolving credit facility has increased from million to million at january  the notional balance of interest swaps used to fix the rate on a portion of asset based revolving credit facility balance is million at january  a basis point increase in interest rates on the asset based revolving credit facility would increase our borrowing costs by million over a month period  based on the balance outstanding at january   after considering the impact of the interest rate swaps  not considering the maturity for the current interest rate swaps which mature in april and july of because libor is more than basis points below the minimum rate under the term loan  a basis point change in libor would not impact the current anticipated interest expense under that loan
