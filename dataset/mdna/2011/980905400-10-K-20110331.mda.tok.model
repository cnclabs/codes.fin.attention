introduction world heart corporation and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as worldheart or the company 
the following management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a was prepared by management and discusses material changes in our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows for the years ended december   and such discussion and comments on the liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in this discussion  all amounts are in united states dollars us dollars unless otherwise stated 
overview the discussion and comments contained hereunder include both historical information and forward looking information 
the forward looking information  which generally is information stated to be anticipated  expected  or projected by management  involves known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results and performance to be materially different from any future results and performance expressed or implied by such forward looking information 
potential risks and uncertainties include  without limitation our need for additional significant financing in the future  risks associated with our levacor ventircular assist device vad bridge to transplant btt clinical trial  including any risks related to the pause in the btt trial enrollment  costs and delays associated with research and development  manufacturing  pre clinical testing and clinical trials for our products and next generation candidates  such as the levacor vad  the minimally invasive vad  and the pediaflow vad  our ability to manufacture  sell and market our products  decision  and the timing of decisions made by health regulatory agencies regarding approval of our products  competition from other products and therapies for heart failure  continued slower than anticipated destination therapy dt adoption rate for vads  limitations on third party reimbursements  our ability to obtain and enforce in a timely manner patent and other intellectual property protection for our technology and products  our ability to avoid  either by product design  licensing arrangement or otherwise  infringement of third parties intellectual property  our ability to enter into corporate alliances or other strategic relationships relating to the development and commercialization of our technology and products  loss of commercial market share to competitors due to our financial condition  our ability to remain listed on the nasdaq capital market  as well as other risks and uncertainties set forth under item a 
risk factors 
our business is focused on the development and sale of vads  particularly our levacor vad levacor vad or levacor 
vads are mechanical assist devices that supplement the circulatory function of the heart by re routing blood flow through a mechanical pump allowing for the restoration of normal blood circulation 
the levacor vad uses a magnetically levitated rotor resulting in no moving parts subject to wear  which is expected to provide multi year support 
in august  we received conditional approval of our investigational device exemption ide from the us food and drug administration fda for the levacor vad to begin a btt clinical study 
in january  we received unconditional ide approval from the fda 
the btt study enrollment will involve approximately subjects 
the follow up period for subjects in the btt study is six months with the end points of heart transplant  six month survival on the device or device removal for recovery and survival to days after device removal 
to date we have enrolled fifteen subjects in the btt study and we have activated nine clinical centers 
in july  the fda approved the expansion of the btt study by ten additional centers  for a total of centers 
in february  the company decided to pause enrollment in the btt study while three refinements are made to its levacor vad based on initial clinical experience 
these refinements are the projection of the inflow cannula into the ventricle  the elimination of a false alarm that has led to controller exchanges and the optimization of surface finishing coating manufacturing processes 
although we expect that the design modifications will be technically ready by the end of april  in light of ongoing communications with the fda  the timeline for implementation of these refinements is dependent on review and approval by the fda which is uncertain 

table of contents vads are used for treatment of patients with severe heart failure including patients whose hearts are irreversibly damaged and cannot be treated effectively by medical or surgical means other than transplant 
btt therapy involves implanting a vad in a transplant eligible patient to maintain or improve the patient s health until a donor heart becomes available 
dt is the implanting of a vad to provide long term support for a patient not currently eligible for a natural heart transplant 
bridge to recovery involves the use of vads to restore a patient s cardiac function helping the natural heart to recover and thereby allowing removal of the vad 
in addition  we  in conjunction with a consortium consisting of the university of pittsburgh  children s hospital of pittsburgh  carnegie mellon university and launchpoint technologies  inc launchpoint have been developing a small  magnetically levitated  rotary pediatric vad pediaflow vad 
the pediaflow vad is intended for use in newborns and infants and has been primarily funded by the national institutes of health nih 
in february  the fda granted humanitarian use device hud designation for the pediaflow vad 
the hud designation is given to devices that are intended to benefit patients with conditions that effect fewer than  patients per year 
under the hud designation  manufacturers are required to demonstrate safety and the probable benefit of their device 
the technology embodied in the pediaflow vad is also intended to form the basis for a small  minimally invasive vad 
the minimally invasive vad is aimed at providing partial to full circulatory support in both early stage and late stage heart failure patients 
we expect to be in an adult clinical trial with the minimally invasive vad in  contingent on our ability to obtain future financing and our ability to satisfactorily complete all regulatory requirements 
we are exploring various strategic options to accelerate our development of the minimally invasive vad

table of contents revenue 
sales of levacor vad implant kits  capital equipment and related peripheral equipment and services accounted for the majority of our revenue during the year ended december  in addition  we generated revenue from sales of spus segmented poly urethane solution  used by one other medical device manufacturer 
we do not expect any significant sales of spus to occur in the future 
the composition of revenue in thousands s  except for units  is as follows year ended december  amount of total units amount of total units product revenues implant kits peripherals and other total product revenue grant revenue total revenue product revenue during relates to levacor vad implants and periperhals 
product revenue during related to novacor vad peripherals 
total revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared to  for the year ended december  revenue from levacor vad implant kits sold during was million compared to zero for implant kit revenue for relates to levacor vads that were sold in our btt clinical study 
although we received an unconditional ide from the fda in january  in february  we paused enrollment in our btt trial while three refinements are made to our levacor vad based on initial clinical experience and the timeline for the reinitiating the study is uncertain 
we do not expect to generate any revenue until the restart of our btt trial 
peripherals and other revenue  including spus for and were  and  respectively 
we recognized  and zero in spus revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in spus revenue is a result a single sale to one customer with no purchase orders being placed in for the year ended december   we recorded  in grant revenue received from the irs qualifying therapeutic discovery project qtdp program compared to zero for the year ended december  cost of goods sold 
for the year ended december   cost of goods sold was million consisting of raw materials  labor  royalties payable  minimum annual royalties payable to several of our collaborative partners and other costs related to the manufacture of our levacor vad 
for the year ended december   cost of goods sold of  consisted entirely of royalties payable under minimum annual royalty agreements 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue is expected to improve in the future as we realize manufacturing efficiencies and are able to negotiate better pricing from third party vendors as our sales and production volume increase 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and related expenses for research personnel  consulting  prototype manufacturing  testing  clinical studies  material purchases and regulatory affairs incurred at our salt lake city and oakland facilities 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased by million or  compared with the year ended december  the decrease between periods is primarily attributable to capitalized materials  labor and overhead as a result of receiving ide approval from the fda in august and thus beginning to produce inventory which was previously expensed million  decrease in research 
table of contents expenses million of which  was related to in process research and development irp d costs associated with the launchpoint agreement and  was related to other research and development expense  decrease in legal fees relating to patent expense  and decrease in building related expenses 
these expenses were offset by an increase in payroll and related costs resulting from an increase in clinical and manufacturing personnel million  increase in clinical training and monitoring activities related to our levacor vad btt clinical study  increase in stock based compensation expense  increase in consulting fees  increase in facility expenses related to the move of our oakland personnel to a new office space  and an increase in depreciation expenses 
for the year ended december  and  we recorded  and  respectively  in stock based compensation expense 
research and development expenses are expected to increase during as we continue to develop our levacor vad  implement design changes  and continue activities on pre clinical testing and other product development 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for executives  marketing  accounting and administrative personnel 
selling expenses primarily relate to marketing and trade show costs 
our administrative expenses include professional fees  investor communication expenses  insurance premiums  public reporting costs and general corporate expenses 
the composition of selling  general and administrative expenses in thousands s is as follows year ended december  selling general and administrative total selling expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or  compared with the year ended december  the decrease is due to a decrease in personnel and related expenses  decrease in facilities and other allocated expenses resulting from decrease in personnel  and a decrease in consulting  travel and other selling expenses 
these decreases are offset by an increase in legal fees relating to the filing of trademarks  and increase in stock based compensation 
for the year ended december  and  we recorded  and  respectively  in stock based compensation expense 
selling expenses are expected to decline due to the pause in enrollment in our btt trail and subsequent delay in our marketing efforts or activities 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  compared with the year ended december  the decrease is due to a number of factors including the reduction in the number of general administration employees between periods which resulted in a decrease in payroll and related benefits expenses  decrease in consulting and other professional expenses  decrease in legal fees primarily related to the reincorporation into delaware and restructuring plan which were incurred in  decrease in general office expenses  and a decrease in insurance costs resulting from lower premiums 
these decreases are offset by increases in stock based compensation  increase in depreciation expense  and an increase in travel and entertainment expenses 
for the year ended december  and december   we recorded  and  respectively  in stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses are expected to remain at the same level in restructuring costs 
restructuring costs for the year ended december  and were zero and  respectively 
restructuring costs in consisted primarily of termination benefits of several employees  relocation benefits of our new ceo and fair value of the remaining lease payments on our oakland 
table of contents facility 
there were no such charges recorded in as of december   we have completed our restructuring plan and all accrued liabilities associated with the restructuring plan had been paid 
there has been no material change in the restructuring liability as initially measured 
we have realized operational efficiencies from this consolidation into one facility and we expect to realize cost savings especially in facilities related expenses 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles for the years ended december  and december  was zero and  respectively 
the intangible asset related to acquired medquest workforce  was being amortized on a straight line basis over four years and became fully amortized in august foreign exchange 
foreign exchange transactions resulted in a loss of  for the year ended december  compared to a loss of approximately  for the year ended december  gains and losses primarily relate to fluctuations in the relative value of the us dollar compared with the euro 
we anticipate significant fluctuations of foreign exchange gains and losses in the future 
investment and other income 
investment and other income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  investment and other income increased slightly during the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily due to higher average investment balances as a result of the recently completed private placement of our common stock in october we anticipate our investment income to decrease in future periods resulting from consumption of cash to fund operations  however  interest rates earned on our investments are anticipated to increase in the future 
loss on change in fair value of warrant liability we recorded a million non cash loss on change in fair value of warrant liability during the year ended december  related to warrants issued in our october financing 
the loss was primarily attributable to an increase in the common stock price from october to december  the warrants were classified as a liability due to a provision contained within the warrant agreement which allows the warrant holder the option to elect to receive an amount of cash equal to the value of the warrants as determined in accordance with the black scholes option pricing model with certain defined assumptions upon a change of control 
there were no similar warrants outstanding in the warrant liability will continue to fluctuate in the future based on inputs to the black scholes model including our current stock price  the remaining life of the warrants  the volatility of our stock price  and the risk free interest rate 
loss on liquidation of foreign entity we recorded a million non cash loss on liquidation of foreign entity during the year ended december  related to world heart corporation changing its jurisdiction of incorporation from the federal jurisdiction of canada to the state of delaware and terminating a majority of operations in canada 
as this was a one time charge we do not expect a similar loss in the future 
loss on disposal of property and equipment 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized a loss of  and  respectively  on dispositions and write downs of assets 
interest expense 
for the year ended december   interest expense was  compared with  for the year ended december  interest expense recorded in and primarily relates to the effective interest rate on the million note issued to launchpoint in december under the launchpoint agreement 

table of contents results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  in thousands s except loss per common share year ended december  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit loss operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative clinical and marketing support non cash restructuring costs amortization of intangibles total operating expenses operating loss other income expense debt inducement expense unrealized foreign exchange gain loss investment and other income loss loss on disposal of property and equipment interest expense net loss applicable to common shareholders weighted average number of common shares outstanding basic and diluted basic and diluted loss per common share revenue 
historically  sales of novacor lvas implant kits and related peripheral equipment and services accounted for the majority of our revenue 
in addition  we generated revenue from sales of spus  a compound used by one other medical device manufacturer 
we have historically sold our products directly  except for a few countries where we sold through distributors 
the composition of revenue in thousands s  except for units  is as follows year ended december  amount of total units amount of total units product revenues implant kits peripherals and other total revenue product revenues during and relate to novacor implant kits and peripherals 

table of contents total revenue for the year ended december  was  reflecting a decrease of million or compared with the year ended december  there were zero and five novacor lvas implant kits sold during the years ended december  and  respectively 
novacor peripherals and other revenue were  for the year ended december   a decrease of million or compared with the year ended december  the overall revenue decrease was attributable to our november decision to reduce our commercial efforts with respect to the novacor lvas and focus our resources on the development of our levacor vad 
in  we made the novacor lvas available to medical centers until our inventory was depleted 
we continue to support the one remaining long term novacor patient but have discontinued the manufacture and sale of the novacor lvas 
we recognized zero and  in spus revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was a result of spus revenue associated with one customer with no purchase orders being placed in cost of goods sold 
for the year ended december   cost of goods sold of  consisted entirely of royalties payable under minimum annual royalty agreements with vertellus uk limited and launchpoint 
for the year ended december   cost of goods sold of  was of total revenue 
cost of goods sold during the year ended december  consisted of raw materials  labor  royalties and other costs related to the manufacture of our novacor lvas  as well as novacor lvas inventory write downs of  research and development 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased by million or compared with the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased research and developments efforts related to the levacor vad build for clinical trials  increased stock based compensation expense  increased clinical research organization cro costs associated with our planned levacor vad clinical study  and an increase in other research expenses  of which  was in process research and development ipr d costs associated with the launchpoint agreement 
these increases were offset in part by decreased salaries resulting from our phased consolidation plan to our salt lake city  utah facility announced in august  
for the year ended december   we recorded  in stock based compensation expense associated with research and development employees compared with  recorded in december  selling  general and administrative 
the composition of selling  general and administrative expenses in thousands s is as follows year ended december  selling general and administrative total selling expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or compared with the same period in the decrease was attributable to the continued decline of our novacor lvas support efforts 
for the years ended december   we recorded  in stock based compensation expense compared with  in the same period of general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or versus the same period in this increase was attributable to salaries  and benefits  consulting  recruiting and legal fees associated with our phased consolidation plan  including hiring of our new ceo and cfo and the transition of our former ceo into another executive position  and increased stock based compensation expense 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded  and  respectively  in stock based compensation expense associated with general and administrative employees 

table of contents clinical and marketing support 
on december   we issued a year warrant to abiomed to purchase up to  of our common shares  exercisable at per share as compensation for clinical and marketing support services 
upon issuance  approximately of the warrant was immediately exercisable and the remaining became exercisable in january in we recorded a non cash clinical marketing and support services expense of million related to the fair value of the warrant 
there was no such charge recorded in the warrant was terminated in july pursuant to the terms of the recapitalization agreement 
restructuring costs 
restructuring costs in and were  and  and consisted primarily of termination benefits of several employees  relocation benefits of our new ceo and fair value of the remaining lease payments on our oakland facility 
the terms of the employment agreement of our new ceo  hired in the first quarter of  contained a relocation benefits package to cover reimbursement for certain relocation related expenses in an amount of up to  plus additional estimated tax gross up payments of up to  we recorded restructuring charges of  inclusive of tax gross up payment during the year ended december  we do not expect to record additional relocation expenses for the ceo in the future 
additionally  we recorded  and  during the year ended december  and  respectively  for termination benefits for employees whose positions were eliminated in connection with the relocation of our corporate office to salt lake city  utah 
additionally  we recorded  during the year ended december  related to minimum lease payments on our oakland facility associated with unused space due to the restructuring 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles for the years ended december  and december  was  and  respectively 
the intangible asset related to acquired medquest workforce was amortized on a straight line basis over four years and was fully amortized in august debt inducement expense 
during the year ended december   we recorded a non cash expense of million associated with the beneficial conversion rights of the induced conversion of the abiomed note and termination of previously existing agreements and warrants 
there was no such charge recorded for the year ended december  foreign exchange 
foreign exchange transactions resulted in a loss of  for the year ended december  compared to a gain of approximately  for the year ended december  gains and losses were primarily related to fluctuations in the relative value of the us dollar compared with the euro and the canadian dollar 
investment and other income 
investment and other income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  although average daily balances of invested cash were greater in  earnings were lower due to the significant decline in interest rates in loss on disposal of property and equipment 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized losses of  and  respectively  on dispositions and write downs of assets 
interest expense 
for the year ended december   interest expense was  compared with million for the year ended december  interest expense recorded in was primarily related to the effective interest rate on the million note issued to launchpoint in december under an intellectual property agreement 
interest expense recorded in was related to a million charge on the beneficial conversion feature of the million convertible note issued to abiomed on january  abiomed note   in interest expense at on the entire million convertible note   in interest expense on the bridge loan facility and  in interest expense related to other financing arrangements 
the abiomed note and accumulated interest thereon were converted into common shares as part of the recapitalization agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements none 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded losses from operations through the sale of equity and issuance of debt instruments 
combined with revenue and investment income  these funds have provided us with the resources to operate our business  sell and support our products  attract and retain key personnel  fund our research and development programs and clinical studies  and apply for and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million in available for sale investment securities totaling million  compared to a total of million as of december  for the year ended december   cash used in operating activities was million  consisting primarily of the net loss of million and  in accretion of discount on marketable securities  offset by million for the non cash loss on the liquidation of foreign entity  million for change in the fair value of the warrant liability  million for non cash stock compensation expense   for non cash interest on the launchpoint note   for amortization and depreciation expense and  loss on disposal of property 
additionally  working capital changes consisted of cash decreases related to a  increase in trade and other receivables  million increase in inventory and cash increases related to a  decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  offset by a  increase in accrued compensation and  decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities consisted of million related primarily to the net purchase of marketable investment securities and  in the purchase of property and equipment 
for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities was million related primarily to net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock in private placements of equity that occurred january and october at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  a decrease of million from december  for the year ended december   cash used to fund operating activities was million  consisting primarily of the net loss for the period of million  offset by non cash charges of  for depreciation and amortization  million for stock compensation expense and  in interest and in process research and development related to the launchpoint note 
working capital changes consisted of cash increases related to a  decrease in trade and other receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets and a  increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
this was offset by cash decreases related to an increase in inventories of  and a  decrease in accrued compensation 
investing activities in requiring cash resources consisted of  in property and equipment additions primarily related to levacor vad tooling and manufacturing equipment and  in the purchase of marketable investment securities 
financing activities in included proceeds of  from the exercise of warrants and  from the sale of property and equipment offset by  of capital lease repayments 
we expect that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to allow us to maintain our current and planned operations through at least however  our actual needs will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our levacor vad clinical trial  the progress and scope of our internally funded research and development activities and our success in manufacturing levacor vad on a timely basis sufficient to meet the needs of our clinical study 
in february  we paused enrollment in our btt trial based on initial clinical experience and the timeline for the reinitiating the study is uncertain 
we do not expect to generate any revenue until the restart of our btt trial 
our levacor vad clinical trial may be modified or terminated for many reasons including the risk that our device demonstrates safety issues  the risk that regulatory authorities may not approve our device for further development or may require additional or expanded clinical studies to be performed  and the risk that we or our suppliers may not be able to supply sufficient quantities of our device  parts  or materials to support clinical trial  which could lead to a disruption or cessation of the clinical study 
if any of the events occur  our actual capital needs may substantially exceed our anticipated capital needs and we may have to substantially modify or terminate current and planned clinical trial  postpone conducting future clinical studies or change our strategic direction 
as a result  our business may be materially harmed  our stock price may be adversely affected  and our ability to raise additional capital may be impaired 

table of contents we will need to raise substantial additional funds to support our long term research  product development and commercialization programs 
we regularly consider various fund raising alternatives  including  for example  debt or equity financing and merger and acquisition alternatives 
we may also seek additional funding through strategic alliances  collaborations  or license agreements and other financing mechanisms 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs  or to obtain funds through arrangements with licensees or other that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies that we by otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue and research and development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  accrual of research and development expenses  inventory capitalization  and  share based compensation  revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with asc  revenue recognition 
pursuant to purchase agreements or orders  we ship product to our customers 
revenue from product sales is only recognized when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to our customers  the selling price is fixed and collection is reasonably assured 
beginning in  a majority of our product sales are made on a consignment basis and as such  pursuant to the terms of the consignment arrangements  revenue is generally recognized on the date the consigned product is implanted or otherwise consumed 
revenue from product sales not sold on a consignment basis is generally recognized upon customer receipt and acceptance of the product 
beginning in  revenue is being recognized from sales of the levacor vad in connection with our btt clinical trial 
in february  we paused enrollment in our btt trial while three refinements are made to our levacor vad based on initial clinical experience and the timeline for the reinitiating the study is uncertain 
we do not expect to generate any revenue until the restart of our btt trial 
the significant elements of our multiple element offerings are implant kits  peripherals and other 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we recognize revenue using the residual method as described in asc  revenue recognition of multiple element arrangements 
under the residual method  revenue is allocated and deferred for the undelivered elements based on relative fair value 
the determination of fair value of the undelivered elements in multiple elements arrangements is based on the price charged when such elements are sold separately  which is commonly referred to as vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe 
each element s revenue is recognized when all of the revenue recognition criteria are met 
trade receivables are recorded for product sales and do not bear interest 
we regularly evaluate the collectability of trade receivables 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated credit losses 
when estimating credit losses  we consider a 
table of contents number of factors including the aging of a customer s account  credit worthiness of specific customers  historical trends and other information 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
at december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was zero and  respectively 
accrual of research and development expenses 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries and benefits  costs paid to third party contractors to conduct clinical trials  develop and manufacture devices  and associated overhead and facilities costs 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
invoicing from third party contractors for services performed can lag several months 
we accrue the costs of services rendered in connection with third party contractor activities based on our estimate of management fees  site management and monitoring costs and date management costs 
differences between actual clinical trial costs and estimated clinical trial costs have not be material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
inventory capitalization 
we expense costs relating to the production of inventories as research and development r d expense in the period incurred until such time as we believe future commercialization is considered probable and future economic benefit is expected to be recognized  which generally is reliant upon receipt of regulatory approval 
we then begin to capitalize subsequent inventory costs relating to the product 
we received a conditional ide in august from the fda for the levacor vad and subsequently began selling our product through our btt clinical trial 
therefore  effective august   we adopted a policy for capitalizing inventory and recognizing cost of sales related to the levacor vad 
prior to august   all costs associated with the manufacturing the levacor vad and related surgical and peripheral products were expensed as r d costs 
therefore  gross margin on sales of our product will be higher until our zero cost inventory is fully consumed 
inventories are stated at the lower cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out  fifo method 
we utilize a standard costing system  which requires significant management judgment and estimates in determining and applying standard labor and overhead rates 
labor and overhead rates are estimated based on our best estimate of annual production volumes and labor rates and hours per manufacturing process 
these estimates are based on historical experience and budgeted expenses and production volume 
estimates are set at the beginning of the year and updated periodically 
while we believe our standard costs are reliable  actual production costs and volume change may impact inventory  costs of sales and the absorption of production overhead expenses 
we review our inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
we included in inventory materials and finished goods that can be held for sale or used in non revenue clinical trials 
products consumed in non revenue clinical trials are expensed as part of research and development when consumed 
share based compensation 
we recognize share based compensation expense in connection with our share based awards  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  and therefore only recognize compensation costs for those awards expected to vest over the service period of the award 
we use a black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options 
calculating share based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective judgment and assumptions  including estimates of expected life of the award  stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and risk free interest rates 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of shared based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

table of contents when appropriate  we estimate the expected life of a stock option by averaging the contractual term of the stock option grants up to years with the associated vesting term typically or years 
we estimate the volatility of our publicly traded shares 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on our historical experience of forfeitures and our employee retention rate 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
we estimate the risk free interest rate based on rates in effect for united states government bonds with terms similar to the expected lives of the awards at the time of grant 
estimates of share based compensation expenses are significant to our financial statements  but these expenses are based on option valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by us 
contractual obligations the company is committed to minimum lease payments for office facilities and equipment  purchase obligations  note payable  interest  licenses  and royalty payments on net sales of the levacor vad or other future products 
the following represents our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands total less than year years years thereafter operating leases purchase obligations note payable gross interest on note payable capital lease obligations minimum royalty payment obligations total purchase obligations primarily represent commitments for services  manufacturing agreements  purchase commitments and research and development licensing agreements 
includes only one year of minimum annual royalty payments that have variable or indefinite termination dates 
from time to time  the company enters into collaborative arrangements for the research and development r d  manufacture and or commercialization of products and product candidates 
these collaborations can provide for non refundable  upfront license fees  r d and commercial performance milestone payments  cost sharing and royalty payments 
the company s collaboration agreements with third parties are performed on a best efforts basis with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success 
see note of our financial statements for more information on our various licensing and royalty agreements 
operating leases our headquarters and manufacturing facilities are located in salt lake city  utah 
the lease expires in january  the salt lake city facility security deposits total  we have administrative offices located in oakland  california 
the lease at this facility expires on october  the oakland facility does not have a security deposit 
capital expenditures capital expenditures 
table of contents capital expenditures for decreased slightly from the majority of capital additions made in were to prepare for the initiation of our btt clinical trial in january  while capital expenditures in were for various tooling related to our levacor vad  as well as leasehold improvements to our salt lake facility and the acquisition and implementation of a new accounting and material requirements planning mrp system 
we anticipate that capital expenditures for will be at the same level as as of december   we purchased capital assets of approximately  which we are financing and recorded under current capital leases 
during the year ended december   we occupied facilities in salt lake city  utah and in oakland  california 
our headquarters facility is in salt lake city consisting of  square feet of research and office space  pursuant to a lease that has been extended until january  our oakland facility consists of  square feet of office space 
the lease on the new oakland office space became effective november   for a term of one year  expiring october  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of market risk sensitive instruments caused by fluctuations in rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows
