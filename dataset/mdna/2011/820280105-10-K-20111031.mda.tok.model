item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations backlog for information regarding our backlog concentrations as of august  we conduct our business development efforts principally with an in house sales force 
additionally  we engage independent contractors to market to certain clients and geographic areas 
we pay our sales force a base salary plus  when appropriate  an annual bonus that may consist of cash  stock options  restricted stock awards  stock  or any combination thereof 
we pay our independent contractors on a commission basis that also may include a monthly retainer 
a portion of our business  primarily our nuclear and fossil power plant maintenance business  is seasonal  resulting in fluctuations in revenues and gross profit in our plant services segment during our fiscal year 
generally  spring and autumn are the peak periods for our plant services segment 
competition the industries we serve are highly competitive and  for the most part  require substantial resources and highly skilled and experienced technical personnel 
a large number of regional  national  and international engineering and construction companies are competing in these industries  and certain competitors may have greater financial and other resources and more experience  industry knowledge  and client relationships 
companies that we compete with in our power segment include bechtel corporation  fluor corporation  urs corporation  black veatch corporation  kiewit corporation and zachry corporation 
companies that we compete with in our e c segment include cb i lummus  kbr  inc  samsung  the linde group  and technip 
companies that we compete with in our e i segment include chm hill  urs  fluor  jacobs engineering group  inc  bechtel  aecom  and tetratech  inc 
companies that we compete with in our plant services segment include fluor  day zimmerman  turner industries  kbr  and jacobs 
companies that we compete with in our f m segment consist of a number of smaller pipe fabricators in the us  while internationally our principal competitors are divisions of large industrial firms 
companies that compete with our investment in westinghouse segment include areva  general electric ge  mitsubishi  hitachi  and atomstroyexport

backlog of unfilled orders our backlog represents management s estimate of future revenues expected to be realized from contracts awarded to us by clients 
backlog is estimated using legally binding agreements for projects that management believes are likely to proceed 
management evaluates the potential backlog value of each project awarded based upon the nature of the underlying contract  commitment and other factors  including the economic  financial  and regulatory viability of the project and the likelihood of the contract proceeding 
projects in backlog may be increased or decreased for scope change and or may be suspended or cancelled at any time by our clients 
the following table sets forth backlog by segment at august  and in millions august  august  power plant services e i e c f m total backlog for additional information with respect to our backlog as of august  and  see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  see part i  item a risk factors for a discussion of risks related to our backlog 
types of contracts our work is performed under two general types of contracts cost reimbursable contracts and fixed price contracts 
both types of contracts may be modified by cost escalation provisions or other risk sharing mechanisms  and both may include incentive and penalty provisions 
each of our contracts may contain components of more than one of the contract types discussed below 
for example  some of our contracts have elements of cost reimbursable with a maximum target price  fixed price subject to certain adjustments and fixed price and cost reimbursable provisions encompassed within one contract 
during the term of a project  the contract or components of the contract may be renegotiated to include characteristics of a different contract type 
we attempt to focus our epc activities on a cost reimbursable plus a fee or markup and negotiated fixed price work  each as described in more detail below 
we believe these types of contracts may help reduce our exposure to unanticipated and unrecoverable cost overruns 
when we negotiate any type of contract  we frequently are required to accomplish the scope of work and meet certain performance criteria within a specified timeframe  otherwise  we could be assessed damages that  in many cases  are pre agreed upon liquidated damages 
all contract types are subject to client authorized amendment 
at august   approximately of our backlog was comprised of cost reimbursable contracts and was comprised of fixed price contracts 
see note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies for a discussion of the nature of our operations and types of contracts 
us government contracts typically are awarded through competitive bidding or negotiations pursuant to federal acquisition regulations and may involve several bidders or offerors 
government contracts also typically have annual funding limitations  are limited by public sector budgeting constraints and may be terminated at the discretion of the government agency with payment only for work performed and commitments made at the time of termination 
in the event of termination  we generally receive some allowance for profit on the work performed 
many of these contracts are multi year indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity idiq agreements 
these programs provide estimates of a maximum amount the agency expects to spend 
our program management and technical staffs work closely with the government agency to define the scope and amount of work required 
although these contracts initially do not provide us with a specific amount of work  as projects are defined  the work may be awarded to us without further competitive bidding 
we generally include in our backlog an estimate of the work we expect to receive under these specific agreements 
although we generally serve as the prime contractor on our federal government contracts  or as part of a joint venture acting as the prime contractor  we also may serve as a subcontractor to other prime contractors 
with respect to bidding on large  complex environmental contracts  we have entered into  and expect to continue to enter into  joint venture or teaming arrangements with competitors 
us government contracts are subject to oversight audits by government representatives  profit and cost controls  and limitations and provisions permitting modification or termination  in whole or in part  without prior notice  at the government s discretion 
government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of socio economic and other requirements 
failure to comply with such regulations and requirements could lead to suspension or debarment  for cause  from future government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time 
some of the causes for debarment are violations of various statutes  including those related to employment practices  the protection of the environment  the accuracy of records and the recording of costs 
our continuing service agreements with clients expedite individual project contract negotiations through means other than the formal bidding process 
these agreements typically contain a standardized set of purchasing terms and pre negotiated pricing provisions and often provide for periodic price adjustments 
service agreements allow our clients to achieve greater cost efficiencies and reduced cycle times in the design and fabrication of complex piping systems for power generation  chemical and refinery projects 
additionally  while these agreements do not typically contain committed volumes  we believe that these agreements provide us with a steady source of new projects and help minimize the impact of short term pricing volatility and reduce our sales pursuit costs 
see part i  item a risk factors for additional discussion of the risks related to contractual arrangements  including our contracts with the us government 
raw materials and suppliers for our epc services  we often rely on third party equipment and raw materials manufacturers and subcontractors to complete our projects 
we are not substantially dependent on any individual third party to support these operations  however  we are subject to possible cost escalations based on inflation  currency and other price fluctuations resulting from supply and demand imbalances 
in the future  our mix of third party suppliers will increase as our construction phase progresses on our major nuclear epc contracts  and we may experience increased dependence on particular suppliers as a result 
our principal raw materials for our pipe and steel fabrication operations are carbon steel  stainless and other alloy piping  which we obtain from a number of domestic and foreign steel producers 
the market for most raw materials is extremely competitive  and certain types of raw materials are available from only one or a few specialized suppliers 
in addition to manufacturing our own pipe fittings  we purchase some of our pipe fittings from other manufacturers 
these arrangements generally lower our pipe fabrication costs because we are often able to negotiate advantageous purchase prices as a result of the volume of our purchases 
if a manufacturer is unable to deliver the materials according to the negotiated terms  we may be required to purchase the materials from another source or manufacture our own pipe fittings at a higher price 
we keep certain items in stock at each of our facilities and transport items among our facilities as required 
we obtain materials that are more specialized from suppliers when required for a project 
in addition  see part i  item a risk factors for a discussion of our dependence on joint venture or consortium partners  subcontractors and equipment manufacturers 
environmental health safety ehs we actively promote a positive and proactive attitude toward safety in accordance with all applicable and related laws 
our mission is to be the industry leader in environmental  health and safety performance and our pursuit of this mission is evidenced by our achievements in reaching safety milestones  winning safety awards and maintaining a low occupational safety and health administration osha case rate 
we reached full commercial operation of a grassroots ethylene plant for eastern petrochemical company sharq in saudi arabia without a lost time incident 
we strive for zero injuries  illnesses and environmental incidents on all of our job sites 
industry certifications in order to perform certain aspects of nuclear power plant construction  fabrication and installation activities of american society of mechanical engineers asme section iii code items such as vessels  piping systems  supports and spent fuel canister storage containments at nuclear plant sites  our domestic subsidiary engineering and construction operations maintain the required asme certifications n  n  npt  and na stamps ns cert 
these asme certifications also authorize us to serve as a material organization for the supply of ferrous and nonferrous material 
we also maintain the national board nuclear repair certification nr stamp for n and n stamped nuclear components 
asme nqa is the nrc endorsed industry standard that defines the quality assurance program requirements for nuclear facility applications 
our module fabrication and assembly facility in lake charles  louisiana is a key contributor to the nuclear supply chain which commits to and complies with this standard 
in order to perform fabrication and repairs of coded piping systems  our domestic construction operations and fabrication facilities  as well as our subsidiaries in derby  uk  maracaibo  venezuela  and manama  bahrain  maintain the asme certification u and pp stamps 
the majority of our fabrication facilities  as well as our subsidiaries in derby  uk and manama  bahrain  also have obtained the required asme certification s stamp and the national board certification r stamp 
our domestic subsidiary engineering and construction operations also maintain the required asme certification s stamp and the national board repair certification r stamp  in addition to the asme certifications a  pp and u stamps and the national board registration certification nb stamp for s  a  pp and u stamped items 
our laurens  south carolina  pipe fabrication facility also maintains a nuclear piping asme certification npt stamp and is authorized to fabricate piping for nuclear power plants and to serve as a material organization to manufacture and supply ferrous and nonferrous material 
this facility also is registered by the international organization of standards iso 
substantially all of our north american engineering operations  as well as our uk and middle east operations  are registered also by the international organization of standards iso 
this registration provides assurance to our clients that we have procedures to control quality in our fabrication processes 
patents  tradenames and licenses and other intellectual property we consider our web based earned value application  shawtractm  to be proprietary assets 
in addition  our e c segment has developed or has the right to license leading process technologies  including technologies from third parties  used for the production of a variety of petrochemicals and chemicals 
we have a leading position in technology associated with the design and construction of plants that produce ethylene  which we protect and develop with license restrictions and a research and development program 
we believe our complete technology portfolio and experience in the commercial application of technologies and related know how differentiates us from our competitors  enhances our margins and provides early involvement in projects that may utilize our broad range of engineering  procurement and construction capabilities 
we also are developing and researching new technologies to complement and expand our offerings 
through our it group acquisition in and the acquisition of envirogen in  we acquired certain patents and proprietary technologies that are useful in our environmental remediation business 
the technologies include a number of processes for the treatment of soil and groundwater contaminated with a variety of compounds including organics  chlorinated organics  oxygenates and metals 
in addition  see part i  item a risk factors for the impact of changes in technology or new technology developments by our competitors could have on us 
environmental matters our us operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations at the federal  regional  state and local level relating to environmental protection and the safety and human health of personnel and the public 
these laws and regulations apply to a broad range of our activities  including those concerning emissions  discharges into waterways  and generation  storage  handling  treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes 
environmental protection laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental registrations  licenses  permits and other approvals 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in  among other things  the assessment of administrative  civil and or criminal penalties  the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders limiting or enjoining some or all of our future operations 
under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and comparable state laws applicable to our domestic operations  we may be required to investigate and remediate hazardous substances and other regulated materials that have been released into the environment 
cercla and comparable state laws impose strict and  under certain circumstances  joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise released  regardless of whether a company knew of or caused the disposal or release 
liable parties under cercla may be required to pay for the costs of remediating the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources  and for the costs of certain health studies 
in addition  where contamination may be present  it is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury  property damage and recovery of response costs 
our domestic operations generate solid wastes  including hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the resources conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state laws 
failure by us to handle and dispose of solid and hazardous wastes in compliance with rcra may result in the imposition of liability  including remedial obligations 
we also could incur environmental liability at sites where we have been contractually hired by potentially responsible parties prps to remediate contamination of the site 
some prps have from time to time sought to expand the reach of cercla  rcra and similar state statutes to make the remediation contractor responsible for site cleanup costs in certain circumstances 
these prps have asserted that environmental contractors are owners or operators of hazardous waste facilities or that the contractors arranged for treatment  transportation or disposal of solid or hazardous wastes or hazardous substances 
if we are held responsible under cercla or rcra for damages caused while performing services or otherwise  we may be forced to incur cleanup costs and other costs directly  notwithstanding the potential availability of contribution or indemnification from other parties 
the federal water pollution control act  also known as the clean water act  and applicable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters or waters of the united states 
the discharge of pollutants into jurisdictional waters is prohibited unless permitted by the epa or applicable state agencies 
in addition  the oil pollution act of imposes a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages  including natural resource damages  resulting from such spills in waters of the united states 
a responsible party includes the owner or operator of a facility 
the clean water act and analogous state laws provide for administrative  civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and  together with the oil pollution act of  impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning  as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal  remediation  and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges 
the federal clean air act and analogous state laws require permits for facilities that have the potential to emit substances into the atmosphere that could adversely affect environmental quality 
failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit requirements could result in the imposition of substantial administrative  civil and even criminal penalties 
more stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gases ghgs may be adopted in the future and could impact our business 
on december   the epa published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane  and other ghgs present an endangerment to public heath and the environment because emissions of such gases are  according to the epa  contributing to the warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climate changes 
based on these findings  the epa has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
the epa has adopted regulations that require a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and that regulates emissions of ghgs from certain stationary sources  effective january  also  the epa has adopted rules requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from specified large ghg emission sources in the united states  including petroleum refineries  on an annual basis  beginning in for emissions occurring in  as well as offshore and onshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore processing  transmission  storage and distribution facilities on an annual basis beginning in for emission occurring in in addition  the united states congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs and almost one half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of ghgs primarily through the planned development of ghg emission inventories and or regional ghg cap and trade programs 
most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions  such as electric power plants  or major producers of fuels such as refineries and gas processing plants  to acquire and surrender emission allowances 
the number or allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall ghg emission reduction goal 
it is not possible to predict at this time whether these requirements or any regulations or legislation adopted in the future to control ghg emissions would have an overall negative or positive impact on our business 
if these requirements increase the cost of doing business for our clients and reduce the demand for our clients products  the demand for our services could be reduced 
alternatively  these requirements could result in an increased demand for our services related to the reduction of ghg emissions 
finally  it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms including hurricanes  droughts  and floods  and other climatic events  if any such effects were to occur  they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations 
our operations outside of the us are subject to similar foreign governmental controls and restrictions pertaining to protection of the environment and the safety and health of personnel and the public 
for example  with respect to climate change  many foreign nations but not the us have agreed to limit emissions for ghg pursuant to the united nations framework convention on climate change  also known as the kyoto protocol 
failure to comply with foreign requirements  including the kyoto protocol  in areas outside of the us where we conduct operations may lead to government sanctions resulting in penalties  remedial obligations and injunctive relief against future activities 
the environmental  health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject are changing constantly  and it is impossible to predict the effect of such laws and regulations on us in the future 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
to date  our costs net of any insurance proceeds with respect to environmental compliance have not been material  and to our knowledge  we have not incurred any material net environmental liability 
however  we can provide no assurance that we will not incur material environmental costs or liabilities in the future

risk factors the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our stock price  business  financial condition and results of operations and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward looking statements are made in this form k 
the risk factors described below are not the only ones we face 
our stock price  business  financial condition and results of operations may also be affected by additional factors that are not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial or that are not specific to us  such as general economic conditions 
the categorization of risks set forth below is meant to help you better understand the risks facing our business and is not intended to limit consideration of the possible effects of these risks to the listed categories 
any adverse effects related to the risks discussed below may  and likely will  adversely affect many aspects of our business 
you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward looking statements under cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements on page in this form k 
all forward looking statements made by us are qualified by the risk factors described below 
risks related to our operations demand for our products and services is cyclical and vulnerable to economic downturns and reductions in private industry and government spending and or their ability to meet existing payment obligations 
if general economic conditions continue to weaken or the credit markets deteriorate  we may be unable to recover expenditures  our revenues  and profits  and our financial condition may be negatively impacted 
the industries we serve historically have been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general downturns in the domestic and international economies 
consequently  our results of operations have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate depending on the demand for products and services from these industries 
fluctuations in the economy can affect consumer s demand for electricity and thus our clients capital spending priorities 
due to the current economic downturn  many of our clients may face budget shortfalls or may delay capital spending resulting in a decrease in the overall demand for our services 
a decrease in federal  state and local tax revenue as well as other economic declines may result in lower government spending 
our clients may find it more difficult to raise capital in the future due to limitations on the availability of credit and other uncertainties in the credit markets 
this reduction in spending could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our clients may demand better pricing terms and their ability to timely pay our invoices may be affected by an ongoing weak economy 
our business traditionally lags recovery in the economy  therefore  our business may not recover immediately upon any economic improvement 
if the economy weakens further or government spending is reduced  then our revenues  net income and overall financial condition may deteriorate 
further  in many instances during the course of a project  we commit and or pay for products or expenses attributable to our clients with an understanding that the client will pay us per the terms of our commercial contract with them 
our clients may not be able to make such payments to us in a timely manner  or at all  in which case we could be forced to absorb these costs requiring that we commit our financial resources to projects prior to receiving payments from the client 
if a client defaults in making its payments on a project in which we have devoted significant financial resources  it could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we face substantial competition in each of our business segments 
we face competition from numerous regional  national and international competitors  some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
our competitors include well established  well financed businesses  both privately and publicly held  including many major energy equipment manufacturers and engineering and construction companies  some engineering companies  internal engineering departments at utilities and some of our clients 
the award of many of our contracts is determined by competitive bid 
that competition can impact the margin we earn on our contracts or cause us not to win the award 
for a discussion of certain specific competitors as well as the impact of competition on our business  please see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
our results of operations depend on new contract awards  however  the selection process and timing for performing these contracts are not within our control 
a substantial portion of our revenues is directly or indirectly dependent on winning new contracts 
we operate in highly competitive markets and it is difficult to predict whether and when we will be awarded new contracts due to a multiple of factors including the lengthy and complex bidding and selection process  client capital investment decisions  market conditions  available financing  government approvals  permitting and environmental matters 
further  most of those same factors can delay or stop a project 
consequently  we are subject to the risk of losing new awards to competitors and the risk a project may experience significant delay or cancellation impacting our results of operations and cash flows which fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the timing and size of new contract awards 
the march earthquake and tsunami that struck japan caused significant damage to power and transportation infrastructure  including several nuclear reactors 
as events at the japanese nuclear facilities continue to develop  potential risks associated with nuclear power production could slow the pace of global licensing and construction of new or planned nuclear power facilities or negatively impact existing facilities efforts to extend their operating licenses 
shaw currently has nuclear construction projects in the us and china  material amounts of which are included in our backlog 
while our clients have indicated they intend to move forward with these units  domestic utility companies intentions could be challenged if congress implements a moratorium on building nuclear reactors or the nrc slows the permitting process or adds additional permitting requirements 
the chinese government suspended approval of new nuclear projects and will conduct safety inspections of all plants under construction  but emphasized that china s long term nuclear development plans have not changed 
other governments have announced plans to review and or delay decisions to review new nuclear projects 
demand for nuclear power could be negatively affected by such action 
because several of our segments deal with nuclear power either directly or indirectly  this could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
further  if current contracts included in our backlog are significantly delayed  modified or canceled  our future revenues and earnings may be materially and adversely impacted 
while many of the contracts in our backlog provide for cancellation fees in the event clients cancel projects  these cancellation fees usually provide for reimbursement of our out of pocket costs  revenues for work performed prior to cancellation and a varying percentage of the profits we would have realized had the contract been completed 
however  upon cancellation we typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog for that particular contract 
we provide maintenance services for approximately one third of existing us nuclear plants and perform uprates at existing facilities 
should any of our customers fail to extend existing operating licenses  demand for those services may be negatively affected 
shaw and our customers may have ordered critical components for on going projects whether nuclear or non nuclear from japanese and global suppliers 
due to the severe damage to japan s infrastructure and many of its industrial facilities  and the impact of such damage on the global supply chain  delivery of such critical components could be significantly delayed  potentially delaying such projects  which could increase costs  and possibly subject us to liquidated damages 
many of our contracts include a force majeure provision excusing any potential delay resulting from a natural disaster or act of god  and we cannot guarantee the force majeure provisions under these contracts would provide us relief 
the investment in westinghouse segment could be materially and adversely affected by the events in japan to the extent demand diminishes for westinghouse s nuclear products  including its ap technology 
toshiba  a japanese company  is the majority owner of westinghouse 
on september   neh announced its intention to exercise the put option to sell the westinghouse equity back to toshiba 
the westinghouse cra will terminate upon the exercise of the put option and we can provide no assurance as to our ability to attract or retain additional work from toshiba 
see risks related to our investment in westinghouse could have an adverse effect on us 
our backlog of unfilled orders is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is  therefore  not a reliable indicator of our future revenues or earnings 
at august   our backlog was approximately billion 
our backlog consists of projects for which we have legally binding contracts or commitments from clients  including legally binding agreements without defined scope 
commitments may be in the form of written contracts for specific projects  purchase orders or indications of the amounts of time and materials we need to make available for clients anticipated projects 
our backlog includes expected revenue based on engineering and design specifications that may not be final and could be revised over time and for government and maintenance contracts that may not specify actual dollar amounts for the work to be performed 
for these contracts  we calculate our backlog of estimated work to be performed  based on our knowledge of our clients stated intentions or our historic experience 
projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time 
there can be no assurance we will realize revenues projected in our backlog or  if realized  such revenues will result in profits 
due to project terminations  suspensions and or changes in project scope and schedule  we cannot predict with certainty when or if our backlog will be performed 
material delays  cancellations or payment defaults could materially affect our balance sheet  results of operations and cash flow and may reduce the value of our stock 
for example  during the fiscal quarter ended may   we received notice from our client of a significant delay in the construction schedule for two new ap nuclear reactors to be located in florida 
our client advised us that activities for the project would be slowed considerably until the combined operating license col is issued by the nrc for the plant which we understand  if the license schedule remains on schedule  will occur in late as a result  the proposed first reactor is now expected to enter service in  with the second anticipated months later 
client cancellations could reduce our backlog  which  among other things  could materially impact the revenues and earnings 
many of the contracts in our backlog provide for cancellation fees in the event clients cancel projects 
these cancellation fees usually provide for reimbursement of our out of pocket costs  revenues for work performed prior to cancellation and a varying percentage of the profits we would have realized had the contract been completed 
however  upon cancellation we typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog for that particular contract 
the nature of our contracts  particularly our reimbursable and fixed price contracts  could adversely affect us 
approximately of our backlog at august   was from cost reimbursable contracts and the remaining was from contracts that are primarily fixed price 
revenues and gross profit from both cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts can be significantly affected by contract incentives penalties that may not be known or finalized until the later stages of the contract term 
we enter into contractual agreements with clients for some of our epc services to be performed based on agreed upon reimbursable costs and labor rates 
some of these contracts provide for the client s review of our accounting and cost control systems to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reimbursable costs invoiced 
these reviews could result in reductions in reimbursable costs and labor rates previously billed to the client 
under certain hybrid contracts such as reimbursable contracts containing a target price  we agree to the contract price of the project at the time we enter into the contract 
while we benefit from costs savings and earnings from approved change orders under target priced contracts  we are generally unable to recover all cost overruns to the approved contract price 
under certain reimbursable target price contracts  we share with the client any savings up to a negotiated or target ceiling 
when costs exceed the negotiated ceiling price  we may be required to reduce our fee or to absorb some or all of the cost overruns 
we also assume the risks related to revenue  cost and gross profit realized on fixed priced contracts that can vary  sometimes substantially  from the original projections due to changes in a variety of other factors that include  but are not limited to engineering design changes  unanticipated technical problems with the equipment being supplied or developed by us  which may require that we spend our own money to remedy the problem  changes in the cost of equipment  commodities  materials or labor  difficulties in obtaining required permits or approvals  changes in laws and regulations  changes in labor conditions  including the availability and productivity of labor  project modifications creating unanticipated costs  delays caused by local weather conditions  failure to perform by our project owners  suppliers or subcontractors  and general economic conditions 
these risks may be exacerbated by the length of time between signing a contract and completing the project because most fixed price contracts are long term 
the term of our contracts can be as long as approximately seven years 
long term  fixed price contracts are inherently risky and often make us subject to penalties if portions of the project are not completed in accordance with agreed upon time limits 
therefore  significant losses can result from performing large  long term projects on a fixed price basis 
these losses may be material  including  in some cases  up to or exceeding the full contract value in certain events of non performance  and could negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
many of our client contracts require us to satisfy specified design or epc milestones in order to receive payment for the work completed or equipment or supplies procured prior to achievement of the applicable milestone 
as a result  under these types of arrangements  we may incur significant costs or perform significant amounts of services prior to receipt of payment 
if the client determines not to proceed with the completion of the project or if the client defaults on its payment obligations  we may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred or for the amounts previously expended to purchase equipment or supplies 
in addition  many of our clients for large epc projects are project specific entities that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the epc project 
it may be difficult for us to collect amounts owed to us by these clients 
if we are unable to collect amounts owed to us for these matters  we may be required to record a charge against earnings related to the project  which could result in a material loss 
our failure to meet contractual schedule or performance requirements could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
in certain circumstances  we guarantee project completion by a scheduled date or certain performance testing levels 
failure to meet these schedule or performance requirements could result in a reduction of revenues and or additional costs  and these adjustments could exceed projected profits 
a project s revenues could also be reduced by liquidated damages withheld by clients under contractual penalty provisions  which can be substantial and can accrue on a daily basis 
our costs generally increase from schedule delays and or could exceed our projections for a particular project 
performance problems for existing and future contracts could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by us and could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within our industry and our client base 
for examples of the kinds of claims that may result from liquidated damages provisions and cost overruns  see note accounting for claims  unapproved change orders and incentives on long term construction contracts included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f if our joint venture or consortium partners  subcontractors or equipment manufacturers fail to perform their contractual obligations on a project  we could be exposed to the risk of loss  and in some cases  joint and several liability to our clients  loss of reputation and additional financial performance obligations that could result in reduced profits or  in some cases  significant losses 
we often enter into consortium arrangements and joint ventures as part of our power segment  e c segment and e i segment contracts in order to jointly bid and perform a particular project 
the success of these consortium agreements and joint ventures depends  in large part  on the satisfactory performance of the contractual obligations by our partners 
if our partners do not meet their obligations  the consortium or joint venture may be unable to adequately perform and deliver its contracted services 
under these circumstances  we may be required to incur additional costs  make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services and or to pay liquidated damages 
under agreements with joint and several liability  we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners 
these additional obligations could result in reduced profits or  in some cases  significant losses for us with respect to the joint venture  which could also negatively affect our reputation in the industries we serve 
additionally  we rely on third party partners  equipment manufacturers and third party subcontractors to complete our projects 
to the extent our partners cannot execute their portion of the work  are unable to deliver their services  equipment or materials according to the negotiated terms and or we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials  our ability to complete a project in a timely fashion or at a profit may be impaired 
if the amount we are required to pay for these goods and services in an effort to meet our contractual obligations exceeds the amount we have estimated in bidding for fixed price work  we could experience losses in the performance of these contracts 
if we are unable to form teaming arrangements  particularly for some of our international opportunities  our ability to compete for and win business may be negatively impacted 
in both the private and public sectors  either acting as a prime contractor  a subcontractor or as a member of consortium  we may join with other firms to form a team to compete for a single contract 
because a team can often offer stronger combined qualifications than any firm standing alone  these teaming arrangements can be very important to the success of a particular contract bid process or proposal 
this can be particularly true in international operations in which bidding success can be substantially impacted by the presence and or quality of the local partner 
the failure to maintain such relationships in both foreign and domestic markets may impact our ability to win work 
our government contracts may present risks to us 
we are a major provider of services to us government agencies and therefore are exposed to risks associated with government contracting 
government clients typically can terminate or modify contracts with us at their convenience 
as a result  our backlog may be reduced or we may incur a loss if a government agency decides to terminate or modify a contract with us 
we are also subject to audits  including audits of our internal controls systems  cost reviews and investigations by government contracting oversight agencies 
during the course of an audit  the oversight agency may disallow costs 
cost disallowances may result in adjustments to previously reported revenues and may require refunding previously collected cash proceeds 
in addition  our failure to comply with the terms of one or more of our government contracts or government regulations and statutes could result in our being suspended or barred from future government projects for a significant period of time  possible civil or criminal fines and penalties and the risk of public scrutiny of our performance  and potential harm to our reputation  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
other remedies that our government clients may seek for improper activities or performance issues include sanctions such as forfeiture of profits and suspension of payments 
our government contracts present us with other risks as well 
legislatures typically appropriate funds on a year by year basis  while contract performance may take more than one year 
as a result  our contracts with government agencies may be only partially funded or may be terminated  and we may not realize all of our potential revenues and profits from those contracts 
appropriations and the timing of payment may be influenced by  among other things  the state of the economy  competing political priorities  curtailments in the use of government contracting firms  budget constraints  the timing and amount of tax receipts and the overall level of government expenditures 
for the fiscal year ended august   of our e i segment s backlog was with us government agencies of which billion was funded and billion was unfunded 
the limitation or the modification of the price anderson act s indemnification authority and similar federal programs for nuclear and other potentially hazardous activities  could adversely affect our business 
the price anderson act paa comprehensively regulates the manufacture  use and storage of radioactive materials  while promoting the nuclear energy industry by offering indemnification to the nuclear industry against liability arising from nuclear incidents in the us for non military facilities for incidents in connection with contractual activity for doe  while still ensuring compensation for the general public 
the energy policy act of extended the period of coverage to include all nuclear power reactors issued construction permits through december  because we provide services to the doe at nuclear weapons facilities and the nuclear energy industry in the ongoing maintenance and modification  as well as decontamination and decommissioning  of its nuclear energy plants  we are entitled to the indemnification protections under the paa 
although the paa s indemnification provisions are broad  it does not apply to all liabilities that we might incur while performing services as a radioactive materials cleanup contractor for doe and the nuclear energy industry 
public law pl which indemnifies government contractors who conduct certain approved contractual activity related to unusually hazardous or nuclear activity  may provide additional or alternative indemnification for such activities 
if the contractor protection currently provided by the paa or pl is significantly modified  is not approved for  or does not extend to all of our services  our business could be adversely affected by either our clients refusal to retain us for potentially covered projects or our inability to obtain commercially adequate insurance and indemnification 
if the us were to change its support of nuclear power or revoke or limit doe s loan guarantee program lgp  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the us government has been supportive of increased investment in nuclear power 
however  if the us government changed its policy or public acceptance of nuclear technology as a means of generating electricity significantly wanes  demand for nuclear power could be negatively affected and potentially increase the regulation of the nuclear power industry 
because several of our segments deal with nuclear power either directly or indirectly  this could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
some of our clients may rely on doe s lgp  under which doe issues loan guarantees to eligible projects that avoid  reduce  or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and employ new or significantly improved technologies as compared to technologies in service in the us at the time the guarantee is issued 
if the current administration were to revoke or limit doe s lgp  it could make obtaining funding more difficult for many of our clients which could inhibit their ability to take on new projects resulting in a negative impact on our future operations 
we may be exposed to additional risks in our power segment  as we begin to execute our significant nuclear backlog and book new nuclear awards 
these risks include greater backlog concentration in fewer projects  possibly increasing requirements for letters of credit and potential cost overruns which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and liquidity 
additionally  the current economic conditions may impact the pace of the development of nuclear projects 
we expect to convert a significant part of our backlog of nuclear projects in the power segment into revenues in the future 
nuclear projects may utilize larger sums of working capital than other projects in this segment and will be concentrated among a few larger clients 
as we increase our active projects in the nuclear business  and consequently our reliance in revenues from this business  we may become more dependent on a smaller number of clients 
if we lose clients in our nuclear business and are unable to replace them  our revenues could be materially adversely impacted 
additionally  if any of the nuclear projects currently included in our backlog are significantly delayed  modified or canceled  our reported backlog and future earnings may be materially and adversely impacted 
as we convert our nuclear projects from backlog into active construction we may face significantly greater requirements for the provision of letters of credit or other forms of credit enhancements 
together with the construction costs for nuclear plants  which are significantly higher than those for coal or gas fired plants  we may be required to significantly expand our access to capital and credit 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to access such capital and credit as needed or that we would be able to do so on economically attractive terms 
finally  the significant expense associated with nuclear projects  weak global economic conditions and other competitive factors  including less expensive alternative energies like natural gas  may result in additional delays for currently expected projects or slower demand for nuclear energy projects over time 
environmental laws and regulations expose us to certain risks  could increase our costs and liabilities and impact demand for our services 
while all of our operations are impacted by environmental laws and regulations  these impacts may be most significant for our nuclear and integrated environmental solutions businesses 
general our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations  including those concerning emissions into the air  climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives  discharges into waterways  generation  storage  handling  treatment  transport and disposal of waste materials and hazardous substances  and human health and safety 
our projects often involve highly regulated materials  including hazardous and nuclear materials and wastes 
environmental laws and regulations generally impose limitations and standards relating to the use  handling  transport  discharge or disposal of regulated materials and require us to obtain a permit and comply with various other requirements 
the improper characterization  use  handling  discharge or disposal of regulated materials or any other failure to comply with federal  regional  state and local environmental laws and regulations or associated environmental permits may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations or the issuance of injunctions that could restrict or prevent our ability to perform some or all of our activities under existing contracts 
the risks associated with these activities are most significant within our e i segment  which  in addition to environmental remediation activities  has two subsidiaries the landbank group inc and shaw environmental liability solutions llc that previously purchased and or assumed liability with respect to properties that have experienced environmental damage 
we can provide no assurance that our insurance coverage or other loss remediation strategies will insulate us from any material liability associated with these operations 
in addition to existing environmental regulations  the adoption and implementation of regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from  our clients equipment and operations could significantly impact demand for our services  particularly among our clients for coal and gas fired generation facilities as well as our clients in the petrochemicals business 
any significant reduction in demand for our services as a result of the adoption of these or similar proposals could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations 
nuclear operations risks associated with nuclear projects  due to their size and complexity  may be increased by permit  licensing and regulatory approvals that can be even more stringent and time consuming than similar processes for more conventional construction projects 
we are subject to regulations from a number of entities  including the nuclear regulatory commission nrc  international atomic energy agency iaea and the european union eu  which have a substantial effect on our nuclear operations 
an example of the way these regulatory entities impact our business is the nrc s certification process for the ap design 
the nrc notified westinghouse that the proposed ap shield building design will require modification before it will certify the ap design 
the iaea and the eu both have systems for nuclear material safeguards 
global scale agreements on nuclear safety such as the convention on nuclear safety and the joint convention on the safety of spent fuel management and on the safety of radioactive waste management are also in place 
the euratom treaty has created uniform safety standards aimed at protecting the public and workers and passed rules governing the transportation of radioactive waste 
in addition  licensed nuclear facilities must comply with strict inspection procedures 
regulations governing the shutdown and dismantling of nuclear facilities and the disposal of nuclear wastes could also have an effect on our operations 
delays in receiving necessary approvals  permits or licenses  failure to maintain sufficient compliance programs  or other problems encountered during construction could significantly increase our costs and cause our actual results of operations to significantly differ from anticipated results 
unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation related to hazardous substances encountered in our businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are from time to time involved in various litigation and other matters related to hazardous substances encountered in our businesses 
in particular  the numerous operating hazards inherent in our businesses increase the risk of toxic tort litigation relating to any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances  including without limitation  current or past claims involving asbestos related materials  formaldehyde  cesium radiation  mercury and other hazardous substances  or related environmental damage 
as a result  we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures 
the outcome of such litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages  penalties or injunctive relief against us  limitations on our property rights  or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs 
if any of these disputes results in a substantial monetary judgment against us or an adverse legal interpretation is settled on unfavorable terms  or otherwise affects our operations  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our clients and our partners ability to receive the applicable regulatory and environmental approvals for our projects and the timeliness of those approvals could adversely affect us 
the regulatory permitting process for many of the projects performed by our power segment requires significant investments of time and money by our clients and sometimes by us and or our partners 
there are no assurances that we or our clients will obtain the necessary permits for these projects 
applications for permits to operate these fossil and nuclear fueled facilities  including air emissions permits  may be opposed by government entities  individuals or environmental groups  resulting in delays and possible non issuance of the permits 
for example  the nrc s notice to wec directing wec to modify the ap shield building  may cause a delay resulting in a schedule modification 
while we believe westinghouse will be able to satisfy the nrc s concerns and receive design certification  this or similar certification actions could affect or delay our ability to complete our projects 
additionally  we have been advised that activities for a proposed ap nuclear reactor to be built in florida will be slowed considerably until a col is issued by the nrc for the plant 
we understand that the issuance of the col may be delayed until late and  as a result  the first reactor is not expected to enter service until the timeframe  with the second anticipated months later 
due to the international nature of our business we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act  similar worldwide anti bribery laws  and various international trade and export laws 
the international nature of our business creates various domestic and local regulatory challenges 
the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit us based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
our policies mandate compliance with these anti bribery laws 
we operate in many parts of the world that experience government corruption to some degree  and  in certain circumstances  compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with those local customs and practices 
our fcpa policy and training provide our employees with procedures  guidelines and information about fcpa obligations and compliance 
further  we advise our partners  subcontractors  agents and others who work for us or on our behalf that they are obligated to comply with the fcpa 
we have procedures and controls in place designed to ensure internal and external compliance 
additionally  our global operations require us to import and export goods and technologies across international borders  which requires a robust compliance program 
however  such internal controls and procedures will not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents 
if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other regulatory violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence  or due to the acts or inadvertence of others  we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
political and economic conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us 
approximately of our fiscal year revenues were attributable to projects in international markets  some of which are subject to political unrest and uncertainty 
in addition to the specific challenges we face internationally  international contracts  operations and expansion expose us to risks inherent in doing business outside the us  including uncertain economic conditions in the foreign countries in which we make capital investments  operate and sell products and services  the lack of well developed legal systems and less established or traditional business practices in some countries in which we operate and sell products and services  which could make it difficult for us to enforce our contractual rights  security and safety of employees and subcontractors  expropriation of property  restrictions on the right to convert or repatriate currency  changes in labor conditions  changing general economic and political conditions in foreign markets  terrorist attacks  commodity prices and availability  potential incompatibility with foreign joint venture partners  and interruptions or delays in international shipping 
foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects or to obtain projects 
we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in usd or in the currencies of our expenditures 
however  we do enter into contracts that subject us to foreign exchange risks  particularly to the extent contract revenues are denominated in a currency different than the contract costs 
we attempt to minimize our exposure from foreign exchange risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies  or entering into hedge contracts when there are different currencies for contract revenues and costs 
however  these actions may not always eliminate all foreign exchange risks 
our westinghouse bonds are jpy denominated 
as the usd jpy exchange rate changes  the amount of usd required to service this debt will change 
risks related to our investment in westinghouse could have an adverse effect on us 
we incur significant jpy denominated cash interest cost on the westinghouse bonds issued to finance our investment in westinghouse  and we can provide no assurance that we will receive dividends from westinghouse sufficient to cover these costs 
in an effort to mitigate this risk  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time  to hedge the impact of exchange rate changes on our jpy denominated cash interest payments on the westinghouse bonds 
we normally focus our hedge transactions to the jpy interest payments due within the following twelve months 
in connection with our investment in westinghouse and issuing the westinghouse bonds  we entered into put option agreements with toshiba providing us the option to sell all or part of our westinghouse equity to toshiba during a defined exercise period  which we are currently within 
on september   neh announced that it intends to exercise its put options to sell the westinghouse equity to toshiba 
the exercise of the japanese yen denominated put options prior to october requires the consent of the trustee acting on behalf of the bond holders of the yen denominated bonds that were issued in connection with the funding of the acquisition of the westinghouse equity 
if the necessary consents are obtained  neh formally will notify toshiba in accordance with the terms of the put option agreements  and westinghouse equity will transfer days thereafter 
the funds received must be applied toward the redemption of the bonds on the next scheduled interest payment date 
under the terms of the put option agreements  if consent to redeem the bonds early is not granted  the put options will be exercised automatically on october   for cash settlement on january  proceeds from the sale would be used to repay the bonds in full on their scheduled maturity date of march  we can provide no assurance that the put options will be exercised prior to october  resulting from neh s expected request to bond holders trustee 
however  as previously disclosed  the westinghouse bond holders have the ability to cause us to put our westinghouse equity back to toshiba as a result of the occurrence of a toshiba event as defined under the indenture 
should the bondholders exercise this right  the put may occur prior to october  for additional information  see investment in westinghouse segment in our business segments above  note investment in westinghouse and related agreements  note equity method investments and variable interest entities and note debt and revolving lines of credit included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f and in liquidity below 
the nature of our projects exposes us to potential professional liability  product liability  warranty and other claims  which may reduce our profits 
we engineer  construct and perform services including pipe and steel fabrication in large industrial facilities where accidents or system failures can have significant consequences 
any such accident or failure at a site where we provided epc or similar services could result in significant professional liability  product liability  warranty and other claims against us  regardless of whether our products or services caused the incident 
further  the engineering and construction projects we perform expose us to additional risks including  but not limited to  equipment failures  personal injuries  property damage  shortages of materials and labor  permitting delays  work stoppages  labor disputes  weather problems and unforeseen engineering  architectural  environmental and geological problems  each of which could significantly impact our performance and materially impact our financial statements 
additionally  once our construction is complete  we may face claims relating to our job performance  which could materially impact our financial statements 
under some of our contracts  we must use client specified metals or processes for producing or fabricating pipe for our clients 
the failure of any of these metals or processes could result in warranty claims against us for significant replacement or reworking costs  which could materially impact our financial statements 
we have been and may in the future be named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may make a claim for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters 
should we be determined liable  we may not be covered by insurance or  if covered  the dollar amount of these liabilities may exceed our policy limits 
our professional liability coverage is on a claims made basis covering only claims actually made during the policy period currently in effect 
even where insurance is maintained for such exposures  the policies have deductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any such claims 
any damages not covered by our insurance  in excess of our insurance limits or  if covered by insurance subject to a high deductible  could result in a significant loss for us  which may reduce our profits and cash available for operations 
risks related to financial reporting and corporate governance actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions that we use to prepare our financial statements 
to prepare financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  our management is required to make estimates and assumptions  as of the date of the financial statements  that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
areas requiring significant estimates by our management include  among other things contract costs and profits and application of the percentage of completion method of accounting  revenues recognized  and reduction of costs recognized  as a result of contract claims and unapproved change orders  revenues recognized related to project incentives we expect to earn  recoverability of inventory and application of lower of cost or market accounting  provisions for uncollectible receivables and client claims and recoveries of costs from subcontractors  vendors and others  provisions for income taxes and related valuation allowances  recoverability of goodwill  recoverability of other intangibles and related estimated lives  valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations  valuation of defined benefit pension plans  and accruals for estimated assets and liabilities  including litigation and insurance recoveries reserves 
under our accounting policies  we measure and recognize a large portion of our profits and revenue under the percentage of completion accounting methodology 
this methodology allows us to recognize revenue and profits ratably over the life of a contract by comparing the amount of the cost incurred to date against the total amount of cost estimated to be incurred 
our actual results could differ materially from our estimates 
changes in reported amounts  the effects of those changes and changes in estimates may be recorded in future periods 
if we were required to write down all or part of our goodwill and or our intangible assets  our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected 
we had million of goodwill and million of intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at august  goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet  it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired 
we also perform an annual review of our goodwill and intangible assets to determine if it has become impaired which would require us to write down the impaired portion of these assets 
if we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill and or intangible assets  our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected 
we rely on our information systems to conduct our business  and failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
additionally  if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time  our business could be harmed 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems 
information systems are vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers and cyber terrorists 
we rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems 
however  these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches 
in addition  the unavailability of the information systems or the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and could result in decreased performance and increased overhead costs  causing our business and results of operations to suffer 
any significant interruption or failure of our information systems or any significant breach of security could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we have certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and by laws that may discourage a change of control of our company 
certain of our corporate governing documents contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
for example  certain provisions in our articles of incorporation authorize the board of directors to determine the powers  preferences and rights of preference shares and to issue preference shares without shareholder approval 
these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if the third party s offer may be considered beneficial by many shareholders 
other provisions require a supermajority vote 
for example  the affirmative vote of the holders of at least seventy five percent of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote on a matter not including shares deemed beneficially owned by a related person is required to authorize and or approve a merger  consolidation or business combination 
this supermajority vote requirement could make it difficult to complete a merger  consolidation or sale of our company 
the articles further provide that to change this supermajority requirement would itself require an affirmative vote of the holders of at least seventy five of the voting power of common stock 
any one of the provisions discussed above could discourage third parties from obtaining control of us 
these provisions may also impede a transaction in which our shareholders could receive a premium over then current market price and our shareholders ability to approve transactions that they consider in their best interests 
risks related to our liquidity and capital resources non compliance with covenants in our restated credit agreement facility  without waiver or amendment from the lenders  could require us to post cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit and could adversely affect our ability to borrow under the facility 
our facility contains certain financial covenants  including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio  which limit the amounts we may borrow 
in addition  we are required to file our quarterly and annual reports with the sec on a timely basis 
the defined terms used in calculating the financial covenants require us to follow gaap  which requires the use of judgments and estimates 
we may not be able to satisfy these ratios  especially if our operating results deteriorate as a result of  but not limited to  the impact of other risk factors that may have a negative impact on our future earnings 
additionally  we may not be able to file our sec reports on a timely basis 
a breach of any covenant or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our facility  and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary waivers or amendments from our lenders to remedy a default 
in the event of any default not waived  the lenders under our facility are not required to lend any additional amounts or issue letters of credit and could elect to require us to apply all of our available cash to collateralize any outstanding letters of credit  declare any outstanding borrowings  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable or require us to apply all of our available cash to repay any borrowings then outstanding at the time of default 
if we are unable to pay when due any material indebtness  to fund adequately the facility letter of credit collateral account or if any other default has occurred and is continuing under our restated credit agreement  our lenders could proceed to accelerate all of our obligations and we could be required to pay immediately any shortfall amount required to cover our obligations into the facility letter of credit collateral account 
if any future indebtedness under our facility is accelerated  we can provide no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 
at august   we had no outstanding borrowings under the facility with outstanding letters of credit inclusive of both financial and performance of approximately million 
our borrowing capacity under the facility is reduced by the aggregate amount of letters of credit we have outstanding 
further  we have entered into indemnity agreements with our sureties that contain cross default provisions 
accordingly  in the event of a default under our facility  we would need to obtain a waiver from our sureties or an amendment to our indemnity agreements 
we can provide no assurance that we would be successful in obtaining an amendment or waiver 
downgrades by rating agencies  inability to obtain adequate surety bonding or letters of credit could affect our business strategies by requiring us to modify existing bonding facilities and or reduce our ability to bid on new work which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and business prospects 
in certain circumstances  clients may require us to provide credit enhancements  including bonds or letters of credit 
in line with industry practice  we are often required to provide performance and surety bonds to clients 
these bonds and letters of credit provide credit support for the client if we fail to perform our obligations under the contract 
if security is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain a bond or letter of credit on terms commercially acceptable to us  we cannot pursue that project 
we have letter of credit and bonding facilities but  as is typically the case  the issuance of bonds under our surety facilities is at the surety s sole discretion 
in the event our debt ratings are lowered by independent rating agencies such as moody s investors service or standard poor s s p  it could be more difficult for us to obtain surety bonding for new projects in the future  and we may be required to increase or provide additional cash collateral to obtain these surety bonds  which would reduce our available cash and could impact our ability to renew or increase availability under our facility 
any new or modified bonding facilities might not be on terms as favorable as those we have currently  and we could also be subject to increased costs of capital and interest rates 
we continue to expand our business in areas where the underlying contract must be bonded  especially in government services in which bonding is predominately provided by insurance sureties 
these surety bonds indemnify the client if we fail to perform our obligations under the contract 
failure to provide a bond on terms required by a client may result in an inability to compete for or win a project 
historically  we have had a strong surety bonding capacity but  as is typically the case  bonding is at the surety s sole discretion 
in addition  because of a reduction in overall worldwide bonding capacity  we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide the contract required bonding 
moreover  these contracts are often very large and extremely complex  which often necessitates the use of a joint venture  often with a competitor  to bid on and perform these types of contracts  especially since it may be easier to jointly pursue the necessary bonding 
however  entering into these types of joint ventures or partnerships exposes us to the credit and performance risks of third parties  many of whom are not as financially strong as us 
restrictive covenants in our facility may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 
our facility limits our ability to  among other things incur indebtedness or contingent obligations  issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make distributions to our shareholders  repurchase or redeem our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  make investments  create liens  enter into sale leaseback transactions  incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us  enter into transactions with our shareholders and affiliates  sell and pledge assets  and acquire the assets of  or merge or consolidate with  other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 
these covenants may also impair our ability to engage in favorable business activities and our ability to finance future operations or capital needs in furtherance of our business strategies 
moreover  the form or level of our indebtedness may prevent us from raising additional capital on attractive terms or obtaining additional financing if needed 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our facility 
for additional information  see non compliance with covenants in our facility  without waiver or amendment from the lenders  could adversely affect our ability to borrow under the facility above 
because of the capital intensive nature of our business  we are vulnerable to significant fluctuations in our liquidity that may vary substantially over time 
our operations could require us to utilize large sums of working capital  sometimes on short notice and sometimes without assurance of recovery of the expenditures 
circumstances or events that could create large cash outflows include losses resulting from fixed price contracts  environmental liabilities  litigation risks  unexpected costs or losses resulting from acquisitions  contract initiation or completion delays  political conditions  client payment problems  foreign exchange risks and professional and product liability claims 
our borrowing levels and debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to fulfill our obligations under our facility 
at august   we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately  million  approximately  million of which relates to our westinghouse bonds and is of limited recourse to us 
in addition  at august   letters of credit  domestic and foreign  issued for our account in an aggregate amount of million were outstanding and we had no borrowings under our facility 
our indebtedness could have important consequences  including the following requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt  which reduces the cash available for other business purposes  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and creating additional liens on our assets  limiting our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in our business  placing us at a competitive disadvantage if we are more leveraged than our competitors  making us more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions  and restricting us from making additional investments or acquisitions by limiting our aggregate debt obligations 
to the extent that new debt is incurred in addition to our current debt levels  the leverage risks described above would increase 
risks related to labor and employment our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel  including engineers  skilled workers and key officers  could have an adverse effect on us 
our ability to attract and retain qualified professional and or skilled personnel in accordance with our needs  either through direct hiring or acquisition of other firms employing such professionals  is an important factor in determining our future success 
the market for these professionals is competitive  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain needed personnel 
our ability to successfully execute our business strategy depends  in part  on our ability to attract and retain skilled laborers and craftsmen in our pipe fabrication and construction businesses 
demand for these workers can at times be high and the supply extremely limited 
our success is also highly dependent upon the continued services of our key officers  and we do not maintain key employee insurance on any of our executive officers 
if we are unable to retain qualified personnel  the roles and responsibilities of those employees will need to be filled  which may require that we devote time and resources to identifying  hiring and integrating new employees 
in addition  the failure to attract and retain key employees  including officers  could impair our ability to provide services to our clients and conduct our business effectively 
work stoppages  union negotiations and other labor problems could adversely affect us 
at august   approximately of our employees were represented by labor unions 
a lengthy strike or other work stoppage at any of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on us 
there is inherent risk that on going or future negotiations relating to collective bargaining agreements or union representation may not be favorable to us 
from time to time  we have also experienced attempts to unionize our non union shops 
such efforts can often disrupt or delay work and present risk of labor unrest 
we may be required to contribute cash to meet our underfunded pension obligations in certain multi employer pension plans 
domestically  we participate in various multi employer pension plans under union and industry wide agreements that  generally  provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements 
absent an applicable exemption  a contributor to a multiemployer plan is liable  upon termination or withdrawal from a plan  for its proportionate share of the plan s underfunded vested liability 
funding requirements for benefit obligations of our pension plans are subject to certain regulatory requirements and we may be required to make cash contributions which may be material to one or more of these plans to satisfy certain underfunded benefit obligations 
our employees work on projects that are inherently dangerous and a failure to maintain a safe work site could result in significant losses 
safety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation  however we often work on large scale and complex projects  frequently in geographically remote locations 
our project sites can place our employees and others near large equipment  dangerous processes or highly regulated materials  and in challenging environments 
often  we are responsible for safety on the project sites where we work 
many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts  and some of our contract fees or profits are subject to satisfying safety criteria 
unsafe work conditions also have the potential of increasing employee turnover  increasing project costs and raising our operating costs 
if we fail to implement appropriate safety procedures and or if our procedures fail  our employees or others may suffer injuries 
although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to implement effective health  safety and environmental procedures throughout our company  the failure to comply with such procedures  client contracts or applicable regulations could subject us to losses and liability 
other risk factors lawsuits and regulatory proceedings could adversely affect our business 
from time to time  we  our directors and or certain of our current and former officers are named as a party to lawsuits and regulatory proceedings 
a discussion of our material lawsuits appears in note contingencies and commitments included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f although it is not possible at this time to predict the likely outcome of these actions  an adverse result in any of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on us 
litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain 
any claim that is successfully asserted against us could result in significant damage claims and other losses 
even if we were to prevail  any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
for additional information  see note contingencies and commitments and note accounting for claims  unapproved change orders and incentives on long term construction contracts included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f if we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights or if our technology becomes obsolete  our competitive position could be adversely impacted 
we believe that we are an industry leader by owning or having access to our technologies 
we protect our technology positions through patent registrations  license restrictions and a research and development program 
we may not be able to successfully preserve our intellectual property rights in the future  and these rights could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which our services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as us law 
because we license technologies from third parties  there is a risk that our relationships with licensors may terminate or expire or may be interrupted or harmed 
if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights  or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us  our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced 
additionally  if our technologies become obsolete  we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings  and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our clients 
for example  we believe that westinghouse s ap technology is a leading technology for nuclear power generation plants 
however  there are competing technologies  and it is likely that new technologies will be developed in the future 
we also believe that our induction pipe bending technology  know how and capabilities favorably influence our ability to compete successfully 
currently  this technology and our proprietary software are not patented 
even though we have some legal protections against the dissemination of this technology  including non disclosure and confidentiality agreements  our efforts to prevent others from using our technology could be time consuming  expensive and ultimately may be unsuccessful or only partially successful 
finally  there is nothing to prevent our competitors from independently attempting to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technology

see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements and part i  item a risk factors for a discussion of the risks  assumptions and uncertainties affecting these statements 
overview of results and outlook our financial results for fiscal year were adversely impacted by several significant events that occurred during the year 
in the first quarter  a split jury verdict on a project related dispute resulted in a charge of million pre tax million after tax in our power segment  in the third quarter  and subsequent to the earthquakes and tsunami in fukushima  japan  we recorded an impairment of million million after tax on loans made to a project developer on a proposed nuclear power project in texas under our agreement with toshiba to jointly work on abwr technology based projects  during the year we recorded write downs amounting to million pre tax after tax resulting primarily from cost increases and schedule delays on a major ethylene project being executed by our e c segment in asia  in the fourth quarter we reversed approximately million pretax million after tax in contract profit on an epc coal project in the us for cost increases from quantity growth and resultant construction labor cost increases  and the rise of the japanese yen versus the us dollar resulted in a million pre tax after tax in non cash foreign exchange translation losses on the jpy denominated westinghouse bonds 
these events overshadowed the strong operational performance in our e i  plant services  and f m operating segments 
cash flow from operations amounted to million and backlog of unfilled orders remained strong at billion 
in addition to the impact from the adverse jury verdict noted above  our power segment s financial results reflect decreased activity in our coal and air quality control projects as several reached substantial completion in fiscal year partially offsetting this decrease is increased activity on our domestic ap nuclear power projects as well as continued execution of epc projects for three coal fired and three gas fired power plants  one of which was completed during the segment s results also benefited from power uprate and lifecycle extension projects at existing nuclear facilities and a million pre tax favorable arbitration settlement in taiwan 
this segment s backlog of unfilled orders remains strong at approximately billion 
our plant services segment achieved an increase in revenues and a significant increase in profit as well as income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities of million and record ebitda of million in fiscal year the segment benefited from a greater number and longer duration of fueling outages at us nuclear power plants for new and existing clients 
this segment continues to successfully book new work and had its backlog of unfilled orders increase million  or  to billion during fiscal year our e i segment performed well during but generated less revenue and earnings compared to fiscal year  primarily driven by decreased activity on our hurricane protection project in louisiana as work nears completion 
this decrease was partially offset by our long term mox project for the doe in south carolina 
e i s backlog of unfilled orders remained strong at approximately billion 
our e c segment experienced reduced revenues and generated a significant operating loss in fiscal year  primarily from forecasted cost increases on a major international project noted above and from a decline in new awards 
e c s backlog of unfilled orders declined million  or  to million during fiscal year we are in the process of evaluating strategic alternatives for our e c business 
we have received a number of indications of interest from potential acquirers and are exploring our options relating to this business 
we can provide no assurance whether a transaction with our e c business might be consummated or on what terms  such a transaction would significantly impact our financial position 
similarly  our f m segment experienced reduced revenues and operating profits in fiscal year the decrease is primarily due to a decline in new awards during fiscal years and originating from the oil refining and petrochemical industries  and from an approximate million pre tax adverse settlement of a dispute with a client 
the decline in new orders is expected to be largely offset in the future by increases in work performed at the new modular assembly facility relating to the nuclear power plants our power segment is executing in georgia and south carolina and from revenues to come from the pipe fabrication facility currently under construction in the uae 
f m s backlog of unfilled orders increased million  or  during to billion 
the financial results of our investment in westinghouse segment continue to be negatively impacted by significant non operating foreign exchange translation losses on our jpy denominated westinghouse bonds 
the translation loss occurs when the jpy appreciates against the usd 
in fiscal years and  we recorded pre tax losses of million and million  respectively  related to foreign currency translation losses on the jpy denominated bonds 
the exchange rate of the jpy to the us dollar at august  was as compared to as of august  on september   our wholly owned subsidiary nuclear energy holdings announced its intention to seek the consent of the trustee acting on behalf of the holders of the yen denominated westinghouse bonds to exercise the put options it received in connection with its acquisition of percent of the shares of the westinghouse group 
if the necessary consents are obtained  nuclear energy holdings formally will notify toshiba in accordance with the terms of the put options  and the shares will transfer days thereafter 
the funds received must be applied toward the redemption of the bonds on the next scheduled interest payment date 
if consents to redeem the bonds early are not granted  the put options will be exercised automatically on october   for cash settlement on january  proceeds from the sale must be used to repay the bonds on their scheduled maturity date of march  the exercise of the put option will result in the termination of our cra with wec 
while we believe we have developed a strong working relationship with wec and its majority parent  toshiba  we can provide no assurance as to the level of work we will conduct with wec and or toshiba following the exercise of the put options 
consolidated results of operations the information below is an analysis of our consolidated results for the fiscal years ended august   and in millions  except for percentages 
see segment results of operations below for additional information describing the performance of each of our reportable segments 
revenue for the year ended august  amount in millions change from prior period change from prior period the decrease in consolidated revenues during fiscal year was primarily due to declines in activity in our e c million and e i million segments 
the decline in e c revenues was driven by the continued lack of new awards in and the decline in e i revenues is primarily attributed to decreased cost reimbursable construction activity on a hurricane protection project in louisiana that is nearing completion 
gross profit for the year ended august  amount in millions change from prior period change from prior period consolidated gross profit decreased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to reduced volumes of revenue as well as the million in reduced margins related to forecasted cost increases to complete a major international project in our e c segment and reversed contract profit on an epc coal project in the us for cost increases from quantity growth and resultant construction labor cost of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the year ended august  amount in millions change from prior period change from prior period consolidated sg a decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to reductions in staffing costs 
impairment of note receivable for the year ended august  amount in millions change from prior period change from prior period during the first quarter of fiscal year  in connection with a global alliance with toshiba  shaw committed to fund million in support of abwr nuclear power related projects 
the first million was made available as a secured credit facility to the entity developing abwr nuclear power plant reactors for the south texas projects and at may  and subsequent to the earthquakes and tsunami in fukushima  japan  we had advanced approximately million under this credit facility 
during the three months ended may   the project sponsor asked that we cease the majority of the work relating to individual orders issued under our epc contract jointly obtained with toshiba 
additionally  the project sponsors majority owner announced it was withdrawing from further financial participation in that company  and a major municipal utility announced it would indefinitely suspend all discussions regarding a potential agreement to purchase the power from the proposed facilities 
due to these changes  we reviewed the security supporting the loans outstanding primarily partially manufactured equipment and we wrote off loans granted to the project entities totaling million 
we do not plan to make additional investments in abwr related projects 
interest expense for the year ended august  amount in millions change from prior period change from prior period consolidated interest expense increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due primarily to the interest expense associated with the jpy denominated bonds  which increased  when expressed in us dollar terms  by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the actual interest expense is paid in a fixed amount of jpy but the us dollar equivalent varies according to the jpy us dollar exchange rate 
benefit provision for income taxes for the year ended august  amount in millions change from prior period change from prior period consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal year was a benefit of as compared to a provision of for fiscal year the change in our effective tax rate was primarily due the level and mix of earnings between our domestic and international operations 
see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the consolidated effective tax rate 
earnings losses from unconsolidated entities for the year ended august  amount in millions change from prior period change from prior period earnings from unconsolidated entities increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to a million net of tax increase in earnings from our investment in westinghouse 
net income loss attributable to shaw for the year ended august  amount in millions change from prior period change from prior period the decrease in consolidated net income loss attributable to shaw in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was related to the factors discussed above and an increase in the pre tax non cash foreign currency translation loss on the westinghouse bonds of million in fiscal year segment results of operations the following tables compare selected summary financial information related to our segments for the fiscal years ended august    and in millions  except for percentages fiscal year ended august  revenues power plant services e i e c f m corporate total revenues gross profit power plant services e i e c f m corporate total gross profit gross profit percentage power plant services e i e c f m corporate nm nm nm total gross profit percentage selling  general and administrative expenses power plant services e i e c f m investment in westinghouse corporate total selling  general and administrative expenses income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities power plant services e i e c f m investment in westinghouse corporate total income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities nm not meaningful 
our revenues by industry were as follows in millions  except for percentages fiscal year ended august  amount amount amount environmental and infrastructure power generation chemicals other total revenues our revenues by geographic region generally based on the site location of the project were as follows in millions  except for percentages fiscal year ended august  amount amount amount united states asia pacific rim countries middle east united kingdom and other european countries south america and mexico canada other total revenues segment analysis fiscal year compared to fiscal year power segment our power segment continued executing major electric power generation projects across the globe 
work continues on three major epc coal fired power plants in the us  but activity on two contracts for four domestic ap nuclear units continues to increase and is becoming a more significant component of this segment s revenues 
work also continues on our services contract for four new ap nuclear power reactors in china 
we expect to continue to see reduced activity for future new build coal fired power plants as the market interest in these type projects has significantly declined 
we believe there are significant opportunities for aqc related projects but these are dependent on finalizing pending air emission regulations in the us 
interest in new build nuclear power plants and uprates on existing nuclear power plants was strong prior to the earthquakes  tsunami and subsequent damage to several of japan s nuclear reactors 
it is too early to determine the long term impact of these events on new build nuclear power and uprate power markets  but our existing clients in the us and china have stated their intentions to continue execution of existing contracts 
revenues revenues decreased million  or  to  million in fiscal year from  million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to the substantial completion of several coal and aqc projects in fiscal year of million  lower volume on continuing epc coal projects of million and an adverse jury verdict on a dispute that resulted in a reduction in revenue of million compared to fiscal year this decrease was partially offset by volume increases of million on our domestic ap nuclear reactors  nuclear uprate projects  new build gas fired power plants and other contracts  as well as a million favorable arbitration award in taiwan 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  and gross profit percentage decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decrease in gross profit and gross profit percentage was due to an adverse jury verdict that resulted in a reduction in gross profit of million and reduced margin totaling million related to cost increases on a new build coal project 
additionally  the substantial completion of several coal and aqc epc projects in fiscal year contributed million to the year over year reduction in gross profit 
partially offsetting these decreases were increased gross profit of million on on going new build coal and gas fired epc contracts as well as increased gross profit on domestic nuclear epc projects  nuclear uprate projects and other contracts 
additionally  gross profit increased million as a result of a favorable arbitration award in taiwan 
income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes and earnings from unconsolidated entities decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease primarily resulted from the same factors affecting gross profit discussed above  partially offset by a decrease in sg a in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year plant services segment our plant services segment generated increased revenue and record earnings in fiscal year compared to fiscal year these increases were driven primarily by projects for nuclear power plant refueling outages as well as growth in profitability of our industrial maintenance business line  including performing maintenance services for several new customers 
partially offsetting the increase in revenue and profits was a decline in the volume of construction projects due to an overall decline in client capital spending and significant competition 
revenues revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily attributable to increased revenues in the industrial maintenance business line as we have expanded our services to new customers and new markets 
in addition  the nuclear power plant maintenance business also experienced revenue growth in fiscal year partially offsetting this growth was a decline in the volume of construction work as compared to the prior fiscal year 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and gross profit percentage increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increases in gross profit and gross profit percentage were primarily due to execution in the nuclear maintenance market of both outage and on line services as well as the continuation of a major project in the industrial maintenance business line 
income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes and earnings from unconsolidated entities increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase primarily resulted from the same factors affecting gross profit discussed above offset by a minimal increase in general and administrative expenses 
e i segment our e i segment continues to produce profitable results even with decreased construction activity on our hurricane protection project  which is substantially complete 
our long term mox project for the doe in south carolina will continue to be a significant contributor to our results as well as our existing projects for our government and private sector customers  which provide environmental remediation  program management  emergency response and recovery  facility management and infrastructure services 
revenues revenues decreased million  or  to  million in fiscal year from  million in fiscal year primarily due to decreased construction activity on the hurricane protection project for the usace in southeast louisiana and a previously consolidated joint venture that completed execution of a project for the doe in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the decrease was partially offset by our mox project for the doe  a design build project for the us navy  also substantially complete  and remediation activities relating to the fukushima  japan nuclear reactors 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year while gross profit percentage increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decrease in gross profit is primarily due to decreased activity from our hurricane protection project for the usace partially offset by increased activity on our design build project for the us navy and profit earned on projects with a favorable contract mix in fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit percentage was due to the favorable contract mix in fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year  in part from our having no activity from a previously consolidated lower margin joint venture that completed execution of the cost reimbursable project for the doe described above 
income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes and earnings from unconsolidated entities decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease primarily resulted from the same factors affecting gross profit discussed above as well as a slight increase in selling  general and administrative expenses related to increased business development activities 
e c segment our e c segment experienced significant forecast cost increases of approximately million on a major international project during the fiscal year 
additionally  this segment continues to suffer from reduced quantity of bookings of new contracts that occurred throughout fiscal years and revenues revenues decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from  million in fiscal year due primarily to decreased revenue associated with an international project as a result of significant forecasted cost increases  reduced engineering services and procurement contracts from the prior year and a reduction in customer furnished materials and pass through revenues of million for which we recognize no gross profit or loss 
customer furnished materials and pass through costs were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year gross profit percentage decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decreases in gross profit and gross profit percentage were primarily due to the work off of several high margin engineering services and procurement contracts in fiscal year as well as million in reduced margin related to forecasted cost increases to complete a major international project 
income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes and earnings from unconsolidated entities decreased million  or  to a loss of million in fiscal year  compared to income of million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to the factors affecting gross profit discussed above 
f m segment our f m segment experienced an expected decline in volume and profits for fiscal year as a result of reduced amounts of non nuclear bookings of new contracts through the prior fiscal year and because work associated with the ap work subcontracted from our power segment has yet to significantly impact revenues and earnings 
a settlement of a client dispute in the fourth quarter of fy also decreased earnings 
we expect this downturn in volume and profits to subsequently improve in fiscal year to the extent that our nuclear modular assembly activity accelerates 
revenues revenues decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease was due to the completion of several large projects in the prior fiscal year which were not replaced in backlog and bending machine sales in fiscal year that did not occur in gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year gross profit percentage decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decreases in gross profit and gross profit percentage were primarily due to reduced client demand for pipe fabrication services overall and from a million pre tax adverse settlement of a dispute with a client 
income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes and earnings from unconsolidated entities decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year primarily due to the factors affecting gross profit discussed above 
investment in westinghouse segment the results of our investment in westinghouse segment include both our interest in westinghouse s reported earnings loss  and the gain loss on translating the jpy denominated westinghouse bonds used to partially fund the investment in westinghouse in october through our subsidiary  neh to the usd equivalent at the end of each fiscal period 
for fiscal years and  the impact of the investment in westinghouse segment on our income loss before income taxes was and  respectively 
because the westinghouse bonds are denominated in jpy  at the end of each fiscal period  gaap requires that we revalue for financial reporting purposes the jpy denominated westinghouse bond debt to its usd equivalent at the jpy us dollar exchange rate in effect at the end of each fiscal period  with the difference being recognized as a non cash gain or loss in our statement of operations for that fiscal period 
the losses in fiscal years and were primarily attributable to the non cash foreign currency translation losses of million and million  respectively  resulting from revaluing the jpy denominated westinghouse bonds to the usd equivalent at the end of the fiscal period 
as a result of the westinghouse bond holders having the ability to require us to exercise the put option to retire the bonds due to the toshiba event described previously  we reclassified the westinghouse bonds from long term to current liabilities in the third quarter of fiscal year additionally  we contemporaneously expensed a pre tax total of approximately million in interest expense  which included the million in pre tax unamortized original issuance bond discount as well as the million in unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the westinghouse bonds 
see item business for additional information 
our interest in westinghouse s earnings was million in fiscal year  an increase from million in fiscal year this increase was related to increases in revenues and operation profits in its nuclear services and nuclear fuel segments 
westinghouse maintains its accounting records for reporting to its majority owner  toshiba  on a calendar quarter basis with a march fiscal year end 
financial information about westinghouse s operations is available to us for westinghouse s calendar quarter periods 
as a result  we record our of westinghouse s earnings loss as reported to us by westinghouse based upon westinghouse s calendar quarterly reporting periods  or two months in arrears of our current reporting periods 
under this policy  the results of westinghouse s operations from july   through their calendar quarter ended june   were included in our financial statements for the twelve months ended august   and the results of westinghouse s operations from july   through their calendar quarter ended june   were included in our financial statements for the twelve months ended august  as noted previously  the westinghouse bonds are jpy denominated 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the impact of exchange rate changes on our jpy denominated cash interest payments on the westinghouse bonds 
we normally focus our hedge transactions to the jpy interest payments due within the following twelve months 
on september   neh announced that it intends to exercise its put options to sell the westinghouse equity to toshiba which could also result in the retirement of the westinghouse bonds 
corporate corporate sg a expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease was due primarily to lower compensation and severance costs  professional fees and non income related taxes  partially offset by higher repairs and maintenance expenses associated with our corporate aircraft  charitable contributions and depreciation expense 
segment analysis fiscal year compared to fiscal year power segment our power segment continued executing major electric power generation projects across the globe during fiscal year the segment s activity increased on two contracts for four domestic ap nuclear units and two domestic new build gas fired plants 
additionally  work continues on our services contract for four new ap nuclear power reactors in china 
however  reduced demand for electricity in the us and uncertainty regarding air emission regulations in the us contributed to a decline in our coal and air quality control businesses where we saw substantially reduced activities  opportunities and new awards throughout fiscal year revenues revenues decreased million  or  to  million in fiscal year from  million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to the significant decline in volume in our aqc and coal business lines attributable to the substantial completion of several large projects in fiscal year when aggregated  the reduced activity on those projects resulted in decreased revenue of approximately million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this decrease was partially offset by increased volume on two contracts for four domestic ap nuclear reactors  two new build gas fired power plants  and our services contract for four new ap nuclear power reactors in china representing approximately million in increased revenue in fiscal year compared to fiscal year gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  and gross profit percentage increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increases in gross profit and gross profit percentage were due to increased activity in fiscal year on domestic ap contracts and increased profitability in our coal business lines which  when aggregated  added million in gross profit in fiscal year compared to fiscal year additionally  we have made progress in achieving price certainty on a number of key commodities  which resulted in reductions to our estimated cost at completion on a number of contracts 
in fiscal year  we reported significantly increased estimated costs to complete two coal fired power plant projects  one of which amounted to million 
higher legal costs and reduced volumes in our aqc business line in fiscal year partially offset the increases in gross profit described previously 
income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes and earnings from unconsolidated entities increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this increase primarily resulted from the same factors affecting gross profit discussed above  as well as a slight decrease in the segment s general and administrative expenses in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year plant services segment our plant services segment generated increased revenue and profitability in fiscal year compared to fiscal year these increases were driven primarily by projects for nuclear power plant refueling outages for new and existing clients 
partially offsetting the increase in revenue and profits was a decline in the volume of construction projects due to an overall decline in client capital spending and significant competition in the process and industrial markets 
revenues revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increases were primarily attributable to a greater number and longer duration of nuclear power plant refueling outages for new and existing clients of approximately million 
a decline in the volume of smaller project awards partially offset increased revenues in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year resulting from an overall decline in overall construction spending and significant competition in the process and industrial markets 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and gross profit percentage increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increases in gross profit and gross profit percentage were primarily due to the increased number and length of nuclear refueling outages in fiscal year as well as a reduction of indirect expenses of approximately million compared to fiscal year fiscal year s gross profit and gross profit percentage were negatively impacted in the second quarter of fiscal by the resolution of a dispute with the owner of a major domestic power project 
income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes and earnings from unconsolidated entities increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase primarily resulted from the same factors affecting gross profit discussed above as well as lower general and administrative expenses 
e i segment our e i segment s revenues and profitability increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year these increases were driven primarily by our activities on our hurricane protection project for the usace in southeast louisiana  construction services for the temporary sand berms off the coast of louisiana and our mox project for the doe in south carolina 
revenues revenues increased million  or  to  million in fiscal year from  million in fiscal year primarily due to increased volumes of services provided to the us government  led by increased construction activity on the hurricane protection project for the usace  the temporary sand berm construction and our mox project 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year while gross profit percentage increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in gross profit is primarily due to activity on a hurricane protection  sand berm and mox projects noted above 
gross profit and gross profit percentage also increased due to the overall volume increases and lower overhead costs as a percentage of revenue as compared to the prior fiscal year 
income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes and earnings from unconsolidated entities increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase primarily resulted from the same factors affecting gross profit discussed above 
e c segment as anticipated  our e c segment results were adversely impacted by the current economic climate resulting in lower revenues and earnings in fiscal year as compared to the record levels in the fiscal year revenues for e c decreased from fiscal year primarily due to reduced volumes of customer furnished materials and reimbursable costs which are invoiced to clients without profit and reduced revenues from engineering projects as a result of decreased new work awards 
revenues revenues decreased million  or  to  million in fiscal year from  million in fiscal year due primarily to a decrease of approximately million in the volume of reimbursable customer furnished materials for which we recognize no gross profit or loss and a decline in engineering services projects due to lack of new awards 
partially offsetting these decreases was increased volume on a major international ethylene project in asia 
the reduced margin was most prevalent during the fourth quarter of fiscal year when field costs increased on the international ethylene project 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year gross profit percentage decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decrease in gross profit is due to the lower volume of engineering contracts in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the decrease in gross profit percentage is a result of lower volumes of higher margin engineering projects and increased revenue from our major international ethylene project in asia which has a lower gross margin percentage than our engineering projects 
income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes and earnings from unconsolidated entities decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to the factors affecting gross profit discussed above 
f m segment our f m segment experienced decreased business volumes in fiscal from the record levels in fiscal year the global economic downturn negatively impacted our end markets  particularly clients in the oil refining and chemical petrochemical industries with many projects being delayed into fiscal as a result  our non nuclear bookings and profits declined in fiscal we expect the downturn in volume and profits to continue into the first half of fiscal year but subsequently to improve to the extent that the modular assembly and pipe fabrication work associated with the ap work subcontracted from our power segment commences 
revenues revenues decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease was due to lower volumes resulting from lower bookings across the majority of our us operations as a result of global economic environment partially offset by higher revenues in our mexican operations 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year gross profit percentage decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decrease in gross profit and gross profit percentage was primarily due to reduced client demand for pipe fabrication services  a more competitive pricing environment and the completion of higher margin contracts in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes and earnings from unconsolidated entities decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year primarily due to the factors affecting gross profit discussed above 
investment in westinghouse segment the results of our investment in westinghouse segment include both our interest in westinghouse s reported earnings loss  and the gain loss on translating the jpy denominated westinghouse bonds used to partially fund the investment in westinghouse in october through our subsidiary  neh to the usd equivalent at the end of each fiscal period 
for fiscal years and  we incurred pre tax losses of million and million in our investment in westinghouse segment 
these results do not include any westinghouse dividends 
because the westinghouse bonds are denominated in jpy  at the end of each fiscal period  gaap requires that we revalue for financial reporting purposes the jpy denominated westinghouse bond debt to its usd equivalent at the jpy us dollar exchange rate in effect at the end of each fiscal period  with the difference being recognized as a non cash gain or loss in our statement of operations for that fiscal period 
the losses in fiscal years and were primarily attributable to the non cash foreign currency translation losses of million and million  respectively  resulting from revaluing the jpy denominated westinghouse bonds to the usd equivalent at the end of the fiscal period 
as a result of the westinghouse bond holders having the ability to require us to exercise the put option to retire the bonds due to the toshiba event described previously  we reclassified the westinghouse bonds from long term to current liabilities in the third quarter of fiscal year additionally  we were required to expense a pre tax total of million in as interest expense  which included the million in pre tax unamortized original issuance bond discount as well as the million in unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the westinghouse bonds 
see item business for additional information 
our interest in westinghouse s earnings increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this increase was related to increases in revenues and operation profits in its nuclear services and nuclear power plants segments 
westinghouse maintains its accounting records for reporting to its majority owner  toshiba  on a calendar quarter basis with a march fiscal year end 
financial information about westinghouse s operations is available to us for westinghouse s calendar quarter periods 
as a result  we record our of westinghouse s earnings loss as reported to us by westinghouse based upon westinghouse s calendar quarterly reporting periods  or two months in arrears of our current reporting periods 
under this policy  the results of westinghouse s operations from july   through their calendar quarter ended june   were included in our financial statements for the twelve months ended august   and the results of westinghouse s operations from july   through their calendar quarter ended june   were included in our financial statements for the twelve months ended august  as noted previously  the westinghouse bonds are jpy denominated 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the impact of exchange rate changes on our jpy denominated cash interest payments on the westinghouse bonds 
we normally focus our hedge transactions to the jpy interest payments due within the following twelve months 
on september   neh announced that it intends to exercise its put options to sell the westinghouse equity to toshiba  the ultimate result of which could be the retirement of the westinghouse bonds 
corporate corporate sg a expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease was due primarily to the successful remediation of material weaknesses in fiscal year resulting in lower professional fees in the current fiscal year  lower non income related tax expenses in fiscal year  and lower compensation costs 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in health insurance costs 
non gaap financial measure ebitda is a supplemental  non gaap financial measure and is a measure of operating performance used internally 
ebitda is defined as earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we have presented ebitda because it is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in similar businesses 
we believe that the line item on our consolidated statements of operations entitled income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ebitda 
since ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  it should not be considered in isolation of  or as a substitute for  income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities as an indicator of operating performance 
ebitda  as we calculate it  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
in addition  this measure is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs 
as ebitda excludes certain financial information as compared with income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  users of this financial information should consider the type of events and transactions which are excluded 
our non gaap performance measure  ebitda  has certain material limitations as follows it does not include interest expense 
because we have borrowed money to finance our operations  pay commitment fees to maintain our credit facility  and incur fees to issue letters of credit under the credit facility  interest expense is a necessary and ongoing part of our costs and has assisted us in generating revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations 
it does not include income taxes 
because the payment of income taxes is a necessary and ongoing part of our operations  any measure that excludes income taxes has material limitations 
it does not include depreciation or amortization expense 
because we use capital and intangible assets to generate revenue  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our cost structure 
therefore  any measure that excludes depreciation or amortization expense has material limitations 
a reconciliation of ebitda to income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities is shown below in millions fiscal year ended august  consolidated power plant services e i e c f m westinghouse corporate income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities interest expense depreciation and amortization earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income attributable to noncontrolling interests ebitda fiscal year ended august  consolidated power plant services e i e c f m westinghouse corporate income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities interest expense depreciation and amortization earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income attributable to noncontrolling interests ebitda fiscal year ended august  consolidated power plant services e i e c f m westinghouse corporate income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities interest expense depreciation and amortization earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income attributable to noncontrolling interests ebitda liquidity and capital resources liquidity we generated million in positive operating cash flow during  and at august   our cash and cash equivalents  restricted and escrowed cash and cash equivalents  and unrestricted and restricted short term investments totaled  million a decrease of million  or  from  million at august  
during  we utilized million to repurchase our shares in the open market and to a much lesser extent from employees to satisfy tax withholdings on long term incentive compensation transactions 
in addition to our cash and cash equivalents  the maximum amount that could be available under our facility for revolving credit at august  was  million 
because we have voluntarily pledged million of our cash as collateral for letters of credit or in lieu of letters of credit  and because  to access such cash  we would need to provide new letters of credit from our facility  we viewed the maximum amounts that could be available under our facility as august   as approximately million 
however  the actual amounts available under the facility for borrowing or the issuance of financial letters of credit can be restricted by other covenants defined within the facility  the most restrictive being the maximum leverage ratio which at august  allowed for million of actual borrowing or financial letter of credit availability under the facility 
cash flow the following table sets forth the cash flows for the last three years in millions year ended august  cash flow provided by used in operating activities cash flow provided by used in investing activities cash flow provided by used in financing activities effects of foreign exchange rate changes on cash operating activities we generated million in operating cash flows during fiscal year our power  plant services  e i and f m segments provided cash from operations  primarily as a result of the earnings in those segments and positive working capital movements on contracts within our power segment 
also contributing to our positive operating cash flow was the million in dividends received by our investment in westinghouse segment 
the positive cash flow from operations was partially offset by the reversal of favorable working capital positions on certain e c and power projects and the cash used from operations of our e c  corporate  and investment in westinghouse segments 
in fiscal year  we generated million in operating cash flows primarily as a result of earnings generated from our operating segments  positive working capital movements and approximately million in dividends received from our investment in westinghouse 
the primary contributors of this positive operating cash flow were our power and e i segments 
in fiscal year  we generated record cash flow of million  primarily attributable to earnings from all our operating segments as well as positive working capital movements 
the largest contributors to this positive operating cash flow were from our power and f m segments 
our operating cash flow is generated primarily by earnings and working capital movements of our projects 
our primary source of operating cash inflows is collections of our accounts receivable ar  which are generally invoiced based upon achieving performance milestones prescribed in our contracts 
our outstanding ar and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings cie are reviewed monthly and tend to be due from high quality credit clients such as regulated utilities  us government agencies  multinational oil companies and industrial corporations and merchant power producers 
because our clients tend to have the financial resources sufficient to honor their contractual obligations  we believe our ar and cie are collectible 
the timing of the milestone billings on fixed priced contracts varies with each milestone within each contract but generally are invoiced within several months of first incurring costs associated with the prescribed work 
working capital movements on fixed price contracts are based on the timing of our completion of the specified performance milestones 
generally  working capital movements are positive in the early phases of the fixed price contracts and can be negative in the later phases as the cash balances decline to equal earnings 
if new fixed priced projects are not booked with positive working capital terms to replace contracts in the latter phases of execution  our net working capital movement tends to be negative 
for cost reimbursable contacts  we generally seek to bill and collect payments in advance of incurring project costs 
however  cost reimbursable contracts with the us government provide for billings in the month subsequent to incurring the costs 
our ar and cie were and of current assets at august  and  respectively 
at august   approximately of our cie reflects costs from contracts being executed for the us government  which we expect to invoice and collect in the normal course of business 
see note accounts receivable  concentrations of credit risk  and inventories and note accounting for claims  unapproved change orders and incentives on long term construction contracts to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f for additional information with respect to these working capital items 
our cash position has created opportunities for us to obtain market discounts and provide protection from potential future price escalation for our epc projects by undertaking an early procurement program 
accordingly  we have begun to procure certain commodities  subcontracts and construction equipment early in the life cycle of major projects 
this strategy was partially implemented in fiscal year and continued in fiscal year this strategy is intended to provide price and schedule certainty but requires that we expend some of our cash earlier than originally estimated under the contracts 
during the year ended august   and  respectively  we expended approximately million and million under the early procurement program 
it is our intent to balance any potential cancellation exposure associated with early procurements with our termination rights and obligations under the respective prime contracts with our clients and to help protect ourselves from suppliers failing to perform by requiring financial security instruments to support their performance 
however  we can provide no assurance that our intent to manage our cancellation exposure will be successful 
in addition  we currently intend to pursue additional early procurements opportunities during fiscal year in march and november  we made voluntary cash contributions to underfunded pension plans in the united kingdom totaling million approximately million and million approximately million  respectively 
investing activities cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal year  compared to cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal year while we continue to invest a portion of our excess cash to support the growth of our business lines  our capital expenditures decreased in fiscal year from fiscal year  primarily due to the completion of the construction of our module fabrication and assembly facility in lake charles  louisiana in fiscal year cash used for acquisition purposes during fiscal year consisted of a net price of million for our purchase of the remaining of a joint venture engineering company in india during the second quarter and million  net of cash acquired  for our purchase of of the outstanding stock of cpe during the third quarter 
during fiscal year  we also received a net return of cash used to collateralize standby letters of credit of approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to our use of million for restricted and escrowed cash and cash equivalents and restricted short term investments in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year offset by million used for the purchase of property in equipment in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year during fiscal year  our investing activities also included a return of investment from westinghouse of approximately million 
in addition  in fiscal year we increased the cash pledged  at our option  to secure certain outstanding letters of credit issued to support our project execution activities to million from million in fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal year  in connection with a nuclear abwr global strategic partnership agreement between shaw and toshiba  shaw committed to invest million for an abwr alliance with toshiba  million of which was made available as a secured credit facility to the entity sponsoring to assist in financing the development of the planned abwr nuclear power plant reactors for the south texas projects and the credit facility was intended to convert to equity in the project s sponsor upon the satisfaction of certain conditions  including the project receiving full notice to proceed 
at may   we had advanced approximately million under this credit facility 
during the three months ended may   the project sponsor asked that we cease the majority of the work relating to individual orders issued under our epc contract jointly obtained with toshiba 
additionally  the project sponsors majority owner announced it was withdrawing from further financial participation in that company  and a major municipal utility announced it would indefinitely suspend all discussions regarding a potential agreement to purchase the power from the proposed facilities 
due to these changes  we reviewed the security supporting the loans outstanding primarily partially manufactured equipment and we wrote off loans granted to the project entities totaling million during our fiscal third quarter 
we do not plan to make additional investments in abwr related projects 
financing activities cash used in financing activities for fiscal year totaled million and included million used to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock under the share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in december and million used to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock under the share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in june the million stock repurchase program completed by the company in may was accomplished under the provisions of the previous agreement and therefore does not reduce any availability under the current restated credit agreement to acquire or retire any of our capital stock 
see note debt and revolving lines of credit included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f for a description of the limitations on our ability to acquire or retire our capital stock 
in addition  we used million for distributions to noncontrolling shareholders of several of our consolidated joint ventures net cash flows used in financing activities decreased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to the an increase in the repayment of debt and leases offset by an increase in the issuance of common stock and the excess tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options and or the vesting of restricted stock awards 
see note share based compensation to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f for additional information about our stock compensation plans 
many of our clients require that we issue letters of credit or surety bonds for work we perform 
our growth may be dependent on our ability to access and possibly increase our letter of credit and surety bonding capacity  our ability to achieve timely release of existing letters of credit and surety bonds and or our ability to obtain from our clients more favorable terms reducing letter of credit and surety requirements on new work 
our need for letter of credit capacity may increase as we seek additional construction projects 
increases in outstanding performance letters of credit issued under our facility reduce the available borrowing capacity under our facility 
capital resources over the past three years  we have generated significant operating cash flow and currently have in excess of billion of cash and short term marketable securities 
our excess cash is generally invested in money market funds comprised predominately of us treasury obligations and securities  money market funds governed under rule a of the us investment company act of and rated aaa aaa by s p and or moody  respectively  interest bearing deposit accounts with commercial banks rated at least a a or better by s p and or moody  respectively or publicly traded debt rated at least a a or better by s p and or moody  respectively  with maturities up to two years at the time of purchase 
as concerns about financial investments in europe continued to rise  we elected subsequent to our fiscal year end to re allocate several short term investments  including some cash voluntarily pledged as collateral for letters of credit  to investments focused more in north america and asia 
all of our short term investments are placed in accordance with our internal policies 
approximately million of our cash at august   was held internationally for international operations 
the majority of this amount is associated with earnings in subsidiaries that we consider indefinitely invested 
we have the ability to return certain amounts of our overseas funds to the us but may incur incremental taxes under certain circumstances 
we expect to fund our operations for the next twelve months through the use of cash generated from operations and existing cash balances 
however  there can be no assurance that we will achieve our forecasted cash flow  which could result in new borrowings under existing or future credit facilities 
credit facility on june   we entered into an unsecured second amended and restated credit agreement facility with a group of lenders that provides lender commitments of up to  million under the facility  all of which may be available for the issuance of performance letters of credit 
of the  million in commitments  a sublimit of  million may be available for the issuance of financial letters of credit and or borrowings for working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
the restated credit agreement releases all collateral securing the previous credit agreement and contains an expiration of commitments on june  the restated credit agreement continues to require guarantees by the company s material domestic subsidiaries 
during fiscal year  no borrowings were made under our previous credit facility and none have been made through the date of this filing under the restated credit agreement  however  we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million as of august   and those letters of credit reduce what is otherwise available under our facility 
at august   we were in compliance with the covenants contained in our restated credit agreement

see note debt and revolving lines of credit included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f for additional information 
off balance sheet arrangements on a limited basis  performance assurances are extended to clients that guarantee certain performance measurements upon completion of a project 
if performance assurances are extended to clients  generally our maximum potential exposure is the remaining cost of the work to be performed under engineering and construction contracts with potential recovery from third party vendors and subcontractors for work performed in the ordinary course of contract execution 
as a result  the total costs of the project could exceed our original cost estimates and we could experience reduced gross profit or possibly a loss for that project 
in some cases  where we fail to meet certain performance standards  we may be subject to contractual liquidated damages 
commercial commitments our lenders issue letters of credit on our behalf to clients  sureties and to secure other financial obligations in connection with our contract performance and in limited circumstances on certain other obligations of third parties 
if drawn  we are required to reimburse our lenders for payments on these letters of credit 
at august   we had both letter of credit commitments and surety bonding obligations  which were generally issued to secure performance and financial obligations on certain of our construction contracts  which expire as follows in millions amounts of commitment expiration by period commercial commitments total less than year years years after years letters of credit domestic and foreign surety bonds total commercial commitments commercial commitments exclude any letters of credit or bonding obligations associated with outstanding bids or proposals or other work not awarded prior to september  of the amount of outstanding letters of credit at august   million were issued to clients in connection with contracts performance letters of credit 
of the million  five clients held million or of the outstanding letters of credit 
the largest aggregate amount of letters of credit issued and outstanding at august   to a single client on a single project is million 
our ability to borrow under our facility is reduced by the dollar value of the letters of credit we have outstanding 
at august  and august   we had total surety bonds of million and million  respectively 
however  based on our percentage of completion on contracts covered by these surety bonds  our estimated potential liability at august  and august   was million and million  respectively 
fees related to these commercial commitments were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year for a discussion of long term debt and a discussion of contingencies and commitments  see note debt and revolving lines of credit and note contingencies and commitments  respectively  included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f aggregate contractual obligations as of august  we had the following contractual obligations in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt obligations a capital lease obligations interest rate swap b operating lease obligations purchase obligations c pension obligations d total contractual cash obligations a amounts for long term debt obligations represent both principal and interest payments

backlog of unfilled orders general 
our backlog represents management s estimate of future revenues expected to be realized from contracts awarded to us by clients 
backlog is estimated using legally binding agreements for projects that management believes are likely to proceed 
management evaluates the potential backlog value of each project awarded based upon the nature of the underlying contract  commitment and other factors  including the economic  financial  and regulatory viability of the project and the likelihood of the contract proceeding 
projects in backlog may be increased or decreased for scope change and or may be suspended or cancelled at any time by our clients 
new bookings and ultimately the amount of backlog of unfilled orders is largely a reflection of global economic trends 
the volume of backlog and timing of executing the work in our backlog is important to us in anticipating our operational needs 
backlog is not a measure defined in gaap  and our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog 
we can provide no assurance that revenues projected in our backlog will be realized  or if realized  will result in profits 
all contracts contain client termination for convenience clauses  and many of the contracts in backlog provide for cancellation fees in the event clients cancel projects whether for convenience or a stated cause 
these cancellation fees usually provide for reimbursement of our out of pocket costs  revenues associated with work performed prior to cancellation  and to varying degrees  a percentage of the profits we would have realized had the contract been completed 
the process to add new awards to backlog is generally consistent among our segments and is based on us receiving a legally binding agreement with clients plus management s assessment that the project will likely proceed 
additional details relating to each segment s booking process follows power and e c segments 
we define backlog in our power and e c segments to include projects for which we have received legally binding commitments from our clients 
these commitments typically take the form of a written contract for a specific project or a purchase order  and sometimes require that we estimate anticipated future revenues  often based on engineering and design specifications that have not been finalized and may be revised over time 
the value of work subcontracted to our f m segment is removed from the backlog of the power and e c segments and is shown in the backlog of our f m segment 
plant services segment 
we define backlog in the plant services segment to include projects which are based on legally binding contracts from our clients 
these commitments typically take the form of a written contract or a specific project purchase order and can cover periods ranging from three to five years 
many of these contracts cover reimbursable work to be designated and executed over the term of the agreement 
accordingly  certain of the backlog amounts are based on the underlying contracts purchase orders  our clients historic maintenance requirements  as well as our future cost estimates based on the client s indications of future plant outages 
our plant services segment backlog does not include any awards for work expected to be performed more than five years after the date of our financial statements 
e i segment 
our e i segment s backlog includes the value of awarded contracts including the estimated value of unfunded work and anticipated revenue of consolidated joint venture entities 
the unfunded backlog generally represents us government project awards for which the project funding has been partially authorized or awarded by the relevant government authorities eg  authorization or an award has been provided for only the initial year of a multi year project 
because of appropriation limitations in the us government budget processes  confirmed funding is usually appropriated for only one year at a time and  in some cases  for periods less than one year 
some contracts may contain a number of one year options 
amounts included in backlog are based on the contract s total awarded value and our estimates regarding the amount of the award that will ultimately result in the recognition of revenues 
these estimates may be based on indications provided by our clients of future values  our estimates of the work required to complete the contract  our experience with similar awards and similar clients  and our knowledge and expectations relating to the given award 
the unfunded component of new contract awards is added to backlog at generally no more than of our contract value or our estimated proportionate share of a contract for which there are multiple award recipients 
the programs are monitored  estimates are reviewed periodically  and adjustments are made to the amounts included in backlog and in unexercised contract options to properly reflect our estimate of total contract revenue in the e i segment backlog 
our e i segment backlog does not generally include any awards funded or unfunded for work expected to be performed more than five years after the date of our financial statements 
the executed amendment to the mox contract signed in the third quarter of fiscal extends beyond five years but has defined contract values which differ from many other contracts with government agencies 
accordingly  we included the entire value of the mox contract not yet executed in our backlog of unfilled orders 
the value of work subcontracted to our f m segment is removed from the backlog of our e i segment and is shown in the backlog of our f m segment 
the mox contract value included in the e i segment backlog at august   was billion  with billion funded and billion unfunded 
f m segment 
we define backlog in the f m segment to include projects for which we have received a legally binding commitment from our clients 
these commitments typically take the form of a written contract for a specific project  a purchase order  or a specific indication of the amount of time or material we need to make available for clients anticipated projects under alliance type agreements 
a significant amount of our f m segment s backlog results from inter company awards received from our power  e i  and e c segments 
in such cases  we include the value of the subcontracted work in our f m segment s backlog and exclude it from the corresponding affiliate segment 
at august   and august   our backlog was as follows in millions except for percentages august  by segment amount amount power plant services e i e c f m   total backlog august  by industry amount amount environmental and infrastructure energy chemical other total backlog august  geographic region amount amount domestic international total backlog included in backlog is our share of the full epc contracts for two new ap nuclear reactors to be located in georgia and two new ap nuclear reactors to be located in florida 
not included in our backlog is the majority of the work to be performed on an epc contract for two new ap nuclear reactors to be located in south carolina for which the contract has been awarded  but for which certain client authorizations had not been received at august  during the fiscal quarter ended may   we received notice from our client of a significant delay in the construction schedule for the aforementioned two new ap nuclear reactors to be located in florida relating to early construction activities 
our client advised us that these activities would not be performed for these units until the col is issued by the nuclear regulatory commission for the plant  which we understand is forecast to occur in late as a result  the first reactor is now expected to enter service in  with the second months later 
in the interim  we continue to perform limited engineering and support services and have not removed or altered the corresponding contract value from our backlog as our contract with the client remains in effect 
the amount of revenues and contract profit expected to be generated from this project during fiscal year is likely to be immaterial when considered in relation to our consolidated operations 
we expect to recover any future adverse cost impacts associated with the current schedule delay 
if our client were to cancel the project  we would be entitled to retain all proceeds collected to date  collect any receivables that may be outstanding at that time and be entitled to invoice additional amounts as prescribed under our contract 
the majority of our consolidated backlog is comprised of contracts with regulated electric utility companies  national or international oil companies  and the us government which alone comprises of our e i segment s backlog 
we believe these clients provide us with a stable book of business and possess the financial strength to endure economic challenges 
cancellation of this  or any of our other nuclear projects in backlog would result in a significant reduction of our reported backlog as well as our future earnings 
in addition  if neh is successful in obtaining consent of the trustee to exercise its put option to sell the westinghouse equity to toshiba  the westinghouse cra will terminate upon the exercise of the put option 
if the cra is terminated  we can provide no assurance that we will receive any additional nuclear work from westinghouse  which may have an impact on our results in our power segment 
inflation and changing prices historically  overall inflation and changing prices in the economies in which we perform our services have a minimal effect on our gross profit and our income from continuing operations 
generally  for our long term contract pricing and related cost to complete estimates  we attempt to consider the impact of potential price changes on deliveries of materials and equipment expected to occur in the future 
additionally  for our projects that are reimbursable at cost plus a fee  we generally are reimbursed for all contractual costs including rising costs in an inflationary environment 
certain of our fixed price contracts in our power and e c segments frequently may provide for commodity price adjustments tied to various indices 
however  to the extent we receive cash collections from clients in advance of payments due vendors and subcontractors  we could be exposed to the risks of inflation 
additionally  we may advance purchase materials and equipment to minimize the impacts of potential future inflation 
while these actions are attempts to mitigate inflation risks  there can be no assurance that such actions will be successful 
the epc nuclear contracts currently being executed tend to have longer execution periods than projects we previously executed 
accordingly there can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate inflation risks will be successful

additionally  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk addresses the impact of changes in interest rates on our earnings 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions in the application of certain accounting policies that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included in this form k 
in order to understand better the changes that may occur to key elements of our financial condition and operating results  a reader should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
information regarding our other accounting policies is included in note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the following disclosure 
revenue and profit loss recognition on long term construction accounting including claims  unapproved change orders and incentives our revenues are primarily derived from long term contracts that are reported on the percentage of completion method of accounting in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  construction type and production type contracts 
percentage of completion 
we recognize revenues for long term contracts on the percentage of completion method  primarily based on costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
performance incentives are included in our estimates of revenues using the percentage of completion method when their realization is reasonably assured 
cancellation fees are included in our estimates of revenue using the percentage of completion method when the cancellation notice is received from the client 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which the losses are identified 
the cumulative effect of changes to estimated contract profit and loss  including those arising from contract penalty provisions such as liquidated damages  final contract settlements  warranty claims and reviews of our costs performed by clients  are recognized in the period in which the revisions are identified 
to the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits  we report such a change by recognizing a charge against current earnings  which might be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
for example  our power segment s gross profit for fiscal year was significantly reduced by substantially increased estimated costs to complete two coal fired power plant projects 
unapproved change orders and claims 
revenues and gross profit on contracts can be significantly affected by change orders and claims that may not be ultimately negotiated until the later stages of a contract or subsequent to the date a contract is completed 
we account for unapproved change orders depending on the circumstances 
if it is not probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in contract price  the costs attributable to change orders are treated as contract costs without incremental revenue 
if it is probable that the costs will be recovered through a change order or recovered from a joint venture or consortium partner  the costs are treated as contract costs and contract revenue is recognized to the extent of the costs expected to be incurred 
if it is probable that the contract price will be adjusted by an amount that exceeds the costs attributable to the change order and the amount of the excess can be reliably estimated and realization is assured and supported by a legally binding written communication from the customer  the contract profit is adjusted by the amount of the excess 
when estimating the amount of total gross profit or loss on a contract  we include claims related to our clients as adjustments to revenues and claims related to vendors  subcontractors and others as adjustments to cost of revenues 
including claims in this calculation ultimately increases the gross profit or reduces the loss that would otherwise be recorded without consideration of the claims 
our claims against others are recorded up to costs incurred and include no profit until such time as they are finalized and approved 
the claims included in determining contract gross profit are less than the actual claim that will be or has been presented 
claims are included in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on our consolidated balance sheet 
the costs attributable to change orders and claims being negotiated or disputed with clients  vendors or subcontractors or subject to litigation are included in our estimates of revenues when it is probable they will result in additional contract revenues and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
profit from such unapproved change orders and claims is recorded in the period such amounts are settled or approved 
back charges and claims against and from our vendors  subcontractors and others are included in our cost estimates as a reduction or increase in total estimated costs when recovery or payment of the amounts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
revenue recognition contract segmenting certain of our long term contracts include services performed by more than one operating segment  particularly epc contracts which include pipe  steel  and module fabrication services performed by our f m segment 
we segment revenues  costs and gross profit related to our significant f m subcontracts if they meet the contract segmenting criteria in asc revenues recorded in our f m segment under this policy are based on our prices and terms for such similar services to third party clients and generally include all f m services except module fabrication 
this policy may result in different interim rates of profitability for each segment of the affected epc contract than if we had recognized revenues on a percentage of completion for the entire project based on the combined estimated total costs of all epc and pipe and steel fabrication services 
other revenue recognition and profit and loss estimates for unit priced pipe fabrication contracts  a unit spool consists of piping materials and associated shop labor to form a prefabricated unit according to contract specifications 
spools are generally shipped to job site locations when complete 
we recognize revenues upon shipment of the fabricated spools for a particular unit price fabrication contract 
for fixed price fabrication contracts  we recognize revenues on the units of delivery basis of applying the percentage of completion method  measured primarily by the cost of materials shipped to total estimated costs 
during the fabrication process  all direct and indirect costs related to the fabrication process are capitalized as work in progress inventory 
we recognize revenues for pipe fittings  manufacturing operations and other services at the time of shipment or as services are performed 
revenue is recognized from consulting services as the work is performed 
consulting service work is primarily performed on a cost reimbursable basis 
revenues related to royalty use of our performance enhancements derived from our chemical technologies are recorded in the period earned based on the performance criteria defined in the related contracts 
for running royalty agreements  we recognize revenues based on client production volumes at the contract specified unit rates 
sales of paid up license agreements are coupled with the sale of engineering services for the integration of the technology into the clients processes 
for paid up license agreements  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method  measured primarily by the percentage of costs incurred to date on engineering services to total estimated engineering costs 
under such agreements  revenues available for recognition on a percentage of completion basis are limited to the agreement value less a liability provision for contractually specified process performance guarantees 
the liability provision is recorded in gross profit when  and if  the related performance testing is successfully completed or an assessment indicates a reduction of the liability provision is appropriate 
our approach to estimating liability provisions related to contractual performance guarantees on sales of our technology paid up license agreements requires that we make estimates on the performance of technology on our projects 
our historical experience with performance guarantees on these types of agreements supports estimated liability provisions that vary based on our experience with the different types of technologies for which we license and provide engineering for example  ethylbenzene  styrene  cumene  bisphenol a 
our liability provisions range from nominal amounts up to of the contractual performance guarantee 
if our actual obligations under performance guarantees differ from our estimated liability provisions at the completion of these projects  we will record an increase or decrease in revenues or an increase in costs where we are required to incur costs to remediate a performance deficiency for the difference 
our total estimated performance liability remaining at august  and was million and million  respectively 
the estimated liability provisions generally are more significant as a percentage of the total contract value for these contracts when compared to contracts where we have full epc responsibility  and  as a result  these differences could be material 
for contracts containing multiple deliverables entered into subsequent to june   we analyze each activity within the contract to ensure that we adhere to the separation and revenue recognition guidelines of asc  revenue recognition 
for service only contracts  and service elements of multiple deliverable arrangements  award fees are recognized only when definitized and awarded by the client 
award fees on construction contracts are recognized during the term of the contract based on our estimate of the amount of fees to be awarded 
accounting for governmental contracts most of the services provided to the us government are governed by cost reimbursable contracts 
generally  these contracts contain both a base fee a fixed amount applied to our actual costs to complete the work and an award fee a variable profit percentage applied to definitized costs  which is subject to our client s discretion and tied to the specific performance measures defined in the contract  such as adherence to schedule  health and safety  quality of work  responsiveness  cost performance and business management 
award fees on construction contracts are recognized during the term of the contract based on our estimate of the amount of fees to be awarded 
revenue is recorded at the time services are performed  and such revenues include base fees  actual direct project costs incurred and an allocation of indirect costs 
indirect costs are applied using rates approved by our government clients 
the general  administrative and overhead cost reimbursement rates are estimated periodically in accordance with government contract accounting regulations and may change based on actual costs incurred or based upon the volume of work performed 
revenue is reduced for our estimate of costs that either are in dispute with our client or have been identified as potentially unallowable per the terms of the contract or the federal acquisition regulations 
litigation  commitments and contingencies we are subject to various claims  lawsuits  environmental matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based on professional knowledge and experience of our management and legal counsel 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 
in accordance with asc  contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided on the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets liabilities are established for the difference between the financial reporting basis and the income tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and other tax credits 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we also consider the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment of such realization 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
at august   we had deferred tax assets of million  net of valuation allowance and deferred tax liabilities  including million related to net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
at august   we had a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million

goodwill and intangible assets impairment review in accordance with current accounting guidance  we identified six reporting units for the purpose of conducting our goodwill impairment review 
in determining our reporting units  we considered i whether an operating segment or a component of an operating segment was a business  ii whether discrete financial information was available  and iii whether the financial information is regularly reviewed by management of the operating segment 
to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit in our goodwill impairment review  we utilized the guideline public company method a market approach and the discounted cash flow method an income approach 
the reporting unit s fair value was determined by averaging the resulting fair values calculated under these two methods 
when performing our annual impairment analysis  we also reconcile the total of the fair values of our reporting units with our market capitalization to determine if the sum of the individual fair values is reasonable compared to the external market indicators 
if our reconciliation indicates a significant difference between our external market capitalization and the fair values of our reporting units  we review and adjust  if appropriate  our weighted average cost of capital and consider if the implied control premium is reasonable in light of current market conditions 
the guideline public company method relies on valuation multiples derived from stock prices  financial results and enterprise values from the trailing twelve months of publicly traded companies that are comparable to the subject reporting unit 
the derived valuation multiples are then applied to each reporting unit to develop an estimate of the fair value of the subject reporting unit 
the earnings multiples used in our goodwill impairment review ranged between times and times 
the discounted cash flow method relies upon a company s estimated future cash flows  and then discounting those future flows by the desired rate of return in order to determine the present value of the future cash stream 
to arrive at the cash flow projections used in our discounted cash flow models  we use internal models to estimate the expected results for the next five years 
the key assumptions used in our discounted cash flow models to determine fair value are discount rates  annual revenue growth rates  average operating margin  and terminal value capitalization rate 
the discount rates used in the discounted cash flow models ranged from to 
the terminal value was calculated by using a terminal value capitalization rate of changes in assumptions or estimates used in our goodwill impairment testing could materially affect the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit  and therefore could eliminate the excess of fair value over carrying value of a reporting unit and  in some cases  could result in impairment 
such changes in assumptions could be caused by a loss of one or more significant contracts  reductions in government and or private industry spending or a decline in the demand for our services due to changing economic conditions 
given the nature of our business  and in particular the reduced backlog of unfilled orders in our e c segment  if we are unable to win or renew contracts  unable to estimate and control our contract costs  fail to adequately perform to our clients expectations  fail to procure third party subcontractors  heavy equipment and materials or fail to adequately secure funding for our projects  our profits  revenues and growth over the long term would decline and such a decline could significantly affect the fair value assessment of our reporting units and cause our goodwill to become impaired 
at the march  testing date  our annual review did not indicate an impairment of goodwill for any of our reporting units 
the excess of the fair value of our reporting units over their respective carrying values for five of our reporting units exceeded 
our e c reporting unit  whose fair value did not exceed its carrying value by more than  has approximately million of goodwill allocated to it 
the resulting fair values provided valuations that  in aggregate  reasonably reconciled to our market capitalization  taking into account observable control premiums 
no events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would indicate an impairment of goodwill since the annual testing date 
see note goodwill and other intangibles to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f for additional information related to our goodwill impairment reviews 
we also perform an analysis on our intangible assets to test for impairment whenever events occur that indicate an impairment could exist 
pension plans our pension benefit obligations and expenses are calculated using actuarial models and methods  in accordance with asc  compensation retirement benefits 
two of the more critical assumptions and estimates used in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
other critical assumptions and estimates used in determining benefit obligations and plan expenses  including demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality  and turnover  are also evaluated periodically and updated accordingly to reflect our actual experience 
discount rates are determined annually and are based on rates of return of high quality corporate bonds 
expected long term rates of return on plan assets are determined annually and are based on an evaluation of our plan assets  historical trends and experience  taking into account current and expected market conditions 
plan assets are comprised primarily of equity and debt securities 
the discount rate utilized to determine the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date for our pension plans increased to at august   compared to at august   reflecting higher interest rates experienced during the fiscal year 
a basis point increase in the discount rates would reduce the benefit obligations on our foreign pension plans by approximately million 
the rate of return expected on our plan assets was at august  compared to at august  to determine the rates of return  we consider the historical experience and expected future performance of the plan assets  as well as the current and expected allocation of the plan assets 
the actuarial assumptions used in determining our pension benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates and longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
multiemployer plans we participate in various multiemployer pension plans under union and industry wide agreements 
generally  these plans provide defined benefits to substantially all employees covered by collective bargaining agreements 
under the employee retirement income security act erisa  a contributor to a multiemployer plan may be liable  upon termination or withdrawal from a plan  for its proportionate share of a plan s unfunded vested liability 
we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded 
moreover  if we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds  we might trigger a substantial withdrawal liability 
based on the most recent information available to us  we believe that the present value of actuarial accrued liabilities in one of these multiemployer plans exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits 
as a result  our contributions in the future might increase 
any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated
