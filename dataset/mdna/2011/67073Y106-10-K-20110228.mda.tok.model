overview npc and sppc are public utilities that generate  transmit and distribute electric energy in nevada and  in the case of sppc  also delivers natural gas service 
at year end  npc served approximately  electric customers primarily in las vegas  north las vegas  henderson and adjoining areas  including nellis air force base and the doe s nevada test site in nye county 
at year end  sppc served approximately  electric customers and its electric service territory covered over  square miles of western  central and northeastern nevada  including the cities of reno  sparks  carson city  and elko  and a portion of eastern california  including the lake tahoe area 
however  on january   sppc sold its california assets  as discussed in note  assets held for sale  of the notes to financial statements 
additionally  sppc provided natural gas service to approximately  customers in an area of about square miles in nevada s reno sparks area 
major industries served by the utilities include gaming recreation  mining  warehousing manufacturing and other governmental entities 
the utilities revenues and operating income are subject to fluctuations during the year due to the impacts that seasonal weather  rate changes and customer usage patterns have on demand for electric energy and services 
npc is a summer peaking utility  experiencing its highest retail energy sales in response to the demand for air conditioning 
sppc s electric system peak also occurs in the summer  with a slightly lower peak demand in the winter 
sppc s gas business typically peaks in the winter months due to heating demands 
npc and sppc service territories are as follows nve territory map beginning in  the utilities embarked on a three part energy supply strategy to manage resources against their load by encouraging energy efficiency and conservation programs  the purchase and development of renewable energy projects  construction of generating facilities and expanding transmission capability in an effort to reduce their reliance on purchased power 
energy efficiency and conservation programs a part of our strategy to reduce dependence on purchased power is to manage our resources against our load requirements with energy efficiency and conservation programs for our customers  also known as dsm programs 
nve has designed a portfolio of cost effective dsm programs that allow every customer to take advantage of savings from energy efficiency measures 
dsm programs are marketed across all segments of customer classes residential  commercial  industrial  public and low income 
in  the utilities invested million towards energy efficiency and conservation programs 
the utilities current budget includes approximately million for these programs 
in  the pucn approved dsm programs to increase energy efficiency and conservation programs totaling approximately million and million for npc and sppc  respectively  over the three year action plan 
the portfolio standard  discussed below  allows energy efficiency measures from qualified conservation programs to satisfy up to of the portfolio standard 
under this provision  a pec is created for each kwh of energy conserved by qualified energy efficiency programs 
in addition  energy saved during peak demand hours earns double the pecs for each kwh of energy conserved 
after the dsm percentage allowance is fully utilized  nve s strategy is to assess economic conditions and potential rate impacts in pursuing the implementation of cost effective dsm programs needed to achieve future portfolio standard requirements 
in addition  nve was awarded a million grant in stimulus funding  made available through the american recovery and reinvestment act  from the doe specifically for nve s million nv energize project 
in august of  the pucn approved the project 
in september  the grant was increased to million and nve committed to a million total project budget in order to include the development of a consumer confidence plan 
the plan will address consumer education and communication issues associated with the deployment of the smart grid infrastructure necessary to enable the achievement of metering and customer service operating savings  the expansion of demand response and energy efficiency benefits  and provide customers better information to help manage their energy usage 
purchase and development of renewable energy resources the portfolio standard requires a specific percentage of an electric service provider s total retail energy sales be obtained from renewable energy resources 
renewable resources include biomass  geothermal  solar  waterpower  wind and qualified recovered energy generation projects 
in addition  the portfolio standard allows energy efficiency measures from qualified conservation programs to meet up to of the portfolio percentage 
in and  the utilities are required to obtain an amount of pecs equivalent to of their total retail energy from renewables 
currently  the portfolio standard increases to for and  to in  after which it increases to for the years through  and to for and beyond 
moreover  n ot less than of the total portfolio standard must be satisfied from solar resources until when a minimum of must be solar 
the utilities compliance with the portfolio standard is dependent on the supply of pecs resulting from renewable energy generation and dsm activities 
the utilities acquire pecs through purchase power contracts  investments in renewable generating facilities and dsm programs 
in addition in  legislation was passed in nevada that permits renewable energy purchased outside nevada to qualify towards the portfolio standard  which among other benefits  give the utilities the ability to purchase pecs on a short term basis especially in an effort to fulfill shortfalls which may occur due to the success or timing in development of renewable energy projects  weather or other supplier issues 
currently  npc and sppc have contracts for mw and mw nominally rated  respectively of renewable energy resources from a variety of geothermal  solar  hydro  biomass  wind projects and npc s mw nominally rated recovered energy project 
approximately mws nominally rated of npc s resources are in various stages of development or may be contingent upon completion of on line  as discussed below 
in the pucn approved a stipulation under which npc was able to fully offset its pec shortfall for compliance year with pecs acquired in  permitted by nevada state law as discussed above  and surplus pecs loaned by sppc 
in  the utilities acquired sufficient pecs to fully meet the portfolio standard for  as well as to offset the shortfall from construction of generating and transmission facilities and optimizing the operation of current generation assets in  npc expects to complete construction of the mw nominally rated natural gas generating station at the existing harry allen generating station  which is expected to be operational by mid in  npc completed construction of the mw nominally rated goodsprings recovered energy generating station 
in february  nve and the utilities consummated their agreement with gbt to jointly construct and own on line  a kv transmission line  as discussed further under transmission and the utilities irp sections 
the completion of on line  expected in late  will connect nve s southern and northern territories  provide the ability to jointly dispatch energy throughout the state  provide access to isolated renewable energy resources in parts of northern and eastern nevada and enhance nve s ability to meet its portfolio standard  discussed above  and lower costs to our customers 
business and competitive environment operations npc and sppc electric the utilities are charged with meeting the energy needs of the residential and business populations in nevada  as well as the public sectors in nevada 
revenues are impacted by rate changes  cost of fuel and purchased power  seasonal or atypical weather and customer use 
the utilities electric peak demand occurs in the summer 
therefore  the utilities revenues and associated expenses are not incurred or generated evenly throughout the year 
to serve their customer base  the utilities generate electricity and purchase power in accordance with an esp  as discussed in more detail later in this section  under energy supply 
sppc gas sppc s natural gas company or ldc is responsible for providing natural gas to residential  commercial and industrial customers 
there are approximately  customers in the ldc which primarily covers the greater reno sparks area in washoe county 
sppc is currently implementing a program known as the blackwrap replacement program to replace some of the oldest distribution pipe in its system installed between and since  sppc has spent million replacing over miles of blackwrap and associated customer services 
sppc is well connected with several major gas producing regions and gas transportation systems into northern nevada 
sppc s gas distribution system receives gas supplies from two interstate natural gas pipelines  the paiute pipeline company and the tuscarora gas transmission company 
in addition  sppc has contracted for natural gas storage services to supplement firm and spot market purchases 
regulatory environment the ferc and pucn regulate portions of the utilities accounting practices and electricity and natural gas rates 
the ferc has jurisdiction under the federal power act with respect to wholesale rates  service  interconnection  accounting  and other matters in connection with the utilities sale of electricity for resale and interstate transmission 
the ferc also has jurisdiction over the natural gas pipeline companies from which the utilities buy transportation for natural gas 
the pucn has authority over rates charged to retail customers  the issuance of securities by the utilities and transactions with affiliated parties 
nevada state regulations require the utilities to file electric grcs every three years with the pucn to adjust rates  based primarily on cost of service and return on investment 
nevada state regulations also require the utilities to file annual deaa applications to either recover or refund electric balances that have been deferred and that represent the difference between fuel and purchased power costs actually incurred and the amounts collected in current retail rates 
additionally  the utilities are required to file to reset bters quarterly  reflecting more recent fuel and purchased power costs 
moreover  in  the pucn adopted regulations authorizing an electric utility to recover an amount from its customers that is attributable t o the measurable and verifiable effects associated with the utilities implementation of efficiency and conservation programs approved by the pucn 
the utilities filed their first rate case with respect to this new regulation  referred to by the utilities as the eeir rate and eepr rate  in october and will continue to file rate cases annually in march  thereafter 
see note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements  for further discussion on the various rate cases 
nevada state regulations further require annual filings to reset base purchased gas rates and recover deferred balances that include purchased gas costs above or below the amounts collected in current rates 
the regulations also require a gas supply report as well as a gas informational report to be filed annually 
natural gas commodity costs are passed directly through to customers on a dollar for dollar basis 
sppc may also file gas grcs to adjust gas division rates including cost of service and return on investment 
rate cases are discussed in more detail in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  regulatory proceedings  and note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements 
competition npc and sppc electric the utilities operate under franchise agreements in their respective operating areas  therefore  competition in their operating areas is limited 
under nevada state law  commercial customers with an average annual load of mw or more may file a letter of intent and application with the pucn to acquire electric energy  capacity  and ancillary services from another provider 
the law requires customers wishing to choose a new supplier to receive the approval of the pucn and meet public interest standards 
in particular  departing customers must secure new energy resources that are not under contract to npc or sppc  the departure must not burden the utilities with increased costs or cause any remaining customers to pay increased costs  and the departing customers must pay their portion of any deferred energy balances 
the pucn adopted regulations prescribing the criteria that will be used to determine if there will be negative impacts to remaining customers or to the utilities 
customers wishing to choose a new supplier must provide day notice to npc or sppc 
the utilities would continue to provide transmission  distribution  metering  and billing services to such customers 
currently  there are no material applications pending with the pucn to exit the system in npc s or sppc s service territory 
in the event a customer were to exit the system  the departure would not have a material impact on the utilities net income 
sppc gas sppc s natural gas ldc business is subject to competition from other suppliers and other forms of energy available to its customers 
large gas customers using  therms per month with fuel switching capability are allowed to participate in the incentive natural gas rate tariff 
once a service agreement has been executed  a customer can compare natural gas prices under this tariff to alternative energy sources and choose their source of fuel 
additionally  customers using greater than  therms per day have the ability to secure their own gas supplies under a transportation tariff 
as of january   there were large customers securing their own gas supplies 
these customers have a combined firm distribution load of approximately  dth per day 
tr ansportation customers continue to pay firm and interruptible distribution charges 
these customers are responsible for procuring and paying for their own gas supply  which reduces sppc s purchases  but does not have an impact on net income 
sales in  npc s and sppc s electric revenues were approximately billion and million  respectively 
sppc s natural gas business accounted for approximately million in operating revenues or of sppc s total revenues 
npc s peak electric load increased at an average annual growth rate of over the past five years  while sppc s decreased by 
in  npc s and sppc s electric system peaks were  mw and  mw  respectively  compared to  mw and  mw  respectively  in npc s total retail electric mwh sales have increased at an average annual growth rate of over the past five years  however  total retail electric mwh sales declined slightly in compared to as discussed below 
 sppc s total retail electric mwh sales have decreased at an average annual rate of over the past five years primarily due to a decrease in mining customers discussed below 
npc s electric customers by class contributed the following mwh sales mwh sales billed and unbilled mwh of total mwh of total mwh of total retail residential commercial industrial gaming recreation restaurants all other retail total retail wholesale sales to public authorities total total retail mwh sales decreased approximately in from  primarily due to a decrease in customer usage due to conservation programs  economic conditions and hotter than normal weather in may npc s average retail residential customer count increased by in from npc s service territory  which consists primarily of las vegas  key economic indicators  as outlined below  continued to decline or have shown moderate improvement from unemployment in las vegas was in december  up from a year ago  in southern nevada  construction activity  another leading indicator  has seen a decrease in the number of commercial permits while residential permits has remained relatively flat  construction employment decreased as of november compared to november  as of november  taxable sales increased from a year ago  as of december  gaming revenues declined from a year ago  as of december  visitor volume increased from a year ago  as of december  the hotel motel occupancy rate in las vegas increased approximately from a year ago  and the estimated room growth rate in was primarily due to the cosmopolitan resort and casino which added approximately  rooms 
in  room growth is expected to increase to and then slow to in sppc s electric customers by class contributed the following mwh sales mwh sales billed and unbilled mwh of total mwh of total mwh of total retail residential commercial and industrial mining all other retail total retail wholesale sales to public authorities total total retail mwh sales decreased approximately in from  primarily due to a decrease in customer usage as a result of milder summer weather  conservation programs and economic conditions 
also contributing to the decrease in mwhs in  compared to and  is the transition of certain customers to dos as discussed below 
these decreases were partially offset by increased industrial usage primarily from a gold mining customer who resumed full operation in october mining is a leading industry in northern nevada and comprises one of sppc s largest classes of customers 
according to the nevada mining association  spot gold price levels  coupled with nevada s reasonable regulatory environment  the state s favorable geology for gold deposits  and the industry s success in controlling its costs and attracting a high quality labor force offer a strong foundation for investment in continued mine development and the industry s continuing high level of energy usage 
as discussed above  in and  sppc saw a decline in usage of mining customers as they switched to dos service  however in  mining customer usage increased as a result of a mining customer who restored operations in october in sppc s service territory  which consists primarily of washoe county  key economic indicators  as outlined below  continue to decline or have shown moderate improvement from unemployment in washoe county was at as of december  up from a year ago  construction employment decreased as of november from november  as of november  taxable sales increased by compared to a year ago  and as of december  gaming revenues decreased compared to a year ago 
sppc has long term electric service agreements with eight of its largest commercial and industrial customers  with yearly revenues under these agreements totaling approximately million 
for  this represented approximately of sppc s electric operating revenues of approximately million 
such agreements include requirements for customers to maintain minimum demand and load factor levels 
in addition  they include provisions to recover all investments for customer specific facilities that have been made by sppc on their behalf 
commercial customers who receive approval from the pucn to acquire electric energy  capacity  and ancillary services from another provider  and who may have previously received service from sppc under terms of a long term service agreement  will migrate to being served under the provisions of a dos agreement 
under a dos agreement  customer specific facilities charges will continue to be collected along with a flat distribution charge per meter 
heating degree days hdd and cooling degree days cdd mwh usage may be affected by the change in heating degree or cooling degree days in a given year 
a degree day indicates how far that day average temperature departed from f 
heating degree days measure heating energy demand and indicates how far the average temperature fell below f 
cooling degree days measures cooling energy demand and indicates how far the temperature averaged above f 
for example  if a location had a mean temperature of f on day and f on day  there would be hdd minus and cdd for day in contrast  there would be hdd and cdd minus for day the following table shows the heating degree days and cooling degree days within npc and sppc service territories for each of the last three years 
amount change from prior year amount change from prior year amount npc hdd cdd sppc hdd cdd data source national weather service demand load and resources forecast npc s peak electric demand increased in to  mws from  mws in sppc s peak electric demand increased in to  mws from  mws in variations in energy usage occur as a result of varying weather conditions  economic conditions  and other energy usage behaviors  such as conservation efforts by our customers 
these variations necessitate a continual balancing of loads and resources  and requires both purchases and sales of energy under short and long term contracts and the prudent management and optimization of available resources 
the utilities plan to meet their customers needs through a combination of company owned generation and purchased power 
see the generation section and purchased power section below for details of the utilities generation and contracts for purchased power 
remaining needs will be met through power purchases through rfps or short term purchases 
as shown in the tables below  the utilities have sufficient resources to meet anticipated customer requirements 
however  resource adequacy may be affected by a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the unplanned retirement of aging or less efficient generating stations  the timing or achievement of commercial operation with respect to renewable energy power projects not yet commercially operable  as well as the int ermittent reliability of renewable energy resources  customer behavior with respect to dsm programs and environmental regulations which may limit our ability to operate certain generating units 
resource adequacy provides the utilities the ability to maintain a reliable supply of energy  however as discussed under resource optimization  to the extent the resources are not needed  the utilities will attempt to sell their additional availability in an effort to reduce costs 
below are tables summarizing the forecasted summer electric capacity requirement and resource needs of the utilities after consideration of energy conservation programs assuming no curtailment of supply or load  and normal weather conditions and the completion of on line  expected in late  as discussed in the transmission section later forecasted electric capacity requirements and resources mw npc total requirements resources company owned existing generation company owned new generation contracts for power purchases contracts for renewable energy power purchases  not yet commercially operable total resources total additional required additional resources includes projected system peak load plus planning reserves

includes mws combined cycle unit at the harry allen generating station expected to be completed mid includes long term purchase power agreements for renewable energy that are not yet commercially operable and or may not materialize due to project delays  under performance or cancelations 
total additional required is the difference between the total requirements and total resources 
total additional required represents the amount needed to achieve the forecasted system peak plus a planning reserve margin conversely  additional resources represents resources in excess of forecasted system peak plus a planning reserve margin 
forecasted electric capacity requirements and resources mw sppc total requirements resources company owned existing generation contracts for power purchases total resources total additional required additional resources includes projected system peak load plus planning reserves 
total additional required represents the difference between the total requirements and total resources 
total additional required represents the amount needed to achieve the forecasted system peak plus a planning reserve margin conversely  additional resources represents resources in excess of forecasted system peak plus a planning reserve margin 
resource optimization resource optimization entails the responsible purchase and sale of electric power  fuel and financial energy products by the utilities 
the utilities optimize their portfolios continuously in order to meet load obligations in a cost effective and reliable manner within transmission constraints 
the utilities continuously monitor the resources available to meet load obligations  recognizing the uncertainty not only in system conditions  such as planned and unplanned outages of generating or transmission facilities  but also in regional energy markets organized across different commodities  locations  demand and trading timeframes 
as conditions change and new information becomes available  the utilities optimize their portfolios as appropriate to account f or changes in load  cost  volatility  reliability and other commercial or technical factors 
in addition  the utilities short term resource optimization strategy involves both day ahead next day through the end of the current month and real time next hour through the end of the current day activities that require buying  selling and scheduling power resources to determine the most economical way to produce or procure the power resources needed to meet the retail customer load and operating reserve requirement 
real time resource optimization requires an hourly determination of whether to increase or decrease the loading of currently operating generating units  to commit previously off line generating units  to un commit currently operating generating units  to sell excess power  or to purchase power in the real time market to meet the utilities resource needs 
in order to achieve the lowest o verall cost  the projected incremental or decremental cost of the next available generation resource options is compared to the market to determine the lowest cost option 
energy supply total system the utilities manage a portfolio of energy supply options 
the availability of alternate resources allows the utilities to dispatch their electric generation system in a more cost effective manner under varying operating and fuel market conditions while maintaining system integrity

as a supplement to their own generation  the utilities purchase spot  firm and non firm energy to meet its customer demand requirements 
total energy supply includes purchases from outside the electric system due to limited control area generation and also the need to access market energy supplies 
the utilities decision to purchase this energy is based on economics  mitigation of availability risk  regulatory requirements and system import limits 
firm block purchases are transacted as both a price hedging strategy and to ensure that needed firm capacity is available over peak load periods 
spot market energy is purchased based on the economics of purchasing as available energy when it is less expensive than the utilities own generation  again  subject to net system import lim its

generation npc continues construction of a mw nominally rated natural gas generating station at the existing harry allen generating station  which is expected to be operational by mid in  npc completed construction of goodsprings  a mw nominally rated recovered energy generating station  which qualifies as a source of pecs under the portfolio standard 
npc s generation capacity consists of a combination of gas  oil and coal generating units with a combined summer capacity of  mws as described in item  properties 
in  npc generated approximately of its total system requirements 
sppc s generation capacity consists of a combination of gas  oil and coal generating units with a combined summer capacity of  mws as described in item  properties 
in  sppc generated approximately of its total system requirements 
fuel sources the utilities fuel sources for electric generation were provided by natural gas  coal  and oil 
the average costs of gas  coal  and oil  including hedging costs  for energy generation per mmbtu for the years through  along with the percentage contribution to the utilities total fuel sources were as follows npc electric average consumption cost percentage contribution to total fuel gas coal oil mmbtu percent mmbtu percent mmbtu percent for a discussion of the change in fuel costs  see results of operations in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
was a transition period in which npc moved from a one season ahead competitive bidding process to a laddering strategy in which physical gas supplies are procured up to three seasons ahead for the time period through the winter season and a four season ahead laddering for the time period starting with summer season through two seasonal competitive bidding processes 
although npc has actively requested fixed price physical gas supplies  no such fixed price transactions were executed during therefore  the physical gas prices are set at an appropriate industry index during the month of current delivery 
all natural gas is delivered to npc through the use of firm gas transport contracts 
monthly and daily gas supply adjustments are made based on the current energy marketplace and operational considerations 
npc utilizes a laddered strategy with respect to coal supply and has three long term coal contracts with arch coal company one expires in and two expire in and one with andalex resources  inc expires to supply the reid gardner generating station 
these contracts represent of projected coal requirements for  for and for current sources of coal supply  such as powder river basin coal  allow for updated laddering strategies to be applied 
as of december   npc s reid gardner generating station coal inventory level was  tons  or approximately days of consumption at capacity 
a transportation services contract with union pacific railroad company provides for deliveries from the provo  utah interchange  as well as various mines in utah  colorado and wyoming  to the reid gardner generating station in moapa  nevada 
the union pacific contract has been extended to coal for the navajo generating station  which is jointly owned by several entities and operated by salt river  is obtained from surface mining operations conducted by peabody on portions of the black mesa in arizona within the navajo and hopi indian tribes the tribes reservations

similar to npc discussed above  sppc utilizes a laddering strategy to procure gas 
although sppc has actively requested fixed price physical gas supplies  no such fixed price transactions were executed during therefore  the physical gas prices are set at an appropriate industry index during the month of current delivery 
all natural gas is delivered to sppc through the use of firm gas transport contracts 
monthly and daily gas supply adjustments are made based on the current energy marketplace and operational considerations 
sppc utilizes a laddered strategy with respect to coal supply and has long term coal contracts with black butte coal company and arch coal sales company that provide for deliveries through december  and december  respectively 
these contracts represent of the valmy generating station s projected coal requirements in  for  for  for  and for union pacific railroad originates and delivers coal to the valmy generating station 
a new contract has been entered into through december  to replace the previous contract that expired on march  as of december   the coal inventory level at valmy generating station was  tons or approximately days of consumption at capacity 
sppc gas growth in all sectors is expected to continue  at a slow pace 
sppc plans its gas infrastructure and supply to serve a demand that would occur if the average of the high and low temperatures for a given day drops to negative five degrees fahrenheit  which is estimated to be  dth per day for the winter of to secure gas supplies for power generation and the ldc  sppc contracted for firm winter  summer  and annual gas supplies with over a dozen canadian and domestic suppliers 
in  seasonal and monthly gas supply net purchases averaged approximately  dth per day with the winter period contracts averaging approximately  dth per day  and the summer period contracts averaging approximately  dth per day 
sppc s firm natural gas supply is supplemented with natural gas storage services and supplies from the northwest pipeline company facility located at jackson prairie in southern washington 
the jackson prairie facility can contribute up to a total of  dth per day of peaking supplies 
in an effort to optimize the value of sppc s assets  beginning in november of  sppc entered into a one year agreement whereby the counterparty acquired the rights to the jackson prairie storage facility and some of sppc s gas transport assets during the term of the agreement 
sppc also has storage on the paiute pipeline system 
this liquefied gas storage facility provides for an incremental supply of  dth per day and is available at any time with two hours notice 
therefore  this storage project supports increases in short term gas supply needs due to unforeseen events such as extreme weather patterns and pipeline interruptions

water supply npc and sppc assured supplies of water are important for the utilities generating plants  and at the present time  the utilities have adequate water to meet their generation needs 
reliable water supply is critical to the entire desert southwest region  including the state of nevada 
the newer generation facilities in the utilities fleet have been designed to minimize water usage and employ innovative conservation based technologies such as dry cooling and recycled water 
although there are current drought conditions in the las vegas area  water resources for most of these facilities rely on regional aquifers and recycled water that are not closely connected to transient drought conditions 
our water supply rights could be impacted by recent litigation and administrative proceedings before the nevada state engineer on remand 
on june   the nevada supreme court  in the matter of great basin water network v 
taylor  held that the nevada state engineer had failed to act on certain water appropriation applications within the time period set forth by statute and was therefore required to re notice the water appropriation applications and re open the protest period 
this action resulted in certain permits for use of water being invalidated 
although none of the affected permits are being relied upon by the utilities  the court s decision did call into question the validity of other permits  including the permits of third parties with whom we have water supply arrangements 
administrative and judicial proceedings continue in this matter and nve has actively participated in these various proceedings and continues to closely monitor the case 
at this time  neither nve nor the utilities can predict the outcome of these administrative or judicial proceedings 
purchased power under the guidelines set forth in the respective esps  npc and sppc continue to manage a diverse portfolio of contracted and spot market supplies  as well as its own generation resources  with the objective of minimizing its net average system operating costs 
during  npc and sppc purchased approximately and  respectively  of their total electric energy requirements 
npc electric npc purchases both forward firm energy and spot market energy based on economics  regulatory requirements  operating reserve margins  and unit availability 
npc seeks to manage its loads efficiently by utilizing its generation resources and long term purchase power contracts in conjunction with buying and selling opportunities in the market 
npc has entered into long term purchase power contracts or more years with suppliers that generate electricity utilizing gas and renewable resource facilities with a total mw nameplate capacity of  and contract termination dates ranging from to included in these contracts are mw of nameplate capacity of renewable energy of which approximately mw of nameplate capacity are under development or construction and not currently available 
the pecs from renewable resource facilities are used towards compliance with the portfolio standard 
energy from some of these contracts is delivered and sold to sppc through intercompany related purchase power contracts due to the resource location and transmission constraints  however  npc retains the pec associated with such contracts 
 the completion of on line  expected in  will give npc the ability to take delivery of the energy from these contracts 
npc is a member of the wspp and the srsg 
npc s membership in the srsg has allowed it to network with other utilities in an effort to use its resources more efficiently in the sharing of responsibilities for reserves 
npc s credit standing may affect the terms under which npc is able to purchase fuel and electricity in the western energy markets  however  as a result of npc s improved credit rating over the last several years  this was not a significant factor in sppc electric sppc purchases both forward firm energy and spot market energy based on economics  regulatory requirements  operating reserve margins  and unit availability 
sppc seeks to manage its loads efficiently by utilizing its generation resources and long term purchase power contracts in conjunction with buying and selling opportunities in the market 
sppc has entered into long term purchase power contracts or more years with suppliers that generate electricity utilizing coal and renewable resource facilities  with a total mw nameplate capacity of and contract termination dates ranging from to included in these contracts are mw of nameplate capacity of renewable energy 
the pecs from renewable resource facilities are used towards compliance with the portfolio standard 
energy from one of these contracts is delivered and sold to npc through an intercompany related purchase power contract due to the resource location and transmission constraints  however  sppc retains the pec associated with this contract 
the completion of on line  expected in late  will give sppc the ability to take delivery of the energy from these contr acts 
sppc is a member of the nwpp and wspp 
these pools have provided sppc further access to reserves and spot market power  respectively  in the pacific northwest and southwest 
in turn  sppc s generation resources provide a backup source for other pool members who rely heavily on hydroelectric systems 
sppc s credit standing may affect the terms under which sppc is able to purchase fuel and electricity in the western energy markets  however  as a result of sppc s improved credit rating over the last several years  this was not a significant factor in transmission electric transmission systems deliver energy from electric generators to distribution systems for final delivery to customers 
transmission systems are designed to move electricity over long distances because generators can be located anywhere from a few miles to hundreds of miles from customers 
the utilities electric transmission systems are part of the western interconnection  the regional grid in the west 
the western interconnection includes the interconnected transmission systems of fourteen western states  two canadian provinces and the parts of mexico that make up the western electricity coordinating council wecc 
wecc is one of eight regional councils of the nerc  the entity responsible for the reliability  adequacy and security of north america s bulk electric system 
npc s transmission system links generating units within and outside of the npc balancing authority area to the npc distribution system 
npc s transmission system is directly interconnected with the transmission systems of western area power administration  los angeles department of water and power  southern california edison  and pacificorp 
sppc s transmission system links generating units within the sppc balancing authority area to the sppc distribution system 
sppc s transmission system is directly interconnected with the transmission systems of idaho power  los angeles department of water and power  southern california edison  pacificorp  bonneville power administration  pacific gas electric and plumas sierra rural electric cooperative 
the service territories of npc and sppc are not currently interconnected  however  in february  nve and the utilities entered into an agreement with gbt to construct on line  which is expected to be completed in late on line is a joint project between the utilities and gbt  an affiliate of ls power 
the joint project consists of two phases 
in phase of the joint project  the parties would complete construction of an initial kv interconnection between the robinson summit substation on the sppc system and the harry allen generating station on the npc system by december  phase is essentially identical to on line or the utilities self build option  as discussed under npc s irp 
under the joint project  the utilities would own a interest in phase and enter into a transmission use agreement with gbt for its interest in phase the utilities would have rights to of the capacity of phase  which is estimated at approximately mw 
npc would operate and maintain a ll phase facilities 
in phase  gbt would construct two additional transmission segments at either end of on line one extending from robinson summit north to midpoint  idaho  and the other commencing at the harry allen generating station and interconnecting south to the eldorado substation 
gbt would pay for and own of phase facilities 
however  npc and sppc would have rights to additional transmission capacity from midpoint to eldorado for a total of approximately mw based on a rating of  mw for the complete path 
on line territory map under the nerc guidelines  the utilities are balancing authorities  transmission operators  and transmission owners among other roles 
as defined by nerc  the balancing authority integrates resource plans ahead of time  maintains load interchange generation balance within a balancing authority area  and supports interconnection frequency in real time ie  the balancing authority is responsible for assuring that the demands on the system are matched by an equivalent amount of resources  whether from generators within its area or from imports 
the transmission operator is responsible for the reliability of its local transmission system  and operates or directs the operations of the transmission facilities 
the transmission owner owns and maintains transmission facilities 
the utilities also schedule power deliveries over their transmission systems and maintain reliability through their operations and maintenance practices and by verifying that customers are matching loads with resources 
npc and sppc plan  build  and operate transmission systems that delivered  mwh and  mwh of electricity to customers  respectively  in their balancing authority areas in the npc system handled a system peak load of  mw in through approximately  miles of transmission lines and other transmission facilities ranging from kv to kv 
the sppc system handled a system peak load of  mw in through  miles of transmission lines and other facilities ranging from kv to kv 
the utilities process generation and transmission interconnection requests and requests for transmission service from a variety of customers 
these requests usually involve new planning studies and the negotia tion of contracts with new and existing customers in this growing system 
transmission regulatory environment transmission for the utilities bundled retail customers is subject to the jurisdiction of the pucn for rate making purposes 
the utilities provide cost based wholesale and retail access transmission services under the terms of a ferc approved oatt 
in accordance with the oatt  the utilities offer several transmission services to wholesale customers long term and short term firm point to point transmission service highest quality service with fixed delivery and receipt points  non firm point to point service as available service with fixed delivery and receipt points  and network transmission service equivalent to the service npc provides for npc s bundled retail customers 
these services are all offered on a nondiscriminatory basis in that all potential customers  including the utilities  have an equal opportunity to access the transmission system 
the utilities transmission business is managed and operated independently from the energy marketing business in accordance with ferc s standards of conduct 
the utilities are members of westconnect and the westconnect subregional transmission planning committee 
westconnect is a group of southwest transmission providing utilities that have agreed to work collaboratively to assess stakeholder and market needs and to investigate  analyze and recommend to its steering committee implementation of cost effective enhancements to the western wholesale electricity market 
the subregional transmission planning committee was established to provide coordinated transmission planning across the westconnect footprint  including the southwest area transmission group  in which npc participates  and the sierra subregional planning group  in which sppc participates 
integrated resource plan the utilities are required to file irps every three years  and as necessary  may file amendments to their irps 
the irps are prepared in compliance with nevada laws and regulations and cover a year period 
the irps develop a comprehensive  integrated plan that considers customer energy requirements and propose the resources to meet those requirements in a manner that is consistent with prevailing market fundamentals 
the ultimate goal of the irps is to balance the objectives of minimizing costs and reducing volatility while reliably meeting the electric needs of npc s and sppc s customers 
the esp  discussed in detail later  operates in conjunction with the irp 
it serves as a guide for near term execution and fulfillment of energy needs 
npc electric in july  the pucn issued its order on npc s irp  which included the following significant items approval to jointly develop on line with gbt  an affiliate of ls power  discussed earlier in the transmission section 
the pucn also approved npc s self build option for on line if the companies and gbt were unable to reach agreement 
however  in february  the utilities and gbt finalized the agreement to jointly construct on line 
granted npc s request for critical facility designation for its incremental operating and maintenance costs for on line 
approval of nv energize  as discussed earlier under energy efficiency and conservation programs  of approximately million and million excluding afudc for npc and sppc  respectively  which was contingent on successfully obtaining a grant of million in federal funds from the doe to co fund the project 
a total grant of million was obtained from the doe in september approval to establish a regulatory asset for stranded non advanced metering infrastructure electric meter costs related to nv energize 
approval of various dsm programs to increase energy efficiency and conservation programs totaling approximately million over the three year action plan 
accepted npc s proposal to postpone the eec indefinitely  but ordered npc to resubmit the request as a part of its next triennial irp filing in july in february  nve and the utilities canceled plans to construct the eec 
approval of the long term load forecast and the three year forecast 
sppc electric in july  as required by nevada law  sppc filed its triennial irp with the pucn 
in december  the pucn issued its order on sppc irp  which included the following significant items approval of the long term load forecast and the three year forecast 
a finding that the sale of the california assets to calpeco is in the public interest of nevada  authorizing and accepting the accounting adjustments and ratemaking treatment proposed by sppc and authorizing entry into and performing transactions necessary to accomplish the sale of the california assets to calpeco 
the sale of the california assets was completed in january see note  assets held for sale  in the notes to financial statements 
authority to modify retirement dates for eleven remote generation facilities and retire and decommission ten remote generation facilities and to accumulate the costs of decommissioning and remediating the remote generation sites in separate regulatory assets subaccounts for recovery in a future grc proceeding 
affirmed the funding level for a transmission project approved in sppc s irp filing of approximately million 
approval of dsm programs scopes  budgets  timetables and measures and the demand side plan totaling approximately million 
energy supply planning general the energy supply function at the utilities encompasses the reliable and efficient operation of the utilities owned generation  the procurement of all fuels and purchased power and resource optimization ie  physical and economic dispatch 
the utilities face energy supply challenges for their respective load control areas 
there is the potential for continued price volatility in each utility s service territory  particularly during peak periods 
too great a dependence on generation from the wholesale market can lead to power price volatilities depending on available power supply and prevailing gas prices 
both utilities face load obligation uncertainty due to the potential for customer switching 
some counterparties in these areas have significant credit difficulties  representing credit risk to the utilities 
finally  each utility s own credit situation can have an impact on its ability to enter into transactions 
in response to these energy supply challenges  the utilities have adopted an approach to managing the energy supply function that has three primary elements 
the first element is a set of management guidelines to procuring and optimizing the supply portfolio that is consistent with the requirements of a load serving entity with a full requirements obligation 
the second element is an energy risk management and risk control approach that ensures clear separation of roles between the day to day management of risks and compliance monitoring and control  and ensures clear distinction between policy setting or planning and execution 
lastly  the utilities will pursue a process of ongoing regulatory involvement and acknowledgement of the resource portfolio management plans 
within the energy supply planning process  there are three key components covering different time frames the pucn approved long term irp  which is filed every three years  has a twenty year planning horizon  the pucn approved esp which is an intermediate term resource procurement and risk management plan that establishes the supply portfolio strategies within which intermediate term resource requirements will be met  has a one to three year planning horizon  and tactical execution activities with a one month to twelve month focus 
the esp operates in conjunction with the pucn approved twenty year irp 
it serves as a guide for near term execution and fulfillment of energy needs 
when the esp calls for executing contracts with a duration of more than three years  the irp regulations require pucn approval as part of the resource planning process 
in developing and executing esps  management guidelines followed by the utilities include maintaining an esp that minimizes supply costs and retail price volatility and maximizes reliability of supply over the term of the esp  investigating feasible commercial options to execute the esp  applying quantitative techniques and diligence commensurate with risk to evaluate and execute each transaction  monitoring the portfolio against evolving market conditions and managing the resource optimization options  and ensuring transparent and well documented decisions and execution processes 
in march  and again in december  the pucn accepted a stipulation among bcp  pucn staff  and the utilities in which no additional financial gas hedges will be procured 
the utilities shall continue to monitor its natural gas hedging strategy in light of prevailing market fundamentals and conditions 
energy risk management and control the utilities efforts to manage energy commodity electricity  natural gas  coal and oil price risk are governed by the bod revised and approved enterprise risk management and control policy 
that policy created the eroc and made that committee responsible for the overall policy direction of the utilities risk management and control efforts 
that policy further instructed the eroc to oversee the development of appropriate risk management and control policies including the energy risk management and control policy 
the utilities commodity risk management program establishes a control framework based on existing commercial practices 
the program creates predefined risk thresholds and delineates management responsibilities and organizational relationships 
the program requires that transaction accounting systems and procedures be maintained for systematically identifying  measuring  evaluating and responding to the variety of risks inherent in the utilities commercial activities 
the program s control framework consists of a disclosure and reporting mechanism designed to keep management fully informed of the operation s compliance with portfolio and credit limits 
the utilities  through the purchase and sale of financial instruments and physical products  maintain an energy risk management program that limits energy risk to levels consistent with esps approved by the ceo and the eroc 
intermediate term esps the utilities update their intermediate term esps annually 
in july  sppc filed its esp update for the period  and in september  npc filed its esp update for the period both plans were approved by the eroc and the ceo prior to submission to the pucn 
the esps operate within the framework of the pucn approved year irps and serve as a guide for near term execution and fulfillment of energy needs 
when the esps call for the execution of contracts of duration of more than three years  an amendment to the irp is prepared and submitted for pucn approval 
the summer needs of for both sppc and npc will be met through a portfolio mix consisting of self generation  forward contracts for power and peaking and seasonal capacity  or synthetic tolling based contracts ie  power prices indexed to gas prices  to meet the following requirements optimize the tradeoff between overall fuel and purchased power cost and market price and supply risk 
pursue in region capacity to enhance long term regional reliability 
represent the set of transactions products available in the market 
manage credit risk in a market with some counter parties that may be in a weak financial condition 
procure to meet a needle peak load profile 
manage energy price risk through ongoing intermediate and short term optimization activities eg  optimizing the dispatch of generation  buying heat rate call options for summer capacity  or buying energy from the market 
long term purchased power activities the utilities update their respective planning documents irps  esps  and the portfolio standard annual report on a regular and as needed basis to determine their energy and pec needs 
when the planning documents call for energy and or pecs  rfps are issued  bids are evaluated  and contracts are executed with the successful bidders 
contracts requiring pucn approval are submitted to the pucn as part of the irp or an amendment to an irp 
long term purchase power contracts are discussed in more detail earlier  under purchased power 
short term resource optimization strategy the utilities short term resource optimization strategy involves both day ahead next day through the end of the current month and real time next hour through the end of the current day activities that require buying  selling and scheduling power resources to determine the most economical way to produce or procure the power resources needed to meet the retail customer load and operating reserve requirement 
the utilities commit and dispatch generating units based on the comparative economics of generation versus spot market purchase opportunities 
any amount of excess capacity or energy is sold on the wholesale market  when possible  while any deficient capacity or energy position is filled by either buying on the spot market or util izing available generating capacity 
the day ahead resource optimization begins with an analysis of projected hourly loads  existing resources and operating reserve requirements 
firm forward take or pay contracts are scheduled and counted towards meeting the capacity needs of the day being pre scheduled 
the day of resource optimization involves minimizing system production costs each hour by lowering or raising generating unit output or buying power and or selling excess power in the wholesale market all in order to meet the system load requirement and operating reserve requirement 
any sale of excess power priced above the incremental cost of producing such power reduces the net production cost of operating the electrical system and thereby benefits the end use customer 
the utilities endeavor to reduce the electrical system s net production cost by selling available excess energy when it exists 
real time resource optimization requires an hourly determination of whether to increase or decrease the loading of on line generating units  commit previously off line generating units  un commit on line generating units  sell excess power  or purchase power in the real time market to meet the companies resource needs 
in order to achieve the lowest overall cost  the projected incremental or decremental cost of the next available generation resource options is compared to the current market to determine the lowest cost option 
construction program the utilities construction programs and estimated expenditures are subject to continuing review  and are periodically revised to include the rate of load growth  construction costs  availability of fuel types  the number and status of proposed independent generation projects  the need for additional transmission capacity in nevada  regulatory considerations and impact to customers  the utilities ability to raise necessary capital  and changes in environmental regulations 
under the utilities franchise agreements  they are obligated to provide a safe and reliable source of energy to their customers 
capital construction expenditures and estimates are reflective of the utilities obligation to serve their growing customer base 
construction expenditures for  including afudc  net salvage  customer advances and ciac  were million and million for npc and sppc  respectively  and for the period through  were billion and billion  respectively 
estimated construction expenditures for pucn approved projects  projects under contract  compliance projects and other base capital requirements are as follows dollars in millions total year npc electric facilities generation distribution transmission other total total estimated cash requirements related to npc construction projects consist of the following dollars in thousands total year construction expenditures afudc net salvage cost of removal net customer advances and ciac total cash requirements total year sppc electric facilities generation distribution transmission other total gas facilities distribution other total common facilities total total estimated cash requirements related to sppc construction projects consist of the following dollars in thousands total year construction expenditures afudc net salvage cost of removal net customer advances and ciac total cash requirements major pucn approved projects included in the year estimated construction expenditures are as follows dollars in thousands projects approved by pucn total cost total project cost cash flows cumulative expenditures as of december  projected in service completion date year harry allen generating station nv energize on line in  the pucn approved the construction of a new mw nominally rated natural gas combined cycle electric generating plant at npc s harry allen generating station 
this facility  miles northeast of las vegas  is expected to commence operations by mid in  the pucn approved the nv energize project 
the project is expected to include the deployment of a fully integrated advanced metering infrastructure  a meter data management system  and a demand response management system 
of the total million dollars in projected costs  million is expected to be provided by the doe through its smart grid investment grant program 
the million expected to be provided by the utilities will be allocated to npc and sppc and  respectively 
as discussed earlier in transmission  nve and the utilities entered in an agreement with gbt to construct on line 
as part of the agreement  nve and the utilities share in the approximate million project will be approximately million which will be allocated to npc and sppc and  respectively 
environmental nve  npc and sppc as with other utilities  npc and sppc are subject to various environmental laws and regulations enforced by federal  state and local authorities 
the epa  ndep and clark county department of air quality and environmental management administer regulations involving air quality  water pollution  solid  and hazardous and toxic waste 
nevada s utility environmental protection act also requires the utilities to obtain approval of the pucn prior to construction of major utility  generation or transmission facilities 
from the beginning phases of siting and development to the ongoing operation of existing or new electric generating  transmission and distribution facilities  our activities involve compliance with diverse laws and regulations which address noise  emissions  impacts to air and water  protected and cultural resources  solid  hazardous  and toxic waste 
our activities often require complex and lengthy processes as we obtain approvals  permits or licenses for new  existing or modified facilities 
additionally  the use and handling of various chemicals or hazardous materials including wastes requires release prevention plans and emergency response procedures 
as new laws or regulations are promulgated  we assess their applicability and implement the necessary modifications to our facilities or our operations to ensure complete complianc e 
the most significant environmental laws and regulations  both in effect and proposed  that could impact npc and sppc are discussed below federal environmental laws  regulations and regulatory initiatives clean air standards the clean air act caa provides a framework for protecting and improving the nation s air quality and controlling mobile and stationary sources of air emissions 
the amendments to the caa impose limitations on the emissions of sulfur dioxide so  nitrogen oxide nox as well as other pollutants 
all of the utilities fossil fuel generating stations are subject to these limitations and are in compliance with current standards 
congress has from time to time considered legislation that would amend the caa to target specific emissions from electric utility generating plants 
the epa has also proposed potential regulations associated with th ese types of emissions 
if enacted  this legislation and or regulations could require reductions in emissions of nox  so  mercury and or other pollutants 
the caa programs which most directly affect nve s electric generating facilities are described below mact the federal clean air mercury rule camr was an epa rule based on a national cap and trade system which was designed to achieve a percent reduction in mercury emissions and affecting all coal and oil fired generating units across the country greater than mws 
in  in state of new jersey v 
epa  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacated the camr as well as a rule delisting electric generating units egus from hazardous air pollutants haps requirements 
the epa then signed a consent decree in october of that requires the agency to propose the maximum achievable control technology mact rule for coal and oil fired utility units by march and issue a final version by november it is anticipated that the final mact will specify certain haps emission limits  including mercury  based on the average of the top of best performers  as determined through data collection 
the utilities are currently monitoring actual mercury emissions associated with their coal boilers and have conducted testing for other haps which was submitted in response to the epa s data collection request 
the utilities anticipate that once the final rule is released  affected facilities could be required to demonstrate compliance within three to five years 
naaqs the caa requires the epa to set minimum naaqs for certain air emissions including ozone  particulate matter  so and nitrogen dioxide no 
the caa established two types of naaqs primary standards  which set limits to protect public health  and secondary standards  which set limits to protect public welfare 
most naaqs require measurement over a defined period of time typically one hour  eight hours  twenty four hours  or one year to determine the average concentration of the pollutant present in a defined geographic area 
when a naaqs has been established  each state must recommend  and the epa must designate  the areas within its boundaries that meet naaqs attainment areas and those that do not non attainment areas 
each state must develop a state implementation plan sip to bring non attainment areas into compliance with naaqs and maintain good air quality in attainment areas 
the naaqs that affect or potentially affect our utility operations are summarized below 
ozone naaqs in march  the epa issued final rules adopting new  more stringent eight hour naaqs for ozone 
the epa lowered the primary and secondary standards from parts per billion to parts per billion 
states must submit to the epa no later than plans that demonstrate attainment with the standard 
areas must reach attainment by deadlines that vary depending on the severity of the ozone problem 
the epa announced that it expects to publish the final rule with the new ozone standards by no later than july  the las vegas clark county region is presently designated as non attainment and the attainment status of the rest of nevada will directly depend on the final ozone limit proposed by the epa 
particulate matter naaqs the epa has developed annual naaqs for coarse particulate matter defined as particles of micrometers or larger and both annual and hour naaqs for fine particulate matter particles with a size of up to micrometers 
nevada counties are currently meeting the standard 
however  the epa is currently reconsidering the annual fine particulate standard  and if lowered as expected  new non attainment designations in our service territory could occur 
the epa has indicated its reconsideration of the adequacy of the annual fine particulate standard will be completed in october so naaqs on june   the epa established a new one hour so naaqs at parts per billion and revoked the hour and annual so naaqs 
the epa expects to designate areas as attainment  non attainment  or unclassifiable in early based on the existing monitoring network and modeling 
non attainment designations are expected to result in lower so emission limits for sources of so in or near those areas 
no naaqs on january   the epa established a new one hour naaqs for no at the level of parts per billion 
to determine compliance with the new standard  the epa is establishing new ambient air monitoring requirements near major roads as well as in other locations where maximum concentrations are expected 
although existing air quality monitors do not currently show exceedances of this new standard in the utilities service areas  additional community and roadside monitoring could result in the designation of new non attainment areas 
the epa intends to re designate areas as soon as  based on the air quality data from the new monitoring network 
due to uncertainty regarding the potential stringency of any new naaqs related proposals  nve is not able to estimate cost impacts to its generating system at this time 
while the final outcome and timing for the epa and or congressional actions cannot be estimated  the utilities continue to monitor the development of these standards and assess their potential impact on our generation fleet as new information becomes available 
regional haze rules in june  the epa finalized amendments to the july regional haze rules  thereby requiring states to develop sips to demonstrate compliance 
these amendments apply to the provisions of the regional haze rule that require emission controls for industrial facilities emitting air pollutants that reduce visibility by causing or contributing to regional haze 
states are required to identify the facilities that will have to reduce emissions through installation of emission controls  known as best available retrofit technology bart  and then set emissions limits for those facilities 
in  the state of nevada began its bart rule development and the proposed sip to implement the bart requirements was released in the first quarter as presented in the sip  the impacted bart units are reid gardner generating station units   ft 
churchill generating station units  and tracy generating station units  the submitted bart sip contains targeted emission rates and compliance with the state s bart program can be achieved through options such as retrofit of emission reduction equipment on the affected units  or retirement of those units 
nevada s bart sip is awaiting a final response back from the epa 
the epa s acceptance of the sip will then allow nve to evaluate the economic profile of the impacted units and finalize the technology requirements necessary to meet the target emission rates 
climate change the topic of climate change continues to evolve  and response to this issue brings with it significant environmental  economic and social implications for nve and other electric utilities 
potential impacts from proposed legislation could vary  depending upon proposed co emission limits  the timing of implementation of those limits  the method of allocating allowances  the degree to which offsets are allowed and available  and provisions for cost containment measures  such as a safety valve that provides a ceiling price for emission allowance purchases 
however  the utilities contribution of greenhouse gases amongst its current generation fleet is partly mitigated due to our fuel portfolio being predominately natural gas which emits approximately less co than coal 
the epa finalized regulations in september that require certain categories of businesses  including fossil fuel fired power plants  to monitor and report their annual greenhouse gas emissions beginning in nve has been reporting its annual greenhouse gas emissions since it joined the california climate action registry ccar in thus  this new rule covering the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions is not expected to have a material effect on nve and the utilities operations 
after a series of developments and rule proposals  in march of  the epa affirmed its position that the caa permitting requirements under the prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v permit programs are not triggered for a pollutant until a regulatory requirement to control emissions of that pollutant becomes effective 
as a result of this epa determination  new or modified plants that are subject to psd or title v programs will have to address greenhouse gas emissions in new permit applications as of january similarly  greenhouse gases emitted above certain thresholds from existing plants would be covered under the title v program beginning in january currently  all nve generation facilities have operating permits that could require modification to comply with the rule if modifications are undertaken 
the extent to which this rule could have a material impact on our generating facilities depends upon whether physical changes or change in operations subject to the rule would occur at our generating facilities  future epa determinations on what constitutes best available control technology for greenhouse gas emissions from power plants  and whether federal legislation is passed which overrides the rule 
on december   the epa announced that it will propose first time greenhouse gas emission standards and guidelines for the power plant sector under the federal caa 
specifically  the agency expects to propose new source performance standards nsps and emissions guidelines for existing sources for the power plant sector by july  to be finalized in may it is reasonable to expect that the limits on greenhouse gas emissions imposed by the new source performance standards and guidelines for existing sources will have an impact on generating facility operations 
however  until the standards and guidelines are proposed  it is impossible to predict the potential effect on generating facility operations 
the impact on nve of future initiatives related to greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change remains unknown 
although compliance costs are unlikely to be realized in the near future  federal legislative  federal regulatory  and state and regional sponsored initiatives to control greenhouse gas emissions continue to progress  making it more likely that some form of greenhouse gas emissions control will eventually be required 
since these initiatives continue to evolve  nve has and will continue to identify projects that minimize or offset greenhouse gas emissions and believes precautionary actions to limit greenhouse gas emissions are appropriate 
further  nve continues to employ a three part strategy to meet the energy needs of nevada while concurrently reducing its carbon footprint 
this strategy includes increasing the uti lities energy efficiency and conservation programs  and expanding renewable energy initiatives and investments 
clean water act standards the epa administers rules establishing aquatic protection requirements for power generation facilities that withdraw and discharge large quantities of water from and into rivers  streams  lakes  reservoirs  estuaries  oceans  or other us waters for cooling purposes 
in consideration of the desert environment in which the utilities operate  none of the utilities generation plants employ once through cooling water intake discharge structures into public water bodies 
further  all of the utilities generation stations are designed to have either minimal or zero water discharge into the surrounding environment 
therefore  the various laws regulating once through cooling water intake structur es and thermal discharges of wastewater from power generation facilities do not specifically apply to the npc and sppc generation sites 
the epa is currently developing revised effluent limitation guidelines and standards for the steam electric power generating industry  which the agency expects to propose in june the epa revision of these guidelines is driven primarily by concern over wastewater discharges from coal fired power plants  but will also address discharges from ash ponds and flue gas desulfurization air pollution controls 
under the terms of a related court approved consent decree  the final rules must be published by january  it is reasonable to expect that the new guidelines will impose more stringent limits on wastewater discharges from coal fired power plants and ash ponds 
however  until the revised guidelines are proposed  it is impossible to predict the effect the revised guidelines may have on generatin g facility operations 
coal combustion product ccp management in may  the epa released the text of a proposed rule describing two possible regulatory options it is considering under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra for the disposal of coal ash generated from the combustion of coal by electric utilities and independent power producers 
under either option  the epa would regulate the construction of impoundments and landfills  and seek to ensure both the physical and environmental integrity of disposal facilities  however  none of the utilities coal facilities currently manage ash in surface water impoundments  rather  these ash products are handled and processed in a dry form at both the reid gardner and north valmy generating stations 
the utilities believe it is possible that the epa will continue to allow some beneficial use  such as recycling of ash  without classifying it as hazardous waste 
however  any additional regulations which more stringently regulate coal ash will likely increase costs for nve s coal generation facilities if the ability to recycle this material is impaired or current landfill disposal requirements are modified 
due to the uncertainties of how this material may ultimately be regulated in the future  the utilities are unable to predict the outcome any such regulations might have on their systems at this time 
remediation activities due to the age and or historical usage of past and present operating properties  the utilities may be responsible for various levels of environmental remediation at contaminated sites 
this can include properties that are part of ongoing utility operations  sites formerly owned or used by nve or the utilities  and or sites owned by third parties 
the responsibility to remediate typically involves management of contaminated soils and may involve groundwater remediation 
managed in conjunction with relevant federal  state and local agencies  activities vary with site conditions and locations  remedial requirements  complexity and sharing of responsibility 
if remediation activities involve statutory joint and several liability provisions  strict liability  or cost recovery or contribution acti ons  nve  the utilities or their respective affiliates could potentially be held responsible for contamination caused by other parties 
in some instances  nve or the utilities may share liability associated with contamination with other potentially responsible parties  and may also benefit from insurance policies or contractual indemnities that cover some or all cleanup costs 
these types of sites situations are generally managed in the normal course of business operations 
general employees all nve and its subsidiaries had  employees as of january   of which  were employed by npc  and  were employed by sppc 
npc and ibew  which covers approximately of npc s workforce  have signed an agreement to extend the current collective bargaining agreement cba through september  the parties will continue to discuss and negotiate over various topics during the next several months 
until that time  the current contract remains in effect as is 
on august   sppc and ibew local  which covers approximately of sppc s workforce  entered into a new cba 
the cba is effective august  for a three year period ending august  general franchises npc and sppc the utilities have non exclusive local franchises or revocable permits to carry on their business in the localities in which their respective operations are conducted in nevada 
the franchise and other governmental requirements of some of the cities and counties in which the utilities operate provide for payments based on gross revenues 
public utilities are required by law to collect from their customers a universal energy charge uec based on consumption 
the uec is designed to help those customers who need assistance in paying their utility bills or need help in paying for ways to reduce energy consumption 
during  the utilities collected million in franchise or other fees based on gross revenues 
they collected million in uec based on consumption 
they also paid and rec orded as expense million of fees based on net profits

risk factors risks related to nve and the utilities results of operations economic conditions could negatively impact our business 
our operations are affected by local  national and global economic conditions 
moreover  the growth of our business depends in part on continued customer growth and tourism demand in our service areas 
the consequences of recent national recession and continuing local recession have included a lower level of economic activity and uncertainty within the capital and commodity markets  including availability and cost of credit  inflation rates  monetary policy  unemployment rates and legislative and regulatory uncertainty 
a lower level of economic activity  changes in discretionary spending  conservation efforts by our customers  and decreased tourism activity in our service areas have resulted in a decline in energy consumption  which has and may continue to affect our future growth 
ins tability in the financial markets  as a result of the current recession or otherwise  also may affect the cost of capital and our ability to raise capital 
current economic conditions have and may continue to lead to potential increased unemployment  which may impact customers ability to pay on a timely basis  increase customer bankruptcies  and lead to increased bad debt 
it is expected that commercial and industrial customers will be impacted first with residential customers following  if such circumstances occur 
our operating results will likely fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis 
electric power generation is generally a seasonal business 
in many parts of the country  including our service areas  demand for power peaks during the hot summer months  with market prices also peaking at that time 
as a result  our operating results in the future will likely fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis 
in addition  we have historically sold less power  and consequently earned less income  when weather conditions in our service areas are milder 
unusually mild weather in the future could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition 
changes in consumer preferences  current local recessionary environment  war  and the threat of terrorism or pandemics may harm our future growth and operating results 
changes in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending in the las vegas portion of our service area could continue to harm our business 
we cannot predict the extent to which the current local recessionary environment  future terrorist and war activities  or pandemics  in the us and elsewhere may affect us  directly or indirectly 
an extended period of reduced discretionary spending and or disruptions or declines in airline and other travel and business conventions could significantly harm the businesses in and the continued growth of the las vegas portion of our service area  which could harm our business and results of operations 
risks related to nve and the utilities regulatory proceedings if the utilities do not receive favorable rulings in their future grcs or other regulatory filings  including revenue recovery programs relating to the eeir  such events may have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition  cash flows and future results of operations 
the utilities revenues and earnings are subject to change as a result of regulatory proceedings known as grcs  which the utilities file with the pucn approximately every three years 
in the utilities grcs  the pucn establishes  among other things  their recoverable rate base  their roe  overall ror  depreciation rates and their cost of capital 
for a discussion of npc s and sppc s recent grcs  see note  regulatory actions of the notes to financial statements 
we cannot predict what the pucn will direct in their orders on the utilities future grcs or other regulatory filings  including revenue recovery programs relating to the eeir 
inadequate btgr would have a significant adverse effect on the utilities financial condition and future results of operations and could cause downgrades of their securities by the rating agencies and make it significantly more difficult or expensive to finance operations and construction projects and to buy fuel  natural gas and purchased power from third parties 
if the utilities do not receive favorable rulings in the deferred energy applications that they file with the pucn and they are unable to recover their deferred purchased power  natural gas and fuel costs  including changes in prices due to temporary suspension of hedging programs  they will experience an adverse impact on cash flow and earnings 
any significant disallowance of deferred energy charges in the future could materially adversely affect their cash flow  financial condition and liquidity 
under nevada law  purchased power  natural gas and fuel costs in excess of those included in base rates are deferred as an asset on the utilities balance sheets and are not shown as an expense until recovered from their retail customers 
the utilities are required to file deaa applications with the pucn at least once every twelve months so that the pucn may verify the prudence of the energy costs 
nevada law also requires the pucn to act on these cases within a specified time period 
any of these costs determined by the pucn to have been imprudently incurred cannot be recovered from the utilities customers 
past disallowances in the utilities deferred energy cases have been significant  which resulted in ratings downgrades of our debt securities and adversely affected ou r liquidity and access to capital markets 
for a discussion of npc s and sppc s recent and pending deferred energy rate cases  see note  regulatory actions of the notes to financial statements 
material disallowances of deferred energy costs  gas costs or inadequate bters would have a significant adverse effect on the utilities financial condition and future results of operations  could cause downgrades of nve s and the utilities securities by the rating agencies and could make it more difficult or expensive to finance operations and construction projects and buy fuel  natural gas and purchased power from third parties 
the utilities purchase a portion of the power that they sell to their customers from power suppliers 
if the utilities and or their power suppliers credit ratings are downgraded  the utilities may experience difficulty entering into new power supply contracts  and to the extent that they must rely on the spot market  they may experience difficulty obtaining such power from suppliers in the spot market in light of their financial condition  or the financial condition of their power suppliers 
in addition  if the utilities experience unexpected failures or outages in their generation facilities  they may need to purchase a greater portion of the power they provide to their customers 
if access to liquidity is limited to obtain their power requirements  particularly for npc at the onset of t he summer months  and are unable to obtain power through other means  their business  operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
if the utilities cannot maintain the required level of renewable energy or procure sufficient solar energy to meet nevada s increasing portfolio standard the pucn may  among other things  impose an administrative fine for noncompliance 
nevada law sets forth the portfolio standard requiring providers of electric service to acquire  generate  or save from renewable energy systems or energy efficiency measures a specific percentage of its total retail energy sales from renewable energy sources  including biomass  geothermal  solar  waterpower  wind  and recovered energy generation projects 
in the utilities were required to obtain an amount of pecs equivalent to of their total retail energy from renewables 
the portfolio standard increases to for and  to for and  and reaches in  after which it increases again to for the years through  and to for and beyond 
moreover  not less than of the total portfolio standard must be met from solar resources until  when a minimum of must be solar 
in the event the utilities do not fully meet the standard in a given year  if the pucn does not exempt them  they will be required to make up the pec deficiency in subsequent years 
due to periodic increases in the portfolio standard and increasing retail sales  the utilities must acquire increasing amounts of renewable energy 
the utilities success in meeting the increasing portfolio standard remains largely dependent on their ability to acquire additional renewable energy from either self owned renewable generation facilities or the purchase of renewable energy from third party developers or other utilities and through qualified conservation and energy efficiency measures 
in  the pucn issued an order allowing npc to offset its credit shortfall with credits earned in and a loan of surplus credits from sppc 
the utilities ability to access the capital markets is dependent on their ability to obtain regulatory approval to do so 
the utilities will need to continue to support working capital and capital expenditures  and to refinance maturing debt  through external financing 
the utilities must obtain regulatory approval in nevada in order to borrow money or to issue securities and are therefore dependent on the pucn to issue favorable orders in a timely manner to permit them to finance their operations  construction and acquisition costs and to purchase power and fuel necessary to serve their customers 
on october   the pucn issued an order authorizing npc to restate and utilize its available authority to issue up to million of additional long term debt securities  to refinance up to approximately million of long term debt se curities  said authority to expire on december   and ongoing authority to maintain a revolving credit facility of up to billion 
on october   the pucn approved financing authority for sppc to issue up to million of long term debt securities over a three year period ending december   ongoing authority to maintain a revolving credit facility of up to million  and authority to refinance up to approximately million of long term debt securities 
however  we cannot assure you that in the future the pucn will issue such favorable orders or that such favorable orders will be issued on a timely basis 
risks related to nve and the utilities environmental matters if federal and or state requirements are imposed on the utilities mandating further emission reductions  including greenhouse gases and other pollutants  or if national ambient air quality standards are modified  such requirements could make some electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate 
emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides  mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulations  controls and mitigation expenses 
certain congressional leaders  environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the united states have also been focusing considerable attention on co emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change and or regional air quality compliance 
moreover  there are many legislative and rulemaking initiatives pending at the federal and state level that are aimed at the reduction of fossil plant emissions  as well as modification of the naaqs for ozone and other pollutants 
we cannot predict the outcome of pending or fu ture legislative and rulemaking proposals 
future changes in environmental laws or regulations governing emissions reductions could make certain electric generating units  especially those utilizing coal for fuel  uneconomical to construct  maintain or operate or could require design changes or the adoption of new technologies that could significantly increase costs or delay in service dates 
in addition  any legal obligation that would require the utilities to substantially reduce their emissions beyond present levels could require extensive mitigation efforts and  in the case of co legislation or regulation  would raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels  particularly coal  as an energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities 
the utilities are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that may increase our cost of operations  impact or limit our business plans  expose us to environmental liabilities  or make some electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate 
the utilities are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations can result in increased capital  construction  operating  and other costs 
these laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses  permits  inspections and other approvals  and may be enforced by both public officials and private individuals 
we cannot predict the outcome or effect of any action or litigation that may arise from applicable environmental regulations 
in addition  either of the utilities may be identified as a responsible party for environmental cleanup by environmental agencies or regulatory bodies 
we cannot predict with certainty the amount or timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs 
there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties 
environmental regulations may also require us to install pollution control equipment at  or perform environmental remediation on  our facilities 
existing environmental regulations regarding air emissions such as nox  so or mercury emissions  water quality and other toxic pollutants may be revised or new climate change laws or regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us 
revised or additional laws or regulations  which may result in increased compliance costs  including the adoption of new technologies or additional operating restrictions  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers 
furthermore  we may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary to our business 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if we fail to obtain  maintain or comply with any such approval  operations at our affected facilities could be delayed  halted or subjected to additional costs 
risks related to nve and the utilities liquidity and capital resources the utilities plan to make capital expenditures to complete construction of generation and transmission facilities 
in addition  the utilities require liquidity to bridge the cost of fuel and purchased power and other operating activities until recovered through rates 
if we are unable to finance such construction or limit the amount of capital expenditures associated with those facilities to forecasted levels  finance or generate sufficient liquidity for fuel and purchased power including  risk management activities  and or recover amounts spent on construction  fuel and purchased power and other operating activities through future filings with the pucn  and or maintain our credit ratings  our financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 
our long term business objectives include plans to complete the construction of generation and transmission facilities 
significant construction capital requirements and liquidity to bridge the cost of fuel and purchased power and other operating activities  until recovered through rates  require that the utilities may finance through additional borrowings under the utilities respective credit facilities  through additional debt financings in private or public offerings or through debt or equity financings by nve 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  nve 
currently  access to the capital markets is not a limiting factor  however  if significant new capital requirements are requested and approved  we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms  or at all  since the availability and terms of financing depend on financial market conditions  including the effect of volatility in financial and credit markets  changes in availability and cost of capital either due to market conditions or as a result of the utilities credit ratings  or interest rate fluctuations 
neither can we be sure that we will be successful in limiting capital expenditures to planned amounts  particularly in the event of escalating costs for materials  labor and environmental compliance  timing delays and other economic factors 
if we cannot obtain favorable financing arrangements for our planned capital expenditures  limit such capital expenditures to fo recasted amounts  finance or generate sufficient liquidity for fuel and purchased power  including risk management activities and other operating costs  and or recover or timely recover amounts spent on construction  fuel and purchased power and other operating activities through future filings with the pucn  and or maintain our credit ratings  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
lower than expected investment returns on pension and other postretirement plan assets and other factors may increase nve s pension and other postretirement plan liability and funding requirements 
substantially all of nve employees are covered by a single employer defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan 
at present  the pension and other postretirement plan is underfunded in that the projected benefit obligations exceed the aggregate fair value of plan assets 
the funded status of the plan can be affected by contributions to plan assets  plan design  investment returns on plan assets  discount rates  mortality rates of plan participants  pension reform legislation and a number of other factors 
there can be no assurance that the value of nve s pension and other postretirement plan assets will be sufficient to cover future liabilities 
although nve has made significant contributions to its pensio n and other postretirement plan in recent years  it is possible that nve could incur a significant pension and other postretirement liability adjustment  or could be required to make significant additional cash contributions to its plan  which would reduce the cash available for operating activities  and have a material impact on earnings 
refer to note  retirement plan and post retirement benefits of the notes to financial statements 
the utilities are subject to fuel and wholesale electricity pricing risks  which could result in unanticipated liabilities and cash flow requirements or increased volatility in our earnings  and to related credit and liquidity risks 
the utilities business and operations are subject to changes in purchased power prices and fuel costs that may cause increases in the amounts they must pay for power supplies on the wholesale market and the cost of producing power in their generation plants 
prices for electricity  fuel and natural gas may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and expose the utilities to significant commodity price risks 
among the factors that could affect market prices for electricity and fuel are prevailing market prices for coal  oil  natural gas and other fuels used in generation plants  including associated transportation costs  and supplies of such commodities  changes in the regulatory framework for the commodities markets that they rely on for purchased power and fuel  liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market  the actions of external parties  such as the ferc or independent system operators  that may impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the western energy markets  weather conditions impacting demand for electricity or availability of hydroelectric power or fuel supplies  union and labor relations  natural disasters  wars  acts of terrorism  embargoes and other catastrophic events  and changes in federal and state energy and environmental laws and regulations 
effective october  the utilities hedging programs were suspended  therefore  fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on their cash flows and their ability to operate and  consequently  on our financial condition 
increasing energy commodity prices  particularly with respect to natural gas  have a significant effect on our short term liquidity 
although the utilities are entitled to recover their prudently incurred power  natural gas and fuel costs through deferred energy rate case filings with the pucn  if current commodity prices increase  the utilities deferred energy balances will increase  which will negatively affect our cash flow and liquidity until such costs are recovered from customers 
the utilities are also subject to credit risk for losses that they incur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations to deliver fuel  purchased power  natural gas for resale or settlement payments 
the utilities often extend credit to counterparties and customers and they are exposed to the risk that they may not be able to collect amounts owed to them 
credit risk includes the risk that a counterparty may default due to circumstances relating directly to it  and also the risk that a counterparty may default due to circumstances that relate to other market participants that have a direct or indirect relationship with such counterparty 
should a counterparty  customer or supplier f ail to perform  the utilities may be required to replace existing contracts with contracts at then current market prices or to honor the underlying commitment 
the utilities are also subject to liquidity risk resulting from the exposure that their counterparties perceive with respect to the possible non performance by the utilities of their physical and financial obligations under their energy  fuel and natural gas contracts 
these counterparties may under certain circumstances  pursuant to the utilities agreements with them  seek assurances of performance from the utilities in the form of letters of credit  prepayment or cash deposits  or reduce availability under the utilities revolving credit facilities for negative mark to market positions 
in periods of price volatility  the utilities exposure levels can change significantly  which could have a significant negat ive impact on our liquidity and earnings 
in the event the utilities credit ratings are downgraded below investment grade  the maximum amount of collateral the utilities would be required to post is approximately million 
additionally  the utilities shall reduce their availability under their revolving credit facilities for negative mark to market positions on hedging contracts with counterparties who are lenders under the revolving credit facilities provided that the reduction of availability under the revolving credit facilities shall at no time exceed of the total commitments then in effect under the credit facilities 
the calculation of npc s and sppc s negative mark to market exposure as of november  was approximately million and million  respectively  which amount was in effect for borrowings during the month of december currently  the utilities only have hedging contracts with counterparties who are also lenders on the revolving credit facilities  however  future contracts entered into with non lenders may require the utilities to post cash collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade 
as of february   npc had approximately million available under its million revolving credit facility and sppc has approximately million available under its million revolving credit facility  which includes reductions for hedging transactions and letters of credits 
if nve is precluded from receiving dividends from the utilities  its financial condition  and its ability to meet its debt service obligations  pay dividends and make capital contributions to its subsidiaries  will be materially adversely affected 
since nve is a holding company  substantially all of its cash flow is provided by dividends paid to nve by npc and sppc on their common stock  all of which is owned by nve 
since npc and sppc are public utilities  they are subject to regulation by state utility commissions  which impose limits on investment returns or otherwise impact the amount of dividends that the utilities may declare and pay 
in addition  certain agreements entered into by the utilities set restrictions on the amount of dividends they may declare and pay and restrict the circumstances under which such dividends may be declared and paid 
as a result of the utilities credit rating on their senior secured debt at investment grade by s p and moody s  these restrictions are suspended and no longer in effect so long as the debt remains investment grade by both rating agencies 
in addition to the restrictions imposed by specific agreements  the federal power act prohibits the payment of dividends from capital accounts 
although the meaning of this provision is unclear  the utilities believe that the federal power act restriction  as applied to their particular circumstances  would not be constr ued or applied by the ferc to prohibit the payment of dividends for lawful and legitimate business purposes from current year earnings  or in the absence of current year earnings  from other additional paid in capital accounts 
if  however  the ferc were to interpret this provision differently  the ability of the utilities to pay dividends to nve could be jeopardized 
we cannot assure investors that future dividend payments on our common stock will be made or  if made  in what amounts they may be paid 
dividends are considered periodically by nve s bod and are subject to factors that ordinarily affect dividend policy  such as current and prospective financial condition  earnings and liquidity  prospective business conditions  regulatory factors  and dividend restrictions in nve s and the utilities financing agreements 
the bod will continue to review these factors on a periodic basis to determine if and when it would be prudent to declare a dividend on nve s common stock  however  there is no guarantee that dividends will be paid in the future  or that  if paid  the dividends will be paid in the same amount or with the same frequency as in the past 
nve s indebtedness is effectively subordinated to the liabilities of its subsidiaries  particularly npc and sppc 
nve and the utilities have the ability to issue a significant amount of additional indebtedness under the terms of their various financing agreements 
because nve is a holding company  its indebtedness is effectively subordinated to the utilities existing indebtedness and other future liabilities  including claims by the utilities trade creditors  debt holders  secured creditors  taxing authorities  and guarantee holders 
nve conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiaries  and thus nve s ability to meet its obligations under its indebtedness and to pay any dividends on its common stock will be dependent on the earnings and cash flows of those subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to nve 
as of december   the utilities had approximately billion of debt outstanding 
the terms of nve s indebtedness restrict the amount of additional in debtedness that nve and the utilities may issue 
based on nve s december  financial statements  assuming an interest rate of  nve s indebtedness restrictions would allow nve and the utilities to issue up to approximately billion of additional indebtedness in the aggregate  unless the indebtedness being issued is specifically permitted under the terms of nve s indebtedness 
in addition  npc and sppc are subject to restrictions under the terms of their various financing agreements on their ability to issue additional indebtedness

item legal proceedings npc and sppc western united states energy crisis proceedings before the ferc ferc complaints in december  the utilities filed ten complaints with the ferc against various power suppliers  including enron  under section of the federal power act seeking price reduction of forward wholesale power purchase contracts entered into prior to the ferc mandated price caps imposed in june in reaction to the western united states energy crisis 
the utilities contested the amounts paid for power actually delivered as well as termination claims for undelivered power against terminating suppliers

executive overview management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations explains the general financial condition and the results of operations of nve and its two primary subsidiaries  npc and sppc  collectively referred to as the utilities references to we  us and our refer to nve and the utilities collectively  and includes discussion of the following critical accounting policies and estimates recent pronouncements for each of nve  npc and sppc results of operations analysis of cash flows liquidity and capital resources regulatory proceedings utilities nve s utilities operate three regulated business segments which are npc electric  sppc electric and sppc natural gas 
the utilities are public utilities engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity and  in the case of sppc  sale of natural gas 
other operations consist mainly of unregulated operations and the holding company operations 
the utilities are the principal operating subsidiaries of nve and account for substantially all of nve s assets and revenues 
nve  npc and sppc are separate filers for sec reporting purposes and as such this discussion has been divided to reflect the individual filers nve  npc and sppc  except for discussions that relate to all three entities or the utilities 
the utilities are regulated by the pucn and  for the california electric service territory of sppc  the cpuc  with respect to rates  standards of service  siting of and necessity for generation and certain transmission facilities  accounting  issuance of securities and other matters with respect to generation  distribution and transmission operations 
however  in january   sppc sold its california assets as discussed further in note  assets held for sale  in the notes to financial statements  therefore  sppc will no longer be subject to regulation by the cpuc 
the ferc has jurisdiction under the federal power act with respect to wholesale rates  service  interconnection  accounting  and other matters in connec tion with the utilities sale of electricity for resale and interstate transmission 
the ferc also has jurisdiction over the natural gas pipeline companies from which the utilities take service 
as a result of regulation  many of the fundamental business decisions of the utilities  as well as the ror they are permitted to earn on their utility assets  are subject to the approval of governmental agencies 
the utilities revenues and operating income are subject to fluctuations during the year due to impacts that seasonal weather  rate changes  and customer usage patterns have on demand for electric energy and resources 
npc is a summer peaking utility experiencing its highest retail energy sales in response to the demand for air conditioning 
sppc s electric system peak typically occurs in the summer  while its gas business typically peaks in the winter 
the variations in energy usage due to varying weather  customer growth and other energy usage patterns  including dsm programs and energy efficiency and conservation measures  necessitates a continual balancing of loads and resources and purchases and sales of energy under short and long term contracts 
as a result  the prudent ma nagement and optimization of available resources has a direct effect on the operating and financial performance of the utilities 
additionally  the timely recovery of purchased power and fuel costs  and other costs  and the ability to earn a fair return on investments are essential to the operating and financial performance of the utilities 
overview of major factors affecting results of operations nve recognized net income of million in compared to million in the increase in net income is primarily due to an increase in gross margin  which is primarily due to npc s increased rates as a result of npc s grc  effective july  see note  segment information  of the notes to financial statements 
also contributing to the increase in net income was lower operating expenses in compared to primarily due to a decrease in employee pension and benefit expenses and costs incurred in related to severance programs 
see note  severance programs  of the notes to financial statements 
partially offsetting the in crease in net income was higher income taxes as a result of a lower tax effective rate in  an increase in interest expense on regulatory items primarily as a result of over collected deferred energy balances and interest charges related to nve s redemption of million of its senior notes due  and million of its senior notes due and increased depreciation expense 
nve recognized net income of million in compared to million in npc s gross margin increased million  primarily due to increased rates as a result of npc s grc  effective july  sppc s electric gross margin increased million while its gas gross margin remained relatively flat 
sppc s electric gross margin increased primarily due to sppc s grc  effective july  consolidated net income decreased primarily due to an increase in other operating and maintenance expenses  depreciation and interest charges  some of which are costs related to the purchase of the higgins generating station and the construction of the clark peaking units  which were not included in rates prior to july  and a decrease in afudc  partially offset by higher revenues 
also contributing to the decrease in net income were severance costs as a result of nve s reduction in workforce  discussed further in note  severance programs  of the notes to financial statements 
accomplishments in  nve continued its execution of its three part strategy  discussed in detail later  to manage resources against our load by encouraging energy efficiency and conservation programs  the purchase and development of renewable energy projects  and the construction of generating facilities  in an effort to reduce our reliance on purchased power  and expansion of transmission capabilities 
accomplishments under the three part strategy include energy efficiency and conservation programs npc s irp  approved in july  includes various dsm programs to increase energy efficiency and conservation programs totaling approximately million over a three year period 
sppc s irp  approved in october  includes approximately million in dsm programs 
in march of  nve was awarded a million grant in stimulus funding  made available through the american recovery and reinvestment act  from the doe specifically for nve s million nv energize project 
in august of  the pucn approved the project 
in september  the grant was increased to million and nve committed to a million total project budget in order to include the development of a consumer confidence plan 
the project will deploy the smart grid infrastructure necessary to enable the achievement of metering and customer service operating savings  enable the expansion of demand response and energy efficiency benefits  and provide customers better information to help manage their energy usage 
purchase and development of renewable energy resources npc completed construction of the goodsprings mw nominally rated recovered energy project at its budgeted cost of million 
npc received pucn approval for seven long term renewable energy ppas totaling mws  in addition to two short term renewable ppas 
in april  npc and sppc filed their joint annual compliance report with the pucn 
sppc reported that it met the portfolio standard for total pecs and the solar requirements of the portfolio standard 
npc reported that it met the solar requirement of the portfolio standard  but did not meet the portfolio standard requirement for total pecs 
however  in october  the pucn approved a stipulation that allowed npc to offset its pec shortfall with credits earned in and a loan of surplus credits from sppc 
construction of generating facilities and expansion of transmission capabilities in  construction of the mw nominally rated natural gas generating station at the existing harry allen generating station continued with an expected completion by mid the pucn granted the utilities request to move forward with the construction of on line with gbt  as discussed later in more detail 
in august  the utilities and gbt finalized a tua  which was closed in february other major accomplishments in included the adoption of regulations by the pucn authorizing an electric utility to recover revenue attributable to reduced kwh sales related to our energy efficiency programs 
see note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements for further details 
operating results benefitted from continued cost management  including the effects of the severance program which began in and lower pension costs 
in addition  during  the utilities reduced their capital expenditures 
during  sppc continued to receive the required regulatory approvals needed to consummate its sale of certain california assets to cal peco  which was completed on january  see note  assets held for sale  of the notes to financial statements for further details 
future challenges nve and the utilities must balance the needs of our customers and regulatory requirements while still continuing to provide value to our shareholders 
challenges arising from the need to balance these elements include but are not limited to economic conditions in nevada and its effect on various interrelated factors including  but not limited to customer growth  customer usage  revenues  pressure on regulators to limit necessary rate increases or otherwise lessen rate impacts upon customers  load factors  future capital projects and capital requirements  managing operating and maintenance expenses within projected revenue growth without compromising safety  reliability and efficiency  our liquidity and ability to access capital markets  collections on accounts receivable  and counterparty risk 
meeting the portfolio standard  which requires that the utilities obtain of their energy from renewable resources in and  increasing to by  and  future execution of the three part strategy  including the impact of economic conditions  rate impacts on customers and any future legislative or regulatory requirements 
full and timely recovery of regulatory costs 
economic conditions in npc s service territory  which consists primarily of las vegas  key economic indicators  as outlined below  continue to decline or have shown little improvement from unemployment in las vegas was in december  up from a year ago  in southern nevada  construction activity  another leading indicator  has seen a decrease in the number of commercial permits while residential permits has remained relatively flat  construction employment has decreased as of november compared to november  as of november  taxable sales have increased from a year ago  as of december gaming revenues have declined from a year ago  as of december visitor volume increased from a year ago  as of december  the hotel motel occupancy rate in las vegas has increased approximately from a year ago  and the estimated room growth rate in was primarily due to the cosmopolitan resort and casino which added approximately  rooms 
in  room growth is expected to increase by and then slow to in in sppc s service territory  which consists primarily of washoe county  key economic indicators  as outlined below  continue to decline or have shown little improvement from unemployment in washoe county was at as of december  up from a year ago  construction employment decreased as of november from november  as of november  taxable sales increased compared to a year ago  and as of december  gaming revenues decreased compared to a year ago 
other economic conditions affecting nevada include the national decrease in real estate market activity which makes it more difficult for individuals and businesses to sell their properties in order to relocate to nevada 
gaming properties in southern nevada are experiencing financial problems  including difficulties meeting debt payments  bankruptcies and delays or termination of construction projects which may further decrease the projected growth in rooms or offset any increases 
the portfolio standard the portfolio standard as set forth by nevada law requires a specific percentage of an electric service provider s total retail energy sales be obtained from renewable resources 
renewables include biomass  geothermal  solar  waterpower  wind and qualified recovered energy generation projects 
in and  the utilities are required to obtain an amount of pecs equivalent to of their total retail energy from renewables 
currently  the portfolio standard increases to for and and reaches in after which it increases to for the years through  and to for and beyond 
moreover  not less than of the total portfolio standard must be met from solar resources until when a minimum of must be solar 
the portfolio standard  discussed above  allows energy efficiency measures from qualified conservation programs to meet up to of the portfolio standard 
under this provision  a pec is created for each kwh of energy conserved by qualified energy efficiency programs 
in addition  energy saved during peak demand hours earns double the pecs for each kwh of energy conserved 
after the dsm percentage allowance is fully utilized  nve s strategy is to assess economic conditions and potential rate impacts in pursuing the implementation of cost effective dsm programs needed to achieve future portfolio standard requirements 
the successful execution of the three part strategy  as discussed below  will be critical to our ability to meet the portfolio standard 
three part strategy the continued execution of the three part strategy which began in to manage resources against our load by encouraging energy efficiency and conservation programs  the purchase and development of renewable energy projects  and construction of generating facilities in an effort to reduce our reliance on purchased power and expansion of transmission capability will be critical to nve s ability to meet its state mandated portfolio standard 
energy efficiency and conservation programs as stated above  the portfolio standard allows energy efficiency measures from qualified conservation programs to meet up to of the portfolio standard 
as such  nve remains committed to investing in such programs that qualify toward the portfolio standard  reduce our peak load  especially during peak periods  and are cost effective 
nve s current budget includes approximately million for energy efficiency and conservation programs 
furthermore  the utilities will continue with the implementation of nv energize which will provide nve with the smart grid infrastructure necessary to enable enable the achievement of metering and customer service operating savings  enable the expansion of demand response and energy efficiency benefits  and provide customers better information to help manage their energy usage 
purchase and development of renewable energy resources nve faces a significant challenge as it strives to balance the need to meet the portfolio standard  with the changes in load forecast and the uncertainty of renewable energy project development  either for financial or resource related reasons  with renewable energy providers 
however  nve remains committed to renewable energy and continues to seek cost effective opportunities that will benefit our state  customers and environment 
depending on its needs  during npc may issue requests for proposals for renewable energy contracts  explore opportunities to either jointly construct or pursue the development of projects using wind  geothermal and solar  or undertake additional short term purchases 
construction of generating and transmission facilities and optimizing the operation of current generation assets npc is scheduled to complete construction of the mw nominally rated natural gas generating station at the existing harry allen generating station  and it is expected to be operational by mid in february  nve and the utilities consummated their agreement with gbt to jointly construct and own on line  a kv transmission line 
the completion of on line  expected in late  will connect nve s southern and northern service territories and will provide the ability to jointly dispatch energy throughout the state and provide access to isolated renewable energy resources in parts of northern and eastern nevada  which will enhance nve s ability to meet its portfolio standard  discussed above  and lower costs to our customers 
on line is a joint project between the utilities and gbt  an affiliate of ls power 
the joint project consists of two phases 
in phase of the joint project  the parties would complete construction of an initial kv interconnection between the robinson summit substation on the sppc system and the harry allen generating station on the npc system by late under the joint project  the utilities will own a interest in phase and enter into a transmission use agreement with gbt for its interest in phase the utilities interest in phase of the joint project  which approximates million  will be allocated and to npc and sppc  respectively 
the utilities will have rights to of the capacity of phase  which is estimated at approximately mw 
if g bt elects to construct phase  it would construct two additional transmission segments at either end of on line one extending from robinson summit north to midpoint  idaho  and the other commencing at the harry allen generating station and interconnecting south to the eldorado substation 
gbt would pay for and own of phase facilities 
however  npc and sppc would have rights to additional transmission capacity from midpoint to eldorado for a total of approximately mw based on a rating of  mw for the complete path 
in  nve will have more generating capacity than its forecasted load requirement 
however  the additional resources  may be affected by  but not limited to  the unplanned retirement of aging or less efficient generating stations  the timing or achievement of commercial operation in regards to renewable energy power purchases not yet commercially operable  as well as the intermittent reliability of renewable energy resources  customer behavior with respect to dsm programs and environmental regulation  which may limit our ability to operate certain generating units 
as such  the additional resources provide the utilities the ability to maintain a reliable level of energy 
nve s management continuously optimizes the utilities energy portfolios in order to meet load obligations in a cost effective an d reliable manner 
full and timely recovery of regulatory costs the utilities are required to file rate cases every three years to adjust general rates that include their cost of service and return on investment in order to more closely align earned returns with those allowed by regulators 
in addition  the utilities are required to file a triennial irp which is a comprehensive plan that considers customer energy requirements and proposes the resources to meet that requirement 
resource additions approved by the pucn in the resource planning process are deemed prudent for ratemaking purposes 
between irp filings  the utilities may seek pucn approval for modifications to their resource plans and for power purchases 
the utilities remain focused on communicating with regulators the necessity of investments to better serve our customers  the prudency of the costs incurred  and the importance of a reasonable return on investment for our shareholders 
management cannot predict the future decisions on our rate cases  but believe the regulatory process  described above  coupled with prudent management provides a reasonable basis for the recovery of our investments 
goals management cannot predict when economic recovery may occur in nevada  but expects that the nevada economy will continue to struggle for the next several years 
as such  our primary goals will focus on meeting the challenges discussed above  by continuing to monitor economic conditions in nevada and adjusting our business decisions accordingly  meeting the portfolio standard in and building a sustainable foundation for future requirements by continuing to meet system deployment milestones in order to achieve nv energize project completion by  continued investment in energy efficiency and conservation programs  the purchase and development of cost effective renewable energy projects  construction of on line  completion of expansion at the harry allen generating station  optimizing generating assets  and full and timely recovery of regulatory costs  in particular  npc s grc to be filed in june critical accounting policies and estimates nve prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
in doing so  certain estimates were made that were critical in nature to the results of operations 
the following discusses those significant estimates that may have a material impact on the financial results of nve and the utilities and are subject to the greatest amount of subjectivity 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of nve bod 
the items discussed below represent critical accounting estimates that under different conditions or using different assumptions could have a material effect on the financial condition  results of operation  cash flows  liquidity and capital resou rces of nve and the utilities 
regulatory accounting the utilities retail rates are currently subject to the approval of the pucn and are designed to recover the cost of providing generation  transmission and distribution services 
nve is a holding company under the public utility holding company act of puhca 
as a result  nve and all of its subsidiaries whether or not engaged in any energy related business are required to maintain books  accounts and other records in accordance with ferc regulations and to make them available to the ferc and the pucn 
in addition  the pucn or the ferc have the authority to review allocations of costs of non power goods and administrative services among nve and its subsidiaries 
the ferc has the authority generally to require that rates subject to its jurisdiction be just and reas onable and in this context would continue to be able to  among other things  review transactions between nve  npc and or sppc and or any other affiliated company 
as a result  the utilities qualify for the application of regulatory accounting treatment as allowed by the regulated operations topic of the fasc 
the accounting guidance for regulated operations recognizes that the rate actions of a regulator can provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset and requires the capitalization of incurred costs that would otherwise be charged to expense where it is probable that future revenue will be provided to recover these costs 
the accounting guidance prescribes the method to be used to record the financial transactions of a regulated entity 
the criteria for applying the accounting guidance for regulated operations include the following i rates are set by an independent third party regulator  ii approved rates are intended to recover the specific costs of the regulated products or services  and iii rates that are set at levels that will recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers 
under federal law  wholesale rates charged by the utilities are subject to certain jurisdictional regulation  primarily by the ferc 
the ferc has jurisdiction under the federal power act with respect to rates  service  interconnection  accounting  and other matters in connection with the utilities sale of electricity for resale and interstate transmission 
the ferc also has jurisdiction over the natural gas pipeline companies from which the utilities take service 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because it is probable they will be recovered through future rates collected from customers 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections for costs that are not likely to be incurred 
although current rates do not include the recovery of all existing regulatory assets as discussed further below and in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to financial statements  management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery either because we have received prior pucn approval or due to regulatory precedent set for similar circumstances 
management s judgment reflects the c urrent political and regulatory climate in the state  and is subject to change in the future 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the write off of regulatory assets would be required to be recognized as a charge and expensed in current period earnings 
regulatory accounting affects other critical accounting policies  including deferred energy accounting  accounting for pensions  and accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  all of which are discussed immediately below 
deferred energy accounting under deferred energy accounting  to the extent actual fuel and purchased power costs exceed fuel and purchased power costs recoverable through current rates  the excess is not recorded as a current expense on the statement of operations but rather is deferred and recorded as an asset on the balance sheet 
conversely  a liability is recorded to the extent fuel and purchased power costs recoverable through current rates exceed actual fuel and purchased power costs 
these excess amounts are reflected in adjustments to rates and recorded as revenue or expense in future time periods  subject to pucn approval 
nevada law provides that the pucn may not allow the recovery of any costs for purchased fuel or purchased power that were the result of any practice or transaction that was undertaken  managed or performed imprudently by the electric utility 
nevada law specifies that fuel and purchased power costs include all costs incurred to purchase fuel  to purchase capacity  and to purchase energy 
both utilities are entitled under statute to utilize deferred energy accounting for their electric operations and both utilities accumulate amounts in their deferral of energy costs accounts 
the utilities also record  and are eligible under the statute to recover  a carrying charge on such deferred balances  recognized as interest income expense on regulatory items in the current period 
the utilities are exposed to commodity price risk primarily related to changes in the market price of electricity  and the suspension of our hedging program  as well as changes in fuel costs incurred to generate electricity 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for a discussion of the utilities purchased power procurement strategies  and commodity price risk and commodity risk management program 
currently  commodity price increases and decreases are recoverable through the deferred energy accounting mechanism  with no anticipated effect on earnings 
however  the utilities are subject to regulatory risk related to commodity price changes due to the fact that the pucn may disallow recovery for any of thes e costs that it considers imprudently incurred 
see note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements  for additional discussion of the regulatory process to recover these deferred costs 
accounting for derivatives and hedging activities nve  npc and sppc apply the accounting guidance as required by the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasc 
the accounting guidance for derivative instruments requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value  unless they meet the normal purchase normal sale scope exception 
the accounting for derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivatives and the resulting designation 
fuel and purchased power contracts in order to manage loads  resources and energy price risk  the utilities may enter into forward contracts to purchase or sell a specified amount of energy at a specified time or during a specified period in the future 
in addition  the utilities use over the counter options with financial institutions and other energy companies to manage price risk which are typically considered derivatives under the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasc and are marked to market in the statement of financial position unless the contract qualifies for the normal purchases or sales scope exception per the accounting guidance for derivative instruments 
the pucn has authorized the utilities to defer the recognition of mark to market gains and losses on energy commodity transactions that would otherwise be recorded to the income statement and or comprehensive income  until the period of settlement by recording a risk management regulatory asset or liability 
upon settlement of these transactions  actual gains and losses are recognized as fuel and purchased power costs 
interest rate swap contracts nve  npc  and sppc are subject to risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business 
as such  management may enter into interest rate swaps to manage fixed interest rate exposure with variable interest rate instruments in order to lower overall borrowing costs 
if the conditions required by the regulated operations topic of the fasc are met  the utilities are permitted to defer the change in fair value of the interest rate swap as risk management regulatory asset liability 
fair value measurements and disclosures nve and the utilities follow the fair value measurements and disclosure topic of the fasc  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 
fair value measurements and disclosure topic of the fasc establishes a three level hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the three levels are defined as follows level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
level primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange traded derivatives and listed equities 
level observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant 
as required by the fair value measurements and disclosure topic of the fasc  financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
nve and the utilities assessment of the significance of a particular input to fair value measurements requires judgment 
the fair value of the utilities assets and liabilities are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis 
the use of different assumptions and variables in determining fair value could significantly impact the valuation and classification within the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities 
see note  summary of significant accounting policie s  note  investments and other property  note  derivatives and hedging activities and note  retirement plan and post retirement benefits in the notes to financial statements for more detailed disclosure of nve s  npc s and sppc s fair value measurements 
accounting for income taxes current and deferred income tax provisions and benefits as well as deferred income tax assets and liabilities involve significant management estimates and judgments 
nve and the utilities file a consolidated federal income tax return 
current income taxes are allocated based on nve and the utilities respective taxable income or loss and tax credits as if each utility filed a separate return 
nve and the utilities recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are also recorded for deductions incurred and credits earned that have not been utilized in tax returns filed or to be filed for tax years through the date of the financial statements 
management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
if it is not more likely th an not that a deferred tax asset will be realized in its entirety  a valuation allowance is recorded with respect to the portion estimated not likely to be realized 
management has determined that the federal nol does not require a valuation allowance based on projections of future taxable income and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities 
at december   nve had a gross federal nol carryover of million 
the following table summarizes the nol and tax credit carryovers and associated carryover periods  and valuation allowance for amounts which nve has determined that realization is unlikely as of december  dollars in thousands deferred valuation net deferred expiration tax asset allowance tax asset period federal nol research and development credit arizona state coal credits total actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items  including changes in income tax laws  our financial condition and results of operations in future periods  and the review of filed tax returns by taxing authorities 
nve and the utilities income tax returns are regularly audited by applicable tax authorities 
tax benefits associated with income tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  in a tax return are recorded only when the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied and measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
nve and the utilities classify interest and penalties associated with unrec ognized tax benefits as interest and other expense  respectively  within the income statement 
no interest expense or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded 
as of december   nve and the utilities recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions of approximately million 
the utilities reduce rates to reflect the current tax benefits associated with recognizing certain tax deductions sooner than when the expenses are recognized for financial reporting purposes 
a regulatory asset is recorded for these amounts to reflect the future increases in income taxes payable that will be recovered from customers when these temporary differences reverse 
the utilities have been fully normalized since afudc equity is recorded on an after tax basis 
accordingly  a regulatory asset is recorded when afudc equity is recognized 
this regulatory asset reverses as the related plant is depreciated  resulting in an increase to the tax provision 
the utilities also record regulatory liabilities for obligations to reduce rates charged customers for deferred taxes recovered from c ustomers in prior years at corporate tax rates higher than the current tax rates 
the reduction in rates charged customers will occur as the temporary differences resulting in the excess deferred tax liabilities reverse 
nve and subsidiaries had a net regulatory tax liability of million at december  environmental contingencies nve and its subsidiaries are subject to federal  state and local regulations governing air and water quality  hazardous and solid waste  land use and other environmental considerations 
nevada s utility environmental protection act requires approval of the pucn prior to construction of major utility  generation or transmission facilities 
the epa  ndep and clark county department of air quality and environmental management administer regulations involving air and water quality  solid  and hazardous and toxic waste 
nve and its subsidiaries are subject to rising costs that result from a steady increase in the number of federal  state and local laws and regulations designed to protect the environment 
these laws and regulations can result in increased capital  operating  and other costs as a result of compliance  remediation  containment and monitoring obligations  particularly with laws relating to power plant emissions 
in addition  nve or its subsidiaries may be a responsible party for environmental cleanup at any site identified by a regulatory body 
the management of nve and its subsidiaries cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs and compliance and the possibility that changes will be made to current environmental laws and regulations 
there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties 
depending on whether environmental liabilities occurred from normal operations or as part of new environmental laws  the utilities accrue for environmental remediation liabilities in accordance with the accounting guidance required by the asset retirement and environmental obligations topic of the fasc 
estimated costs from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study or when the accounting requirements for environmental obligations have been met 
such costs are adjusted as additional information develops or circumstances change 
certain environmental costs receive regulatory accounting treatment  under which the costs are recorded as regulatory assets 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other partie s are recognized when their receipt is deemed probable 
environmental expenditures that have future economic benefits are capitalized in accordance with our asset capitalization policy 
note  summary of significant accounting policies  asset retirement obligations  of the notes to financial statements and note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to financial statements  discusses the environmental matters of nve and its subsidiaries that have been identified  and the estimated financial effect of those matters 
to the extent that actual results differ from the estimated financial effects  there are environmental matters not yet identified for which nve or its subsidiaries are determined to be responsible  or the utilities are unable to recover through future rates the costs to remediate such environmental matters  there could be a material adverse effect on the financial condition and future liquidity and results of operations of nve and its subsidiaries 
defined benefit plans and other post retirement plans as further explained in note  retirement plan and post retirement benefits of the notes to financial statements  nve maintains a qualified pension plan  a non qualified supplemental executive retirement plan serp and restoration plan  as well as a post retirement benefit opeb plan which provides health and life insurance for retired employees 
pension plans nve s reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits described in note  retirement plan and post retirement benefits of the notes to financial statements are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions for future experience 
in accordance with the compensation retirement benefits topic of the fasc  changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
as such  significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants 
furthermore  the compensation retirement benefits topic of the fasc requires the immediate recognition of changes in benefit obligations due to differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
however  since nve recovers costs through rates  amounts recovered in rates will be recorded as other regulatory assets under the provisions of the regulated operations topic of the fasc  and will be recognized as expense over a period of time 
for the years ended december    and  nve recorded pension expense for all pension plans of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  in accordance with the accounting guidance as defined by the compensation retirement benefits topic of the fasc 
actual payments of benefits made to retirees and terminated vested employees for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age and employment periods  the level of contributions nve makes to the plan  and earnings on plan assets 
changes made to the provisions of the plan may also impact current and future pension costs 
pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key ac tuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets  the discount rates and demographic mortality  retirement  termination assumptions used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 
in june  the preservation of access to care for medicare beneficiaries and pension relief act of was signed into law 
this legislation permits employers to choose between alternative amortization methods for shortfalls due to losses in asset market values 
the legislation is designed to reduce contributions to defined benefit pension plans by allowing them to be spread them over a longer period of time 
nve is currently evaluating the options and impact of this legislation  but does not believe it would need to avail itself of the benefits under this act 
nve has not taken into account any possible impacts of this legislation in determining estimated future contributions 
plan assets nve s pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
see note  retirement and post retirement benefits  of the notes to financial statements  for further discussion on nve s investment strategy and asset allocation

other post retirement benefit costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age and employment periods  the level of contributions made to the plan  earnings on plan assets  and health care cost trends 
changes made to the provisions of the plan may also impact current and future other post retirement benefit costs 
other post retirement benefit costs may also be significantly affected by c hanges in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets  discount rates and demographic mortality  retirement  termination assumptions used in determining the post retirement benefit obligation and post retirement costs 
in march  the president signed into law comprehensive health care reform legislation under the patient protection and affordable care act of one feature of this legislation is the elimination of the tax deductibility of employer health care costs for retiree prescription drug expenses that are reimbursed as part of the medicare part d federal subsidy 
nve has not participated in the subsidy program since  and therefore does not expect any significant impact on its financial statements as a result of this legislation 
plan assets nve s other post retirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns  as well as  changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased other post retirement benefit costs in future periods

at the end of each month  the energy delivered to the customers from the date of their last meter read to the end of the month is estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated 
these estimates of unbilled sales and revenues are based on the ratio of billable days versus unbilled days  amount of energy procured and generated during that month  historical customer class usage patterns  line loss and the utilities current tariffs

alternative revenues as adopted by the pucn in july  the utilities are authorized to recover lost revenue that is attributable to the measurable and verifiable effects associated with the implementation of efficiency and conservation programs approved by the pucn 
the utilities account for the effects of such regulation in accordance with fasc  alternative revenue programs which permits the recording of revenue if all of the following conditions are met the program allows for automatic adjustment of future rates  the amount of revenues is objectively determinable and probable of recovery and the additional revenues will be collected within months 
see note  regulatory actions  eeir  of the notes to financial statements for further discussion on the recording of such revenues 
the measurable and verifiable effects associated with the implementation of efficiency and conservation programs are complex calculations that require the utilities to estimate the amount of kwh savings 
the amount of kwh savings is based on numerous assumptions and statistical data  which are verified by an independent third party  but still requires verification by the pucn 
the utilities revenues may be impacted to the extent that kwh savings approved by the pucn differ from the amounts estimated

nv energy  inc 
results of operations nv energy  inc holding company and other subsidiaries nve holding company the holding company s stand alone operating results included approximately million  million and million of interest costs for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in interest costs for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily due to the early redemption of million in the aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  and approximately million in the aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and the issuance of million senior notes  due the decrease in interest costs for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily due to debt redemptions in see note  long term debt of the notes to financial statements  for further discussion of debt transactions 
other subsidiaries other subsidiaries of nve  except for npc and sppc  did not contribute materially to the consolidated results of operations of nve 
nv energy  inc consolidated see executive overview  overview of major factors affecting results of operations for nve consolidated 
analysis of cash flows nve s cash flows increased during compared to due to an increase in cash from operating activities and a decrease in cash used by investing activities  offset by a decrease in cash from financing activities 
cash from operating activities 
the increase in cash from operating activities is primarily due to increased revenues as a result of the rate increase in npc s grc and decreased fuel and purchased power costs  offset by bter  weca and deaa rate reductions  a decrease in funding for pension plans  an increase in spending on energy conservation programs  and a refund to a transmission customer in cash used by investing activities 
cash used by investing activities decreased mainly due to the slowdown in construction for infrastructure  and proceeds from the sale of property 
cash from financing activities 
cash from financing activities decreased primarily due to the redemption of sppc s general and refunding mortgage notes  series h due in an aggregate principal amount of million  a decrease in debt issuance at npc  an increase in payments on npc s revolving credit facility  and higher dividend payments 
liquidity and capital resources nve consolidated overall liquidity nve s consolidated operating cash flows are primarily derived from the operations of npc and sppc 
the primary source of operating cash flows for the utilities is revenues including the recovery of previously deferred energy costs and natural gas costs from sales of electricity and  in the case of sppc  natural gas 
significant uses of cash flows from operations include the purchase of electricity and natural gas  other operating expenses  capital expenditures and interest 
operating cash flows can be significantly influenced by factors such as weather  regulatory outcomes  and economic conditions 
available liquidity as of december  was as follows in millions available liquidity as of december  in millions nve npc sppc cash and cash equivalents balance available on revolving credit facilities n a less reduction for hedging transactions n a as of february   npc and sppc had approximately million and million available under their revolving credit facilities  which includes reductions in availability for hedging transactions and letters of credits  as discussed further under npc s and sppc s financing transactions 
reduction for hedging transactions reflects balances as of november  nve and the utilities attempt to maintain their cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid investments  such as us treasury bills and bank deposits 
in addition to cash on hand  the utilities may use their revolving credit facilities in order to meet their liquidity needs 
alternatively  depending on the usage of their revolving credit facilities  the utilities may issue debt  subject to certain restrictions as discussed in factors affecting liquidity  ability to issue debt  below 
nve and sppc have no significant debt maturities in either or however  npc s debt maturities in and include its million general and refunding notes  series a  which mature on june  and its million general and refunding notes  series i  which mature on april  in addition  npc is required to redeem approximately million of its variable rate debt  due  prior to on line s commercial operation date  expected in late nve and the utilities anticipate that they will be able to meet short term operating costs  such as fuel and purchased power costs  with internally generated funds  including the recovery of deferred energy  and the use of their revolving credit facilities 
furthermore  in order to fund long term capital requirements and maturing debt obligations  nve and the utilities will use a combination of internally generated funds  the utilities revolving credit facilities  the issuance of long term debt and or equity and  in the case of the utilities  capital contributions from nve 
however  if energy costs rise at a rapid rate and the utilities do not recover the cost of fuel  purchased power and operating costs in a timely manner or the utilities were to experience a credit rating downgrade resulting in the posting of collateral as discussed below under gas supplier matters and financial gas hedges  the amount of liquidity available to the utilities could be significantly less 
in order to maintain sufficient liquidity  nve and the utilities may be required to delay capital expenditures  re finance debt or issue equity at nve 
the ability to issue debt  as discussed later  is subject to certain covenant calculations which include net income of nve and the utilities 
as a result of these covenant calculations and the seasonality of the utilities business  the ability to issue debt can vary from quarter to quarter and the utilities utilization of their revolving credit facilities may be limited 
in  the utilities credit ratings on their senior secured debt remained at investment grade see credit ratings below 
in  nve and the utilities did not experience any limitations in the credit markets nor do we expect any in however  disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to nve or the utilities may affect their ability to access funding sources or cause an increase in the interest rates paid on newly issued debt 
as of february   nve has approximately million payable of debt service obligations remaining for  which it intends to pay through dividends from subsidiaries 
see factors affecting liquidity dividends from subsidiaries below 
on february   sppc declared a dividend payable to nve of million 
nve designs operating and capital budgets to control operating costs and capital expenditures 
in addition to operating expenses  nve has continuing commitments for capital expenditures for construction  improvement and maintenance of facilities 
detailed below are nve s capital structure  capital requirements  recently completed financing transactions and factors affecting our ability to obtain debt on favorable terms  including the effect of our holding company structure and limitation on dividends from the utilities 
capital structure nve s actual capital structure on a consolidated basis was as follows at december dollars in thousands amount percent of total capitalization amount percent of total capitalization current maturities of long term debt long term debt shareholders equity total capital requirements construction expenditures nve s consolidated cash requirements for construction expenditures for are projected to be million 
nve s consolidated cash requirements for construction expenditures for are projected to be billion 
cash used by investing activities for the years ended   and were approximately million  million  and billion  respectively 
to fund future capital projects  nve and the utilities may meet such financial obligations with a combination of internally generated funds  the use of the utilities revolving credit facilities  the issuance of long term debt  and if necessary  the issuance of equity by nve 
estimated construction expenditures for pucn approved projects  projects under contract  compliance projects and other base capital requirements are as follows dollars in thousands total year electric facilities generation distribution transmission other total gas facilities distribution other total common facilities total total estimated cash requirements related to construction projects consist of the following dollars in thousands total year construction expenditures afudc net salvage cost of removal net customer advances and ciac total cash requirements contractual obligations nve consolidated the table below provides nve s contractual obligations on a consolidated basis  as of december   except as otherwise indicated that nve expects to satisfy through a combination of internally generated cash and  as necessary  through the issuance of short term and long term debt 
certain contracts contain variable factors which required nve to estimate the obligation depending on the final variable amount 
actual amounts could differ 
the table does not include estimated construction expenditures described above  except for major capital projects for which the utilities have executed contracts by december   or funding requirements under pension and other post retirement benefit plans  as discussed in note  retirement plan and p ost retirement benefits of the notes to financial statements  as of december  additionally  at december   nve has recorded an uncertain tax liability of million in accordance with the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes topic of the fasc all of which is classified as non current 
nve is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash payments to relevant tax authorities  consequently  none of the uncertain tax liability is included in the contractual obligations table below dollars in thousands payment due by period thereafter total npc sppc long term debt maturities npc sppc long term debt interest payments nve long term debt maturities nve long term debt interest payments purchased power purchase power not commercially operable coal and natural gas transportation long term service agreements capital projects operating leases capital leases total contractual cash obligations related party purchase power agreements have been eliminated for the years and upon completion of on line  expected in late  the related party purchase power agreements will no longer be required

included is the tua with gbt of which npc is responsible for and sppc and is contingent upon final construction costs and reaching commercial operation  which is expected in late amounts based on estimated usage 
capital projects include construction costs at the harry allen generating station and nv energize and npc s requirement to purchase the undepreciated cost of capital of reid gardner from cdwr 
additionally  the utilities  as joint owners  have obligations regarding the construction of on line  of which npc will be responsible for and sppc 
pension and other postretirement benefit plan matters nve has a qualified pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan which cover substantially all employees of nve  npc and sppc 
the annual net benefit cost for the plans is expected to decrease in by approximately million compared to the cost of million 
as of december   the measurement date  the plan was under funded under the provisions of the compensation retirement benefits topic of the fasc 
refer to note  retirement plan and post retirement benefits  of the notes to financial statements 
during  nve funded a total of million to the trusts established for these plans 
at the present time it is not expected that additional funding will be required in to meet the minimum funding level requirements defined by the p ension protection act of however  nve and the utilities have included in their assumptions funding levels similar to the funding 
the amounts to be contributed in may change subject to market conditions 
financing transactions nve holding company senior notes in november  nve issued and sold million of its senior notes  due of the approximately million in net proceeds  million was used in december to redeem the approximately million in the aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  and the approximately million in the aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes were redeemed at a purchase price of  for each  principal amount of the notes  plus accrued interest 
the notes were redeemed at a purchase price of  for each  principal amount of the notes  plus accrued interest 
the remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
factors affecting liquidity ability to issue debt certain debt of nve holding company places restrictions on debt incurrence  liens and dividends  unless  at the time the debt is incurred  the ratio of cash flow to fixed charges for nve s consolidated most recently ended four quarter period on a pro forma basis is at least to under this covenant restriction  as of december   nve consolidated would be allowed to incur up to billion of additional indebtedness  assuming an interest rate of 
the amount of additional indebtedness allowed would likely be impacted if there is a change in current market conditions or material change in our financial condition 
notwithstanding this restriction  under the terms of the debt  npc and sppc would still be permitted to incur a combined total of up to million in indebtedness and letters of credit under their respective revolving credit facilities 
as of december   the combined total outstanding indebtedness and letters of credit under their respective revolving credit facilities was approximately million 
see npc s and sppc s ability to issue debt sections for further discussion of the utilities limitations on ability to issue debt 
if the applicable series of nve debt is upgraded to investment grade by both moody s and s p  these restrictions will be suspended and will no longer be in effect so long as the applicable series of nve notes remain investment grade by both moody s and s p see credit ratings above 
effect of holding company structure as of december   nve on a stand alone basis has outstanding debt and other obligations including  but not limited to million of its unsecured senior notes due  and million of its unsecured senior notes due due to the holding company structure  nve s right as a common shareholder to receive assets of any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is junior to the claims against the assets of such subsidiary by its creditors 
therefore  nve s debt obligations are effectively subordinated to all existing and future claims of the creditors of npc and sppc and its other subsidiaries  including trade creditors  debt holders  secured creditors  taxing authorities and guarantee holders 
as of december   nve  npc  sppc and their subsidiaries had approximately billion of debt and other obligations outstanding  consisting of approximately billion of debt at npc  approximately billion of debt at sppc and approximately million of debt at the holding company and other subsidiaries 
although nve and the utilities are parties to agreements that limit the amount of additional indebtedness they may incur  nve and the utilities retain the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness and other liabilities 
certain nve debt agreements contain covenants that limit the amount of restricted payments  including dividends that may be made by nve 
however  permitted payments  under these covenant calculations  exceeds retained earnings  as a result  retained earnings was free from any dividend restrictions as of december  dividends from subsidiaries since nve is a holding company  substantially all of its cash flow is provided by dividends paid to nve by npc and sppc on their common stock  all of which is owned by nve 
since npc and sppc are public utilities  they are subject to regulation by state utility commissions  which impose limits on investment returns or otherwise impact the amount of dividends that the utilities may declare and pay 
in addition  certain agreements entered into by the utilities set restrictions on the amount of dividends they may declare and pay and restrict the circumstances under which such dividends may be declared and paid 
as a result of the utilities credit rating on their senior secured debt at investment grade by s p and moody s  these restrictions are suspended and no longer in effect so long as the debt remains investment grade by both rating agencies 
in addition to the restrictions imposed by specific agreements  the federal power act prohibits the payment of dividends from capital accounts 
although the meaning of this provision is unclear  the utilities believe that the federal power act restriction  as applied to their particular circumstances  would not be construed or applied by the ferc to prohibit the payment of dividends for lawful and legitimate business purposes from current year earnings  or in the absence of current year earnings  from other additional paid in capital accounts 
if  however  the ferc were to interpret this provision differently  the ability of the utilities to pay dividends to nve could be jeopardized 
credit ratings the liquidity of nve and the utilities  the cost and availability of borrowing by the utilities under their respective credit facilities  the potential exposure of the utilities to collateral calls under various contracts and the ability of the utilities to acquire fuel and purchased power on favorable terms are all directly affected by the credit ratings for the companies debt 
npc s and sppc s senior secured debt is rated investment grade by three nrsro s fitch  moody s and s p 
as of december   the ratings are as follows rating agency fitch moody s s p nve sr 
unsecured debt bb ba bb npc sr 
secured debt bbb baa bbb npc sr 
unsecured debt bb not rated bb sppc sr 
secured debt bbb baa bbb investment grade fitch s  moody s and s p s rating outlook for nve  npc and sppc is stable 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
security ratings are subject to revision and withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
each security rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings  and  accordingly  each rating should be evaluated in the context of the applicable methodology  independently of all other ratings 
the rating agencies provide ratings at the request of the company being rated and charge the company fees for their services 
energy supplier matters with respect to npc s and sppc s contracts for purchased power  npc and sppc purchase and sell electricity with counterparties under the wspp agreement  an industry standard contract that npc and sppc use as members of the wspp 
the wspp contract is posted on the wspp website 
under these contracts  a material adverse change  which includes a credit rating downgrade  in npc and sppc may allow the counterparty to request adequate financial assurance  which  if not provided within three business days  could cause a default 
most contracts and confirmations for purchased power have been modified or separate agreements have been made to either shorten the normal payment due date or require payment in advance of delivery in response to requests for financial assurance 
a default must be declared within days of the event  giving rise to the default becoming known 
a default will result in a termination payment equal to the present value of the net gains and losses for the entire remaining term of all contracts between the parties aggregated to a single liquidated amount due within three business days following the date the notice of termination is received 
the mark to market value  which is substantially based on quoted market prices  can be used to roughly approximate the termination payment and benefit at any point in time 
the net mark to market value as of december  for all suppliers continuing to provide power under a wspp agreement would approximate a million payment or obligation to npc 
no amounts would be due to or from sppc 
these contracts qualify for the normal purchases scope exception as required by the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasc  and as such  are not required to be marked to market on the balance sheet 
refer to note  derivatives and hedging activities  of the notes to financial statements  for further discussion 
gas supplier matters with respect to the purchase and sale of natural gas  npc and sppc use several types of standard industry contracts 
the natural gas contract terms and conditions are more varied than the electric contracts 
consequently  some of the contracts contain language similar to that found in the wspp agreement and other agreements have unique provisions dealing with material adverse changes  which primarily means a credit rating downgrade below investment grade 
most contracts and confirmations for natural gas purchases have been modified or separate agreements have been made to either shorten the normal payment due date or require payment in advance of delivery in response to requests for financial assurances 
forward physical gas supplies are purchased under index based pricing terms and as such do not carry fo rward mark to market exposure 
gas transmission service is secured under ferc tariffs or custom agreements 
these service contracts and tariffs require the user to establish and maintain creditworthiness to obtain service or otherwise post cash or a letter of credit to be able to receive service 
service contracts are subject to ferc approved tariffs  which  under certain circumstances  require the utilities to provide collateral to continue receiving service 
npc has one transmission counterparty for which it is required to post cash collateral or a letter of credit in the event of credit rating downgrades 
as of december   the maximum amount of additional collateral npc would be required to post under these contracts in the event of credit rating downgrades was approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million would be required if npc s senior unsecured ratings are downgraded from their current level and an additional amount of approximately million would be required if npc s senior secured ratings are downgraded to below investment grade 
financial gas hedges the utilities enter into certain hedging contracts with various counterparties to manage the gas price risk inherent in purchased power and fuel contracts 
as discussed under npc s and sppc s financing transactions  the utilities shall reduce their availability under the utilities revolving credit facilities for net negative mark to market positions on hedging contracts with counterparties who are lenders under the revolving credit facilities provided that the reduction of availability under the revolving credit facilities shall at no time exceed of the total commitments then in effect under the credit facilities 
the calculation of npc s and sppc s negative mark to market exposure as of november  was approximately million and million  respectively  which amount was in effect for borrowings during the month of december currently  the utilities only have hedging contracts with counterparties who are also lenders on the revolving credit facilities  however  future contracts entered into with non lenders may require the utilities to post cash collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade 
finally  in october  the utilities have suspended their hedging program  as such  expect their exposure to negative mark to market hedging transactions to decline 
cross default provisions none of the utilities financing agreements contains a cross default provision that would result in an event of default by that utility upon an event of default by nve or the other utility under any of their respective financing agreements 
certain of nve s financing agreements  however  do contain cross default provisions that would result in an event of default by nve upon an event of default by the utilities under their respective financing agreements 
in addition  certain financing agreements of each of nve and the utilities provide for an event of default if there is a failure under other financing agreements of that entity to meet payment terms or to observe other covenants that would result in an acceleration of payments due 
most of these default provisions other than ones relating to a failure to pay other indebtedness provide for a cure period of days from the occurrence of a specified event  during which time nve or the utilities may rectify or correct the situation before it becomes an event of default 
nevada power company results of operations npc recognized net income of million in compared to net income of million in and million in in npc paid dividends to nve of approximately million 
details of npc s operating results are further discussed below 
gross margin is presented by npc in order to provide information that management believes aids the reader in determining how profitable the electric business is at the most fundamental level 
gross margin  which is a non gaap financial measure as defined in accordance with sec rules  provides a measure of income available to support the other operating expenses of the business and is a key factor utilized by management in its analysis of its business 
npc believes presenting gross margin allows the reader to assess the impact of npc s regulatory treatment and its overall regulatory environment on a consistent basis 
gross margin  as a percentage of revenue  is primarily impacted by the fluctuations in electric and natural gas supply costs versus the fixed rates collected from customers 
while these fluctuating costs impact gross margin as a percentage of revenue  they only impact gross margin amounts if the costs cannot be passed through to customers 
gross margin  which npc calculates as operating revenues less energy costs  provides a measure of income available to support the other operating expenses of npc 
for reconciliation to operating income  see note  segment information of the notes to financial statements 
gross margin changes are based primarily on general base rate adjustments which are required by statute to be filed every three years 
the components of gross margin for the years ended december dollars in thousands amount change from prior year amount change from prior year amount operating revenues energy costs fuel for power generation purchased power deferred energy gross margin gross margin increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to an increase in btgr revenue as a result of npc s grc effective july  partially offsetting the increase in gross margin was a decrease in usage per customer due to conservation programs  economic conditions and hotter than normal weather in may npc s gross margin increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  primarily due to an increase in btgr revenue as a result of npc s grc  effective july   and a slight increase in average customer growth 
partially offsetting the increase was a change in customer usage patterns which may be attributable to economic conditions  conservation programs  and the termination of various transmission service agreements

also contributing to the decrease was a decrease in customer usage due to conservation programs  economic conditions and hotter than normal weather in may these decreases were partially offset by increases in general rates as a result of npc s grc  effective july   see note  regulatory actions of the notes to the financial statements 
average residential  commercial  and industrial customers increased by  and  respectively 
npc s retail revenues increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  primarily due to increases in rates as a result of npc s grc effective july   partially offset by decreased rates as a result of npc s various bter quarterly cases and deferred energy cases 
for further discussions on npc s various rate cases see note  regulatory actions of the notes to the financial statements 
the overall rate increase was partially offset by decreased usage caused by changes in customer usage patterns  which may be attributable to economic conditions and or conservation efforts  and cooler summer weather during average residential  commercial  and industrial customers increased by  and  respectively  compared to prior year 
other operating revenues decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease is primarily due to the expiration of a significant transmission agreement with calpine energy services and decreases in sales for resale 
other operating revenues decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease is primarily due to the termination of several transmission agreements  including a transmission agreement related to the higgins generating station which was purchased by npc in october energy costs energy costs include fuel for generation and purchased power 
energy costs are dependent upon several factors which may vary by season or period 
as a result  npc s usage and average cost per mwh of fuel for generation versus purchased power to meet demand can vary significantly

fuel for generation costs increased for the year ended december  primarily due to higher cost of natural gas and the change in the method of allocating electric tolling option expense between fuel for generation and purchased power which had no impact on gross margin or operating income  partially offset by a decrease in volume and a decrease in costs associated with hedging activities 
mwhs generated decreased for the year ended december  primarily due to planned outages within internal generation in the early part of the year

deferred energy amount change from prior year amount change from prior year amount deferred energy deferred energy represents the difference between actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred during the period and amounts recoverable through current rates 
to the extent actual costs exceed amounts recoverable through current rates  the excess is recognized as a reduction in costs 
conversely to the extent actual costs are less than amounts recoverable through current rates  the difference is recognized as an increase in costs 
deferred energy also includes the current amortization of fuel and purchased power costs previously deferred 
see note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements for further detail of deferred energy balances 
amounts for  and include amortization of deferred energy of million  million and million  respectively  and an over collection of amounts recoverable in rates of million and million in and  respectively  and an under collection of million in other operating expenses amount change from prior year amount change from prior year amount other operating expense maintenance expense depreciation and amortization other operating expense decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to lower employee pension and benefit expenses  costs incurred in related to severance programs  as discussed further in note  severance programs  of the notes to financial statements and a reduction in bad debt expense 
in addition  other operating expenses decreased as a result of costs associated with the repr 
beginning in  these amounts are reported net of their related operating expense  as such  repr amounts no longer effect operating expense 
in and  repr costs were not material and were included in operating expenses with a correspond ing amount recorded to revenues and had no effect on net income 
the decrease was partially offset by increases in amortization of dsm programs and higher operating leases 
other operating expense increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to higher pension and other post retirement benefit expenses  costs related to severance programs  as discussed further in note  severance programs  of the notes to financial statements  costs associated with renewable energy programs  amortization of new dsm programs  higher operating leases and operating expenses for the higgins generating station acquired in october maintenance expense increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to termination of a long term service agreement and maintenance at the higgins  harry allen and silverhawk generating stations 
this increase was partially offset by planned maintenance outages that occurred in at the reid gardner and clark generating stations 
maintenance expense increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  due to the addition of the higgins generating station and increased scheduled maintenance for navajo  lenzie and silverhawk generating stations in  partially offset by lower maintenance cost for the reid gardner generating station  attributable to a major turbine overhaul in depreciation and amortization expenses increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to regular system growth 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  as a result of increases in plant in service  primarily due to the completion of the clark peaking units and the addition of the higgins generating station in the latter part of interest expense amount change from prior year amount change from prior year amount interest expense net of afudc debt   and  interest expense decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily due to the expiration in of amortization costs related to debt issues and redemptions  an increase in afudc due to construction at the harry allen generating station  lower interest on variable rate debt and the partial redemption of series a in december and the redemptions of series a  b  c  and d in october partially offsetting this decrease was higher credit facility balances in  and increased interest expense due to the issuance of million  series v  general and refunding mortgage notes in march and the issuance of million  series x  general and refunding mortgage notes in september see note  long te rm debt  for further discussion 
interest expense increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily due to the issuance of the following debt million series s general and refunding mortgage notes in july million series u general and refunding mortgage notes in january  and million series v general and refunding mortgage notes in march partially offsetting this increase was lower interest on variable rate debt  interest charges related to irs income tax settlements in  interest expense associated with refunds for construction advances in  lower afudc debt during construction due to the completion of the clark peaking units in the latter part of and the expiration in of amortization of costs related to debt issues and redemptions 
other income expense amount change from prior year amount change from prior year amount interest income expense on regulatory items afudc equity other income other expense the change in interest income expense on regulatory items for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  is primarily due to over collected deferred energy balances 
see note  regulatory actions  for further details of deferred energy balances 
interest income expense on regulatory items decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in due to lower carrying charges associated with npc s western energy crisis rate case  which began june   and overall lower deferred energy balances 
see note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements for further details of deferred energy balances 
afudc equity increased for the year ended december  compared to primarily due to construction at the harry allen generating station 
afudc equity decreased for the year ended december  compared to primarily due to completion of clark peaking units 
other income decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  due to settlement gains for outstanding legal matters in associated with the natural gas provider case  as discussed further in note  commitments and contingencies of the notes to financial statements 
this decrease was partially offset by higher interest income on investments in other income increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in due to the settlement of outstanding legal matters associated with the natural gas provider case  as discussed further in note  commitments and contingencies in the notes to financial statements  and interest received on income tax refunds 
these were partially offset by expiration of the amortization of gains associated with the disposition of property  lower interest income on investments and income earned in as a result of the settlement with calpine  and the subsequent gain on sale of the stock received  as discussed further in note  commitments and contingencies in the notes to financial statements 
other expense decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to charges in resulting from npc s grc in  a disallowance related to contract pricing for energy in  partially offset by adjustments for the settlement of the deferred energy rate case in other expense increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily due to adjustments resulting from npc s grc and a disallowance related to contract pricing for energy 
the increase in other expense was partially offset by lower advertising expenses in analysis of cash flows npc s cash flows increased during compared to due to an increase in cash from operating activities and a reduction in cash used for investing activities  partially offset by a decrease in cash from financing activities 
cash from operating activities 
the increase in cash from operating activities is primarily due to increased revenues as a result of the rate increase in npc s grc  decreased purchased power costs  a decrease in funding for pension plans  and a refund to a transmission customer in  partially offset by bter  weca and deaa rate reductions 
cash used by investing activities 
cash used by investing activities decreased mainly due to the slowdown in construction for infrastructure  and proceeds from the sale of property 
cash from financing activities 
cash from financing activities decreased primarily due to a reduction in the issuance of debt compared to and an increase in payments on npc s revolving credit facility  partially offset by lower dividend payments to nve 
liquidity and capital resources overall liquidity npc s primary source of operating cash flows is electric revenues  including the recovery of previously deferred energy costs 
significant uses of cash flows from operations include the purchase of electricity and natural gas  other operating expenses  capital expenditures and the payment of interest on npc s outstanding indebtedness 
operating cash flows can be significantly influenced by factors such as weather  regulatory outcome  and economic conditions 
available liquidity as of december  was as follows in millions available liquidity as of december  npc cash and cash equivalents balance available on revolving credit facility less reduction for hedging transactions as of february   npc had approximately million available under its revolving credit facility which includes reductions for hedging transactions and letters of credits  as discussed below under financing transactions 
reduction for hedging transactions reflects balances as of november  npc attempts to maintain its cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid investments  such as us treasury bills and bank deposits 
in addition to cash on hand  npc may use its revolving credit facility in order to meet its liquidity needs 
alternatively  depending on the usage of the revolving credit facility  npc may issue debt  subject to certain restrictions as discussed in factors affecting liquidity  ability to issue debt  below 
npc s significant debt maturities in and include its million general and refunding notes  series a  which mature on june  and its million general and refunding mortgage notes  series i  which mature april  in addition  npc is required to redeem approximately million of its variable rate debt  due  prior to on line s commercial operation date  expected in late as of february   npc has no borrowings on its revolving credit facility  not including letters of credit 
npc anticipates that it will be able to meet short term operating costs  such as fuel and purchased power costs  with internally generated funds  including recovery of deferred energy  and the use of its revolving credit facility 
furthermore  in order to fund long term capital requirements and maturing debt obligations  npc will use a combination of internally generated funds  its revolving credit facility  the issuance of long term debt and or capital contributions from nve 
however  if energy costs rise at a rapid rate and npc does not recover the cost of fuel and purchased power in a timely manner  if operating costs are not recovered in a timely manner or npc were to experience a credit rating downgrade resulting in the posting of collateral as discussed below under gas supplier matters and financial gas hedges  the amount of liquidity available to npc could be significantly less 
in order to maintain sufficient liquidity  npc may be required to further delay capital expenditures  re finance debt or obtain funding through an equity issuance by nve 
the ability to issue debt  as discussed later  is subject to certain covenant calculations which include consolidated net income of nve and the utilities 
as a result of these covenant calculations and the seasonality of the utilities business  the ability to issue debt can vary from quarter to quarter  and the utilities may not be able to fully utilize the availability on their revolving credit facilities 
in  npc s credit ratings on its senior secured debt remained at investment grade see credit ratings below 
in  npc did not experience any limitations in the credit markets  nor does npc expect any significant limitations in however  disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to npc may affect its ability to access funding sources or cause an increase in the interest rates paid on newly issued debt 
in  npc paid dividends to nve of approximately million 
npc designs operating and capital budgets to control operating costs and capital expenditures 
in addition to operating expenses  npc has continuing commitments for capital expenditures for construction  improvement and maintenance of facilities 
detailed below are npc s capital structure  capital requirements  recently completed financing transactions and factors affecting liquidity  including our ability to obtain debt on favorable terms 
capital structure npc s actual consolidated capital structure was as follows at december dollars in thousands amount percent of total capitalization amount percent of total capitalization current maturities of long term debt long term debt shareholder s equity total capital requirements construction expenditures npc s cash requirement for construction expenditures for is projected to be million 
npc s cash requirements for construction expenditures for through are projected to be billion 
cash used by investing activities for the years ended  and were approximately million  million and billion  respectively 
to fund future capital projects  npc may meet such financial obligations with a combination of internally generated funds  the use of its revolving credit facilities  the issuance of long term debt  and if necessary  capital contributions from nve 
contractual obligations the table below provides npc s consolidated contractual obligations  as of december   that npc expects to satisfy through a combination of internally generated cash and  as necessary  through the issuance of short term and long term debt 
certain contracts contain variable factors which required npc to estimate the obligation depending on the final variable amount 
actual amounts could differ 
the table does not include estimated construction expenditures described above  except for major capital projects for which npc has executed contracts by december  additionally  at december   npc has recorded an uncertain tax liability of million as required by the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes topic of the fasc  all of which is classified as non current 
npc is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash payments to relevant tax authorities  consequently  none of the uncertain tax liability is included in the contractual obligations table below dollars in thousands payment due by period thereafter total long term debt maturities long term debt interest payments purchased power purchase power not commercially operable coal and natural gas transportation long term service agreements capital projects operating leases capital leases total contractual cash obligations represents estimated payments under renewable energy power purchase contracts  which have been approved by the pucn and are contingent upon the developers obtaining commercial operation and their ability to deliver energy 
includes the tua with gbt which is contingent upon final construction costs and reaching commercial operation  which is expected in late amounts based on estimated usage 
capital projects include construction costs at the harry allen generating station and nv energize and npc s requirement to purchase the undepreciated cost of capital of reid gardner from cdwr 
additionally  npc  as a joint owner  has obligations regarding the construction of on line 
pension and other postretirement benefit plan matters nve has a qualified pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan which cover substantially all employees of nve  npc and sppc 
the annual net benefit cost for the plans is expected to decrease in by approximately million compared to the cost of million 
as of december   the measurement date  the plan was under funded under the provisions of the compensation retirement benefits topic of the fasc 
refer to note  retirement plan and post retirement benefits  of the notes to financial statements 
during  nve funded a total of million to the trusts established for these plans 
at the present time it is not expected that additional funding will be required in to meet the minimum funding level requirements defined by the p ension protection act of however  nve and the utilities have included in their assumptions funding levels similar to the funding 
the amounts to be contributed in may change subject to market conditions 
financing transactions general and refunding mortgage notes  series x in september  npc issued and sold million of its general and refunding mortgage notes  series x  due of the approximately million in net proceeds  million was used in october  to redeem i approximately million in aggregate principal amount of fixed rate unsecured tax exempt local furnishing two county bonds issued for npc s benefit and ii approximately million unsecured tax exempt pollution control refunding revenue bonds issued for npc s benefit 
the remaining net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay amounts outstanding under npc s revolving credit facility 
million revolving credit facility in april  npc terminated its million secured revolving credit facility which would have expired in november and replaced it with a million secured revolving credit facility  maturing in april the fees on the million revolving credit facility for the unused portion and on the amounts borrowed have increased from the prior facility reflecting current market conditions 
the administrative agent for the facility remains wells fargo bank  national association formerly wachovia bank  national association 
the rate for outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility will be at either an applicable base rate defined as the highest of the prime rate  the federal funds rate plus of 
and the libor base rate plus plus a margin  or a libor rate plus a margin 
the margin varies based upon npc s credit rating by s p and moody s 
currently  npc s applicable base rate margin is and the libor rate margin is 
the rate for outstanding letters of credit will be at the libor rate margin plus a fee for the issuing bank 
the million revolving credit facility contains a provision which reduces the availability under the credit facility by the negative mark to market exposure for hedging transactions with credit facility lenders or their energy trading affiliates 
the reduction in availability limits the amount that npc can borrow or use for letters of credit and would require that npc prepay any amount in excess of that limitation 
the amount of the reduction is calculated by npc on a monthly basis  and after calculating such reduction  the npc credit agreement provides that the reduction in availability under the revolving credit facility to npc shall not exceed of the total commitments then in effect under the revolving credit facility 
the npc credit agreement contains one financial maintenance covenant that requires npc to maintain a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capital  determined as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  not to exceed to in the event that npc did not meet the financial maintenance covenant or there is an event of default  the npc credit agreement would restrict dividends to nve 
moreover  so long as npc s senior secured debt remains rated investment grade by s p and moody s in each case  with a stable or better outlook  a representation concerning no material adverse change in npc s business  assets  property or financial condition would not be a condition to the availability of credit under the facility 
in the event that npc s senior secured debt ratin g were rated below investment grade by either s p or moody s  or investment grade by either s p or moody s but with a negative outlook  a representation concerning no material adverse change in npc s business  assets  property or financial condition would be a condition to borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
factors affecting liquidity ability to issue debt npc s ability to issue debt is impacted by certain factors such as financing authority from the pucn  financial covenants in its financing agreements and revolving credit facility agreements  and the terms of certain nve debt 
as of december   the most restrictive of the factors below is the pucn authority 
as such  npc may issue up to million in long term debt  in addition to the use of its existing credit facility 
however  depending on nve s or sppc s issuance of long term debt or the use of the utilities revolving credit facilities  the pucn authority may not remain the most restrictive factor 
the factors affecting npc s ability to issue debt are further detailed below a 
financing authority from the pucn as of december   npc has financing authority from the pucn for the period ending december   consisting of authority to issue additional long term debt securities of up to million  to refinance up to approximately million of long term debt securities  and ongoing authority to maintain a revolving credit facility of up to billion 
b 
financial covenants within npc s financing agreements under its million revolving credit facility  npc must maintain a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capital  determined as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  not to exceed to based on december  financial statements  npc was in compliance with this covenant and could incur up to billion of additional indebtedness 
all other financial covenants contained in npc s financing agreements are suspended  as npc s senior secured debt is rated investment grade 
however  if npc s senior secured debt ratings fall below investment grade by either moody s or s p  npc would again be subject to the limitations under these additional covenants  and c 
financial covenants within nve s financing agreements as discussed in nve s ability to issue debt  npc is also subject to nve s cap on additional consolidated indebtedness of billion 
ability to issue general and refunding mortgage securities to the extent that npc has the ability to issue debt under the most restrictive covenants in its financing agreements and has financing authority to do so from the pucn  npc s ability to issue secured debt is still limited by the amount of bondable property or retired bonds that can be used to issue debt under npc s general and refunding mortgage indenture indenture 
the indenture creates a lien on substantially all of npc s properties in nevada 
as of december  billion of npc s general and refunding mortgage securities were outstanding 
npc had the capacity to issue million of general and refunding mortgage securities as of december  that amount is determined on the basis of of net utility property additions  the principal amount of retired general and refunding mortgage securities  and or the principal amount of first mortgage bonds retired after october property additions include plant in service and specific assets in cwip 
the amount of bond capacity listed above does not include eligible property in cwip 
npc also has the ability to release property from the lien of the mortgage indenture on the basis of net property additions  cash and or retired bonds 
to the extent npc releases property from the lien of npc s indenture  it will reduce the amount of securities issuable under the indenture 
credit ratings the liquidity of npc  the cost and availability of borrowing by npc under its credit facility  the potential exposure of npc to collateral calls under various contracts and the ability of npc to acquire fuel and purchased power on favorable terms are all directly affected by the credit ratings for npc s debt 
npc s senior secured debt is rated investment grade by three nrsro s fitch  moody s and s p 
in may  fitch upgraded the ratings for npc s senior secured debt to bbb from bbb and the senior unsecured debt to bb from bb  and revised the rating outlook from positive to stable 
as of december   the ratings are as follows rating agency fitch moody s s p npc sr 
secured debt bbb baa bbb npc sr 
unsecured debt bb not rated bb investment grade fitch s  moody s and s p s rating outlook for npc is stable 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
security ratings are subject to revision and withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
each security rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings  and accordingly  each rating should be evaluated in the context of the applicable methodology  independently of all other ratings 
the rating agencies provide ratings at the request of the company being rated and charge the company fees for their services 
energy supplier matters with respect to npc s contracts for purchased power  npc purchases and sells electricity with counterparties under the wspp agreement  an industry standard contract that npc uses as a member of the wspp 
the wspp contract is posted on the wspp website 
under these contracts  a material adverse change  which includes a credit rating downgrade  in npc may allow the counterparty to request adequate financial assurance  which  if not provided within three business days  could cause a default 
most contracts and confirmations for purchased power have been modified or separate agreements have been made to either shorten the normal payment due date or require payment in advance of delivery in response to requests for financial assurance 
a default must be declared within days of the event giving rise to the default becoming known 
a default will result in a termination payment equal to the present value of the net gains and losses for the entire remaining term of all contracts between the parties aggregated to a single liquidated amount due within three business d ays following the date the notice of termination is received 
the mark to market value  which is substantially based on quoted market prices  can be used to roughly approximate the termination payment and benefit at any point in time 
the net mark to market value as of december  for all suppliers continuing to provide power under a wspp agreement would approximate a million payment or obligation to npc 
these contracts qualify for the normal purchases scope exception as defined by the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasc  and as such  are not required to be marked to market on the balance sheet 
refer to note  derivatives and hedging activities  of the notes to financial statements  for further discussion 
gas supplier matters with respect to the purchase and sale of natural gas  npc uses several types of standard industry contracts 
the natural gas contract terms and conditions are more varied than the electric contracts 
consequently  some of the contracts contain language similar to that found in the wspp agreement and other agreements have unique provisions dealing with material adverse changes  which primarily means a credit rating downgrade below investment grade 
most contracts and confirmations for natural gas purchases have been modified or separate agreements have been made to either shorten the normal payment due date or require payment in advance of delivery in response to requests for financial assurances 
forward physical gas supplies are purchased under index based pricing terms and as such do not carry forward ma rk to market exposure 
gas transmission service is secured under ferc tariffs or custom agreements 
these service contracts and tariffs require the user to establish and maintain creditworthiness to obtain service or otherwise post cash or a letter of credit to be able to receive service 
service contracts are subject to ferc approved tariffs  which  under certain circumstances  require the utilities to provide collateral to continue receiving service 
npc has one transmission counterparty for which it is required to post cash collateral or a letter of credit in the event of credit rating downgrades 
as of december   the maximum amount of additional collateral npc would be required to post under these contracts in the event of credit rating downgrades was approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million would be required if npc s senior unsecured ratings are downgraded from their current level and an additional amount of approximately million would be required if npc s senior secured ratings are downgraded to below investment grade 
financial gas hedges npc enters into certain hedging contracts with various counterparties to manage the gas price risk inherent in purchased power and fuel contracts 
as discussed under npc s financing transactions  the availability under npc s revolving credit facility is reduced by the amount of net negative mark to market positions on hedging contracts with counterparties who are lenders to the revolving credit facility  provided that the reduction in availability under the revolving credit facility shall at no time exceed of the total commitments then in effect under the revolving credit facility 
the calculation of npc s negative mark to market exposure as of november  was approximately million  which amount was in effect for borrowings during the month of december currently  npc only has hedging contracts with counterparties who are also lenders on the revolving credit facility  however  future contracts entered into with non lenders may require npc to post cash collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade 
finally  in october  npc suspended its hedging program  as such  expects its exposure to negative mark to market positions to decline 
cross default provisions none of the financing agreements of npc contains a cross default provision that would result in an event of default by npc upon an event of default by nve or sppc under any of its financing agreements 
in addition  certain financing agreements of npc provide for an event of default if there is a failure under other financing agreements of npc to meet payment terms or to observe other covenants that would result in an acceleration of payments due 
most of these default provisions other than ones relating to a failure to pay such other indebtedness when due provide for a cure period of days from the occurrence of a specified event during which time npc may rectify or correct the situation before it becomes an event of default 
sierra pacific power company results of operations sppc recognized net income of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million in and a net income of million in in  sppc paid dividends to nve of approximately million and at december  had a dividend payable of million  which was subsequently paid in january in february  sppc declared a dividend of approximately million to nve 
details of sppc s operating results are further discussed below 
gross margin is presented by sppc in order to provide information that management believes aids the reader in determining how profitable the electric business is at the most fundamental level 
gross margin  which is a non gaap financial measure as defined in accordance with sec rules  provides a measure of income available to support the other operating expenses of the business and is a key factor utilized by management in its analysis of its business 
sppc believes presenting gross margin allows the reader to assess the impact of sppc s regulatory treatment and its overall regulatory environment on a consistent basis 
gross margin  as a percentage of revenue  is primarily impacted by the fluctuations in regulated electric and natural gas supply costs versus the fixed rates collected from customers 
while these fluctuating costs impact gross margin as a percentage of revenue  they only impact gross margin amounts if the costs cannot be passed through to customers 
gross margin  which sppc calculates as operating revenues less energy costs  provides a measure of income available to support the other operating expenses of sppc 
for reconciliation to operating income  see note  segment information  in the notes to financial statements 
gross margin changes are based primarily on general base rate adjustments which are required to be filed by statute every three years 
the components of gross margin for the years ended december dollars in thousands change from change from amount prior year amount prior year amount operating revenues electric gas energy costs fuel for power generation purchased power gas purchased for resale deferred energy electric net deferred energy gas net energy costs by segment electric gas gross margin by segment electric gas electric gross margin decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in primarily due to a decrease in customer usage as a result of milder summer weather  conservation programs and economic conditions 
in addition  gross margin decreased as a result of revenue associated with the repr 
repr is a rate mechanism designed to provide rebates to customers for the implementation of approved renewable projects 
beginning in  these amounts are reported net of their related operating expense  as such  repr amounts do not affect gross margin 
in and  repr charges were not material and were included in revenues  which therefore increased gr oss margin  but did not effect operating income or net income 
partially offsetting the decrease in gross margin was an adjustment for california revenues upon a final filing in with the cpuc in regards to the rate reduction certificates series electric gross margin increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to an increase in btgr revenue as a result of sppc s grc  effective july   and a slight increase in average customer growth 
partially offsetting the increase was a change in customer usage patterns which may be attributable to economic conditions  conservation programs  a decrease in short term transmission revenue  and the switching of certain mining customers to dos 
gas gross margin decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in primarily due to decreased customer usage as a result of warmer weather

these decreases were partially offset by increased industrial usage primarily from a gold mining customer who resumed full operation in october the average number of residential and commercial customers increased and  respectively  while industrial customers decreased 
sppc s retail revenues decreased in compared to primarily due to lower industrial revenue and decreased customer usage due to milder weather during the first three quarters of industrial revenues decreased primarily due to the transition of cortez mine to distribution only service effective november  and a retail service agreement with newmont beginning in june in addition  one large commercial customer moved to standby service effective november  lower rates as a result of the bter quarterly update and the annual deferred energy cases effective october  also contributed to the decrease 
these decreases were partially offset by increased retail rates as a result of sppc s btgr case effective july  see note  regulatory actions of the notes to financial statements 
the average number of residential customers decreased and the average number of commercial and industrial customers increased and  respectively 
in  sppc and newmont entered into a wholesale power sale agreement and a new form of retail service  whereby newmont will sell the electrical output from its generating plant to sppc for at least years under a long term wholesale purchase power agreement and remain a retail customer of sppc during at least that period under the terms of the retail service agreement and pursuant to a new rate schedule 
the terms of these contracts became effective on june   at which point newmont moved to a new retail service agreement at a reduced energy rate  which resulted in decreased electric revenues 
electric operating revenues other increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily due to an adjustment for california revenues upon a final filing in with the cpuc in regards to the rate reduction certificates series electric operating revenues other decreased in compared to primarily due to decreased sales of wholesale power to other utilities and decreased transmission revenues due to the termination of several transmission service agreements 
gas operating revenues amount change from prior year amount change from prior year amount gas operating revenues residential commercial industrial retail revenues wholesale miscellaneous total revenues retail sales in thousands of dths average retail revenues per dth sppc s retail gas revenues decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  primarily due to decreased retail rates and decreased customer usage

retail gas revenues decreased slightly in as compared to retail rates decreased as a result of sppc s bter updates during the first and fourth quarters of and the natural gas and propane deferred rate case effective october  these decreases were offset by increases resulting from sppc s bter updates during the second and third quarters 
see note  regulatory actions of the notes to financial statements 
customer usage decreased during the first and second quarter of due to warmer weather and increased during the fourth quarter due to much colder temperatures 
the average number of retail customers increased by 
wholesale revenues increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in primarily due to sales related to the optimization of pipeline capacity and excess availability of gas for wholesale sales 
wholesale revenues decreased in compared to primarily due to decreased availability of gas for wholesale sales during the fourth quarter of energy costs energy costs include fuel for generation and purchased power 
these costs are dependent upon many factors which may vary by season or period 
as a result  sppc s usage and average cost per mwh of fuel for generation versus purchased power can vary significantly as the company meets the demands of the season

the decrease in total system demand for the year ended december  compared to the same period in is primarily due to a decrease in customer usage which may be attributable to economic conditions  conservation programs and milder winter temperatures in fuel for generation decreased primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with hedging activities and a decrease in generation  partially offset by an increase in natural gas costs 
mwhs generated decreased primarily due to internal generation outages 
the average fuel cost per mwh of generated power was less primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with hedging activities 
purchased power costs and the average cost per mwh increased primarily due to an increase in volume as a result of internal generation outages 
energy costs decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in due to lower natural gas prices  reduced capacity  tolling and transmission costs  which were partially offset by costs associated with hedging activities 
total mwhs decreased due to cooler summer temperatures  certain customers switching to dos and a change in customer usage patterns 
fuel for generation increased primarily due to an increase in self generation as a result of the expansion at the tracy generating station which was placed in service july the average cost per mwh for fuel for generation decreased in primarily due to lower market prices for natural gas partially offset by increased costs for hedging transactions 
purchase power costs and the average cost per mwh of purchased power decreased primarily due to a decrease in volume 
as a result of the decrease in volume sppc was able to fulfill a significant amount of its purchased power requirements through the purchase power contract with newmont  as discussed above under electric operating revenues 
furthermore  sppc was able to significantly reduce capacity  tolling and transmission costs 
gas purchased for resale amount change from prior year amount change from prior year amount gas purchased for resale gas purchased for resale in thousands of dth average cost per dth gas purchased for resale and average cost per dth decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the decrease is primarily due to decreased hedging costs 
the volume of gas purchased for resale increased in compared to primarily due to sales related to the optimization of pipeline capacity and excess availability of gas for wholesale sales 
gas purchased for resale and average cost per dth decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in natural gas prices partially offset by an increase in hedging cost 
the volume of gas purchased for resale increased in compared to primarily due to slightly colder weather in deferred energy amount change from prior year amount change from prior year amount deferred energy electric deferred energy gas total deferred energy represents the difference between actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred during the period and amounts recoverable through current rates 
to the extent actual costs exceed amounts recoverable through current rates  the excess is recognized as a reduction in costs 
conversely to the extent actual costs are less than amounts recoverable through current rates the difference is recognized as an increase in costs

other expense decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in due to lower advertising costs in and adjustments resulting from sppc s grc effective in partially offsetting the decrease was a disallowance relating to contract pricing for energy 
analysis of cash flows sppc s cash flows increased during compared to due to a reduction in cash used by investing activities offset by a decrease in cash from operating activities and a decrease in cash from financing activities 
cash from operating activities 
the decrease in cash from operating activities is primarily due to a reduction in bter and deaa rates charged to customers  and an increase in spending on energy conservation programs 
the decrease in cash was partially offset by decreased spending on fuel for purchased power costs and a decrease in funding for pension plans compared to cash used by investing activities 
cash used by investing activities decreased mainly due to the slowdown in construction for infrastructure  and proceeds from the sale of property 
cash from financing activities 
cash from financing activities decreased primarily due to the redemption of sppc s general and refunding mortgage notes  series h due in an aggregate principal amount of million and a decrease in capital contributions from nve 
this decrease was partially offset by lower dividend payments to nve 
liquidity and capital resources overall liquidity sppc s primary source of operating cash flows is electric revenues  including the recovery of previously deferred energy costs 
significant uses of cash flows from operations include the purchase of electricity and natural gas  other operating expenses  capital expenditures and the payment of interest on sppc s outstanding indebtedness 
operating cash flows can be significantly influenced by factors such as weather  regulatory outcome and economic conditions 
available liquidity as of december  was as follows in millions available liquidity as of december  sppc cash and cash equivalents balance available on revolving credit facility less reduction for hedging transactions as of february   sppc had approximately million available under its revolving credit facility which includes reductions for hedging transactions and letters of credits  as discussed below under financing transactions 
reduction for hedging transactions reflects balance as of november  sppc attempts to maintain its cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid investments  such as us treasury bills and bank deposits 
in addition to cash on hand  sppc may use its revolving credit facility in order to meet its liquidity needs 
alternatively  depending on the usage of the revolving credit facility  sppc may issue debt  subject to certain restrictions as discussed in factors affecting liquidity  ability to issue debt  below 
sppc has no significant debt maturities in either or as of february   sppc has no borrowings on its revolving credit facility  not including letters of credit 
sppc anticipates that it will be able to meet short term operating costs  such as fuel and purchased power costs  with internally generated funds  including the recovery of deferred energy and the use of its revolving credit facility 
furthermore  in order to fund long term capital requirements and maturing debt obligations  sppc will use a combination of internally generated funds  its revolving credit facility  the issuance of long term debt and or capital contributions from nve 
however  if energy costs rise at a rapid rate and sppc does not recover the cost of fuel and purchased power in a timely manner  if operating costs are not recovered in a timely manner or sppc were to experience a credit rating downgrade resulting in the posting of collateral as discussed below under gas supplier matters and financial gas hedges  the amount of liquidity available to sppc could be significantly less 
in order to maintain sufficient liquidity  sppc may be required to further delay capital expenditures  refinance debt or obtain funding through an equity issuance by nve 
the ability to issue debt  as discussed later  is subject to certain covenant calculations which include consolidated net income of nve and the utilities 
as a result of these covenant calculations and the seasonality of the utilities business  the ability to issue debt can vary from quarter to quarter  and the utilities may not be able to fully utilize the availability on their revolving credit facilities 
in  sppc s credit ratings on its senior secured debt remained at investment grade see credit ratings below 
in  sppc did not experience any limitations in the credit markets  nor do we expect any significant limitations in however  disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to sppc may affect its ability to access funding sources or cause an increase in the interest rates paid on newly issued debt 
in  sppc paid dividends to nve of million and at december  had million in dividends payable which was subsequently paid in january sppc designs operating and capital budgets to control operating costs and capital expenditures 
in addition to operating expenses  sppc has continuing commitments for capital expenditures for construction  improvement and maintenance of facilities 
detailed below are sppc s capital structure  capital requirements  recently completed financing transactions and factors affecting liquidity  including our ability to obtain debt on favorable terms 
capital structure sppc s actual consolidated capital structure was as follows at december dollars in thousands amount percent of total capitalization amount percent of total capitalization current maturities of long term debt long term debt shareholder s equity total capital requirements construction expenditures sppc s cash requirement for construction expenditures for is projected to be million 
sppc s cash requirement for construction expenditures for through is projected to be million 
cash used by investing activities for the years ended  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
to fund future capital projects sppc may meet such financial obligations with a combination of internally generated funds  the use of its revolving credit facility and if necessary  the issuance of long term debt and or capital contributions from nve 
contractual obligations the table below provides sppc s consolidated contractual obligations  as of december   that sppc expects to satisfy through a combination of internally generated cash and  as necessary  through the issuance of short term and long term debt 
certain contracts contain variable factors which required sppc to estimate the obligation depending on the final variable amount 
actual amounts could differ 
the table does not include estimated construction expenditures described above  except for major capital projects for which sppc has executed contracts by december  additionally  at december   sppc recorded an uncertain tax liability of million as required by the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes topi c of the fasc  all of which is classified as non current 
sppc is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash payments to relevant tax authorities  consequently  none of the uncertain tax liability is included in the contractual obligations table below dollars in thousands payment due by period thereafter total long term debt maturities long term debt interest payments purchased power coal and natural gas transportation long term service agreements capital projects operating leases total contractual cash obligations includes the tua with gbt which is contingent upon final construction costs and reaching commercial operation  which is expected in late amounts based on estimated usage 
capital projects include nv energize 
additionally  sppc  as a joint owner  has obligations regarding the construction of on line 
pension and other postretirement benefit plan matters nve has a qualified pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan which cover substantially all employees of nve  npc and sppc 
the annual net benefit cost for the plans is expected to decrease in by approximately million compared to the cost of million 
as of december   the measurement date  the plan was under funded under the provisions of the compensation retirement benefits topic of the fasc 
refer to note  retirement plan and post retirement benefits  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during  nve funded a total of million to the trusts established for these plans 
at the present time it is not expected that additional funding will be required in to meet the minimum funding level requirements defined by the pension protection act of however  nve and the utilities have included in their assumptions funding levels similar to the funding 
the amounts to be contributed in may change subject to market conditions 
financing transactions redemption of general and refunding mortgage notes  series h in december  sppc redeemed all of its general refunding mortgage notes  series h  due  in an aggregate principal amount of million 
the notes were redeemed in december at a purchase price of  for each  principal amount of the notes  plus accrued interest 
the redemption was predominantly funded with available cash on hand  and the remainder funded with a draw on sppc s revolving credit facility 
million revolving credit facility in april  sppc terminated its million secured revolving credit facility which would have expired in november and replaced it with a million secured revolving credit facility  maturing in april the fees on the million revolving credit facility for the unused portion and on the amounts borrowed have increased from the prior facility reflecting current market conditions 
the administrative agent for the facility is bank of america  na the rate for outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility will be at either an applicable base rate defined as the highest of the prime rate  the federal funds rate plus of and the libor base rate plus plus a margin  or a libor rate plus a margin 
the margin varies based upon npc s credit rating by s p and moody s 
currently  sppc s applicable base rate margin is and the libor rate margin is 
the rate for outstanding letters of credit will be at the libor rate margin plus a fee for the issuing bank 
the million revolving credit facility contains a provision which reduces the availability under the credit facility by the negative mark to market exposure for hedging transactions with credit facility lenders or their energy trading affiliates 
the reduction in availability limits the amount that sppc can borrow or use for letters of credit and would require that sppc prepay any amount in excess of that limitation 
the amount of the reduction is calculated by sppc on a monthly basis  and after calculating such reduction  the sppc credit agreement provides that the reduction in availability under the revolving credit facility to sppc shall not exceed of the total commitments then in effect under the revolving credit facility 
the sppc credit agreement contains one financial maintenance covenant that requires sppc to maintain a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capital  determined as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  not to exceed to in the event that sppc did not meet the financial maintenance covenant or there is an event of default  the sppc credit agreement would restrict dividends to nve 
moreover  so long as sppc s senior secured debt remains rated investment grade by s p and moody s in each case  with a stable or better outlook  a representation concerning no material adverse change in sppc s business  assets  property or financial condition would not be a condition to the availability of credit under the facility 
in the event that sppc s senior secured deb t rating were rated below investment grade by either s p or moody s  or investment grade by either s p or moody s but with a negative outlook  a representation concerning no material adverse change in sppc s business  assets  property or financial condition would be a condition to borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
factors affecting liquidity ability to issue debt sppc s ability to issue debt is impacted by certain factors such as financing authority from the pucn  financial covenants in its financing agreements and its revolving credit facility agreement  and the terms of certain nve debt 
as of december   the most restrictive of the factors below is the pucn authority 
based on this restriction  sppc may issue up to million of long term debt securities  and maintain a credit facility of up to million 
however  depending on nve s or npc s issuance of long term debt or the use of the utilities revolving credit facilities  the pucn authority may not remain the most restrictive factor 
the factors affecting sppc s ability to issue debt are further detailed below a 
financing authority from the pucn as of december   sppc has financing authority from the pucn for the period ending december   consisting of authority to issue additional long term debt securities of up to million  to refinance approximately million of long term debt securities  and ongoing authority to maintain a revolving credit facility of up to million  b 
financial covenants within sppc s financing agreements under sppc s million revolving credit facility  the utility must maintain a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capital  determined as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  not to exceed to based on december  financial statements  sppc was in compliance with this covenant and could incur up to million of additional indebtedness 
all other financial covenants contained in sppc s financing agreements are suspended  as sppc s senior secured debt is rated investment grade 
however  if sppc s senior secured debt ratings fall below investment grade by either moody s or s p  sppc would again be subject to the limitations under these additional covenants  and c 
financial covenants within nve s financing agreements as discussed in nve s ability to issue debt  sppc is also subject to nve s cap on additional consolidated indebtedness of billion 
ability to issue general and refunding mortgage securities to the extent that sppc has the ability to issue debt under the most restrictive covenants in its financing agreements and has financing authority to do so from the pucn  sppc s ability to issue secured debt is still limited by the amount of bondable property or retired bonds that can be used to issue debt under sppc s general and refunding mortgage indenture indenture 
the indenture creates a lien on substantially all of sppc s properties in nevada and california 
as of december   billion of sppc s general and refunding mortgage securities were outstanding 
sppc had the capacity to issue million of additional general and refunding mortgage securities as of december  however  as a result of the sale of the california assets as discussed in note  assets held for sale  in the notes to the financial statements  sppc s capacity to issue general and refunding mortgage securities as of january  was reduced to million 
that amount is determined on the basis of of net utility property additions  the principal amount of retired general and refunding mortgage securities  and or the principal amount of first mortgage bonds retired after october property additions include plant in service and specific assets in cwip 
the amount of bond capacity listed above does not include eligible property in cwip 
sppc also has the ability to release property from the lien of the mortgage indenture on the basis of net property additions  cash and or retired bonds 
to the extent sppc releases property from the lien of sppc s indenture  it will reduce the amount of securities issuable under the indenture 
credit ratings the liquidity of sppc  the cost and availability of borrowing by sppc under its credit facility  the potential exposure of sppc to collateral calls under various contracts and the ability of sppc to acquire fuel and purchased power on favorable terms are all directly affected by the credit ratings for sppc s debt 
sppc s senior secured debt is rated investment grade by three nrsros fitch  moody s and s p 
in may  fitch upgraded the rating for sppc s senior secured debt to bbb from bbb and revised the rating outlook from positive to stable 
as of december   the ratings are as follows rating agency fitch moody s s p sppc sr 
secured debt bbb baa bbb investment grade fitch s  moody s and s p s rating outlook for sppc is stable 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
security ratings are subject to revision and withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
each security rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings  and  accordingly  each rating should be evaluated in the context of the applicable methodology  independently of all other ratings 
the rating agencies provide ratings at the request of the company being rated and charge the company fees for their services 
energy supplier matters with respect to sppc s contracts for purchased power  sppc purchases and sells electricity with counterparties under the wspp agreement  an industry standard contract that sppc uses as a member of the wspp 
the wspp contract is posted on the wspp website 
under these contracts  a material adverse change  which includes a credit rating downgrade  in sppc may allow the counterparty to request adequate financial assurance  which  if not provided within three business days  could cause a default 
most contracts and confirmations for purchased power have been modified or separate agreements have been made to either shorten the normal payment due date or require payment in advance of delivery in response to requests for financial assurance 
a default must be declared within days of the event  giving rise to the default becoming known 
a default will result in a termination payment equal to the present value of the net gains and losses for the entire remaining term of all contracts between the parties aggregated to a single liquidated amount due within three business days following the date the notice of termination is received 
the mark to market value  which is substantially based on quoted market prices  can be used to roughly approximate the termination payment and benefit at any point in time 
under the net mark to market value as of december  for all suppliers continuing to provide power under a wspp agreement no amounts would be due to or from sppc 
these contracts qualify for the normal purchases scope exception as defined by the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasc  and as such  are not required to be mark to market on the balance sheet 
refer to note  derivatives and hedging activities  of the notes to financial statements  for further discussion 
gas supplier matters with respect to the purchase and sale of natural gas  sppc uses several types of standard industry contracts 
the natural gas contract terms and conditions are more varied than the electric contracts 
consequently  some of the contracts contain language similar to that found in the wspp agreement and other agreements have unique provisions dealing with material adverse change  which primarily means a credit rating downgrade below investment grade 
forward physical gas supplies are purchased under index based pricing terms and as such do not carry forward mark to market exposure 
most contracts and confirmations for natural gas purchases have been modified or separate agreements have been made to either shorten the normal payment due date or require payment in advance of delivery 
at the present time  no counterparties require payment in advance of delivery 
gas transmission service is secured under ferc tariffs or custom agreements 
these service contracts and tariffs require the user to establish and maintain creditworthiness to obtain service or otherwise post cash or a letter of credit to be able to receive service 
service contracts are subject to ferc approved tariffs  which  under certain circumstances  require the utilities to provide collateral to continue receiving service 
financial gas hedges sppc enters into certain hedging contracts with various counterparties to manage the gas price risk inherent in purchased power and fuel contracts 
as discussed under sppc s financing transactions  the availability under sppc s revolving credit facility is reduced by the amount of net negative mark to market positions on hedging contracts with counterparties who are lenders to the revolving credit facility  provided that the reduction in availability under the revolving credit facility shall at no time exceed of the total commitments then in effect under the revolving credit facility 
the calculation of sppc s negative mark to market exposure as of november  was approximately million  which amount was in effect for borrowings during the month of december curren tly  sppc only has hedging contracts with counterparties who are also lenders on the revolving credit facility  however  future contracts entered into with non lenders may require sppc to post cash collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade 
finally  in october  sppc suspended its hedging program  as such  expects its exposure to negative mark to market positions to decline 
cross default provisions none of the financing agreements of sppc contains a cross default provision that would result in an event of default by sppc upon an event of default by nve or npc under any of its financing agreements 
in addition  certain financing agreements of sppc provide for an event of default if there is a failure under other financing agreements of sppc to meet payment terms or to observe other covenants that would result in an acceleration of payments due 
most of these default provisions other than ones relating to a failure to pay such other indebtedness when due provide for a cure period of days from the occurrence of a specified event during which time sppc may rectify or correct the situation before it becomes an event of default 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   nve  npc and sppc have evaluated their risk related to financial instruments whose values are subject to market sensitivity 
such instruments are fixed and variable rate debt 
the tables below do not include the interest rate swap entered into in and discussed further in note  derivatives and hedging activities  of the notes to financial statements  as the amount is considered immaterial 
fair market value is determined using quoted market price for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered for debt of the same remaining maturities as of december dollars in thousands expected maturities fair thereafter total value long term debt nve fixed rate average interest rate npc fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate sppc fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate total debt expected maturities fair thereafter total value long term debt nve fixed rate average interest rate npc fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate sppc fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate total debt commodity price risk commodity price increases due to changes in market conditions are recovered through the deferred energy mechanism 
although the utilities actively manage energy commodity electric  natural gas  coal and oil price risk through their procurement strategies  the ability to recover commodity price changes through future rates substantially mitigates commodity price risk 
however  the utilities are subject to cash flow risk due to changes in the value of their open positions and are subject to regulatory risk because the pucn may disallow recovery for any costs that it considers imprudently incurred 
the utilities mitigate both risk associated with its open positions and regulatory risk through prudent energy supply practices which include the use of long term fuel supply agreements  long term purchase po wer agreements and derivative instruments such as forwards  options and swaps to meet the anticipated fuel and power requirements 
see energy supply in item  business  for a discussion of the utilities purchased power procurement strategies 
credit risk the utilities monitor and manage credit risk with their trading counterparties 
credit risk is defined as the possibility that a counterparty to one or more contracts will be unable or unwilling to fulfill its financial or physical obligations to the utilities because of the counterparty s financial condition 
the utilities credit risk associated with trading counterparties was approximately million as of december   which compares to balances of million at december  the decrease from december  is primarily due to the decrease in prices of natural gas and power during
