item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition as of december  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
also  additional information on the company s revenues and operations can found above in business general overview and operating strategy 
we promote outdoor motorsports events 
weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets  concessions and souvenirs  among other things 
although we sell a substantial number of tickets well in advance of our larger events  poor weather conditions can have a negative effect on our results of operations 
poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods because consumer demand can be affected by the success of past events 
management believes that our financial performance has not been materially affected by inflation 
results of operations our revenues and expenses are classified in the following categories because they are important to  and used by  management in assessing operations admissions  event related revenue  nascar broadcasting revenue  and other operating revenue 
admissions includes ticket sales for all of our events 
event related revenue includes amounts received from sponsorship and naming rights fees  luxury suite rentals  event souvenir merchandise sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  promotional and hospitality revenues  track rentals  driving school and karting revenues  broadcasting rights other than nascar broadcasting revenue  and other event and speedway related revenues 
nascar broadcasting revenue includes rights fees obtained for domestic television broadcasts of nascar sanctioned events held at the company s speedways 
other operating revenue includes certain merchandising revenues of smi properties and tsi  car and part sales of us legend cars  restaurant  catering and membership income from the speedway clubs at cms and tms  revenues of oil chem  which produces an environmentally friendly micro lubricant  and industrial park and office rentals 
earnings or losses on equity investees includes our share of ma merchandising joint venture equity investee profits or losses 
our revenue items produce different operating margins 
broadcast rights  sponsorships  ticket sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  and luxury suite and track rentals produce higher margins than non event merchandise sales  as well as sales of us legend cars  oil chem  smi properties  tsi or other operating revenues 
we classify our expenses to include direct expense of events  nascar purse and sanction fees  and other direct operating expense  among other categories 
direct expense of events principally includes cost of souvenir sales  non nascar race purses and sanctioning fees  property and event insurance  compensation of certain employees  advertising  sales and admission taxes  cost of driving school and karting revenues  event settlement payments to non nascar sanctioning bodies and outside event support services 
nascar purse and sanction fees includes payments to  and portions of broadcasting revenues retained by  nascar for associated events held at our speedways 
other direct operating expense includes the cost of certain smi properties and tsi merchandising  us legend cars  speedway clubs  oil chem and industrial park and office tower rental revenues 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for operating and other financial information on our reporting segments 
racing events we derive a substantial portion of our total revenues from admissions  event related and nascar broadcasting revenue

management believes these revenues were negatively impacted by declines in consumer and corporate spending from the recession  difficult credit and housing markets  and other economic factors as further described below 
for our upcoming events  similar to  management has reduced many ticket prices  and continues to offer extended payment terms to many ticket buyers although generally not beyond when events are held to help foster fan support and mitigate any near term demand weakness 
admission revenues have declined recently from both fewer fans attending our race events and from lower average ticket prices 
lower ticket prices in constituted approximately of the total decline in admission revenues for nascar sanctioned sprint cup and nationwide series racing events as compared to also  we have increased advertising and other promotional activities to help offset the ongoing impact of these adverse economic and market conditions 
smi s seasonal and event based business model results in relatively long revenue cycles because many tickets and event related revenues are sold well in advance 
as such  it may take relatively longer for smi s results to again reflect sales growth as economic conditions improve 
while lower ticket prices and extended payment terms can affect operating margins and lengthen cash flow cycles as compared to historical levels  management believes these are prudent measures in the current operating environment 
most of our nascar sprint cup and nationwide series event sponsorships  and many for years beyond  are already sold 
along with realigning an annual nascar sprint cup race date from ams to kys as further discussed below  the annual sprint cup race date scheduled for ir is one week later in the second quarter than in  and for nhms is two weeks later  moving to the third quarter from the second quarter the company believes hosting the ir and nhms racing events at these later dates should help increase ticket demand due to being further into the summer vacation season and the prospects for better weather 
the televised network and cable ratings for the nascar sprint cup increased and decreased  respectively  compared to the prior year  however  several racing events were delayed or rescheduled due to poor weather  which we believe adversely affected television ratings 
the television ratings for nascar sprint cup races are showing year to date increases 
the sprint cup series continues as the second highest rated regular season televised sport behind only the national football league  and was the first or second highest televised sport out of event weekends in also  the nascar nationwide series was the second  and the nascar camping world truck series was the third  highest rated motorsports series on television 
as described below  much of our future revenues are already contracted under television broadcasting rights and other long term contracts 
in and future seasons  as well as in past years  nascar has made  and will likely continue making  refinements to racing rules  championship points formats  technical changes and other adjustments as a sanctioning body to enhance on track racing competition and excitement and generate additional fan interest 
such refinements include  among others  double file restarts  changing from rear wings to spoilers on certain car of tomorrow models  earlier and consistent race start times  new qualifying procedures  multiple attempts at finishing races under the green flag and relaxing on track rules and regulations 
in  nascar introduced the car of tomorrow at bristol motor speedway  which was designed by nascar over several years with the following primary objectives driver safety  improved performance and competition  and more efficient cost management for teams 
also  nascar continues to refine the sprint cup series championship points format which determines competitors eligibility for the chase for the championship 
for example  nascar simplified this points system and introduced wild card eligi speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents bility in  attempting to place greater emphasis on winning races 
nascar also changed the rules of participation so that race drivers can now compete for championship points in only one of nascar s sprint cup  nationwide or camping world series 
these changes give additional points and benefits for winning races and are intended to make racing more competitive during the entire season 
also  female drivers such as danica patrick in the nationwide race series  represent one of the many sizeable and largely untapped demographics in nascar racing 
we believe these  as well as other ongoing industry developments  are favorable  long term industry changes that provide us with many new marketing and future growth opportunities 
many economic factors have dampened  and may continue to dampen  consumer and corporate spending  including adversely impacting recreational and entertainment spending  resulting in a negative impact on our motorsports and non motorsports activities 
as reflected in our earnings guidance below  reduced consumer and corporate spending has  and we believe will continue to  negatively impact admissions  sponsorship  advertising and hospitality spending  concession and souvenir sales demand  luxury suite and other track rentals  with related effects on our motorsports and non motorsports activities and future revenues  profitability and cash flows 
low levels of consumer confidence  difficult residential real estate and mortgage markets  high unemployment  sizable stock market declines or volatility  tight consumer and business credit markets  among other recessionary conditions and economic factors  have dampened and may continue to dampen consumer spending 
the strength of the us economy  including the financial and credit markets  currently remains uncertain due to these factors 
high or increasing fuel prices  particularly given the elevated geopolitical tensions in the middle east and other foreign regions  could significantly impact consumer spending  economic recovery and our future results 
government responses and actions may or may not successfully restore stability to the credit and consumer markets and improve economic conditions in the foreseeable future 
record state and federal budgetary deficits could result in government responses such as higher consumer and corporate income or other tax rates 
governmental spending deficits could lead to higher interest rates and continued difficult borrowing conditions for consumers and corporate customers 
whether or when these severe conditions might improve cannot be determined at this time 
each of these negative factors  and particularly when combined  have and may further adversely impact various industries of our present and potential consumer and corporate customers  resulting in continued or further spending declines that could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
as further described in item a risk factors  a lack of competitiveness in sprint cup series races  the closeness of the championship points race  race car driver popularity  and the success of nascar racing in general  in any particular racing season  can also significantly impact our operating results 
these and similar factors can affect attendance at nascar sprint cup and nationwide racing events  as well as corporate marketing interest  that can significantly impact our operating results 
all of the aforementioned factors  among others  can have a material adverse impact on our future operating results  cash flows and growth 
however  management believes our strong operating cash flow will continue  and that ticket demand and corporate marketing and promotional spending will increase as the economy improves 
our long term  multi year contracted revenues are significant much of our total revenue is generated under long term contracts 
for example  the term of the eight year nascar television broadcast agreement is through  and many of our sponsorships and other corporate marketing contracts are for multiple years 
also  we have contracted revenues under several long term operating leases for various office  warehouse and industrial park space to various entities largely involved in motorsports 
we believe the substantial amount of total revenue generated under such long term contracts helps stabilize our financial resilience and profitability  particularly during difficult economic conditions 
we believe the attractive demographics surrounding motorsports and our premier markets  where we own first class facilities  continue to provide substantial opportunities for increasing our number of longer term sponsorship partners and commitments 
our naming rights agreement that renamed charlotte motor speedway as lowe s motor speedway expired after  and was not renewed 
our naming rights agreement that renamed sears point raceway as infineon raceway expires in early the expiring agreements provided significant contracted revenues over the ten year life of the agreements 
however  the annual contracted revenue received by us under each agreement was not material 
there can be no assurance we will execute any replacement agreements on acceptable terms 
future costs incurred for renaming the speedway facility  and replacing promotional signage  materials and merchandise  are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
earnings guidance in connection with our fourth quarter and full year earnings release  management provided full year guidance of per diluted share from continuing operations 
this guidance excludes a non recurring charge speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents related to debt refinancing anticipated in the first quarter as further described below in future liquidity 
the wide range of earnings guidance reflects the continuing negative impact of uncertain economic conditions  as well as the timing and pace of economic recovery 
high or increasing fuel prices  particularly given the elevated geopolitical tensions in the middle east and other foreign regions  could significantly impact our future results 
year over year comparisons of operating results in addition to the comparative information below  certain non gaap financial information is set forth in item selected financial data which management believes  among other things  helps in understanding and comparing our results of operations 
also  due to the economic and other factors described above in near term operating factors  management believes admissions  many event related revenue categories  and other operating revenues reflected below continue to be negatively impacted by declines in consumer and corporate spending due to the weak economic conditions and difficult consumer credit and housing markets 
poor weather can negatively affect current events  particularly attendance  as well as successive events in future periods because past fan and other customer event experience can impact future demand 
in  similar to  management reduced many ticket prices to help foster fan support and mitigate any near term demand weakness 
admission revenues have declined recently from both fewer fans attending our race events and from lower average ticket prices 
while lower ticket prices can affect operating margins as compared to historical levels  management believes these are prudent measures in the current operating environment

the decrease also reflects cost reduction efforts for outside event support services  facilities maintenance  and equipment rentals  among other event expenses

seasonality and quarterly results our business has been  and is expected to remain  somewhat seasonal 
concentration of racing events in any particular future quarter  and the growth in our operations  including speedway acquisitions  with attendant increases in overhead expenses  may tend to minimize operating income in respective future quarters 
one annual nascar sprint cup race is being realigned from a first quarter event at ams to a third quarter event at kys beginning in this realignment is expected to impact future operating income positively in the third quarter and negatively in the first quarter 
racing schedules may change from time to time  which can lessen the comparability of operating results between quarters of successive years and increase or decrease the seasonal nature of our motorsports business

in march  we plan to redeem all remaining outstanding senior subordinated notes in aggregate principal amount of million at of par with credit facility borrowings and cash on hand 
cash on hand was also used to fund the tender offer redemption premium  accrued interest  and settlement and transaction costs for all associated debt transactions 
cash on hand used in these financing transactions is aggregating approximately million 
the tender offer redemption premium  associated unamortized net deferred loan costs  settlement payment and transaction costs  all associated with the former debt arrangements  and aggregating approximately million  before income taxes of million  will likely be reflected as a charge to earnings in the first quarter our management and board of directors believes the notes offering  combined with the credit facility amendment and restatement  will provide us with reduced future interest costs  longer maturity  and a better combination of variable and fixed rate debt 
the amended credit facility contains lower adjustable interest rate tiers and less restrictive financial ratio covenants 
we retired fixed interest rate senior subordinated notes with a combination of variable interest rate credit facility borrowings and new fixed interest rate senior note proceeds 
at this time  interest rates for our credit facility borrowings  including the term loan  are lower than the retired debt 
although these financing transactions did not substantially change our overall outstanding debt levels  the structured repayment of the million term loan borrowings over four years is expected to reduce our indebtedness levels  leverage and future interest costs earlier than under our previous debt structure 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of december  management believes the most restrictive financial covenant in our debt agreements  after the financing transactions  is the amended credit facility requirement for maintaining minimum financial ratios of earnings before interest and taxes ebit to interest expense  as defined 
the minimum required ratio is no less than to on march   increasing to no less than to on december  management actively monitors compliance with this and all other financial covenants 
if future operating results or events result in such ratios below the required minimum  management is prepared to take certain actions to remain compliant 
such actions could include  for example  loan repayments or refinancing  reducing capital expenditures or operating expenses where practical  speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents or obtaining loan compliance waivers 
however  we can provide no assurance that further deteriorations in our profitability or cash flows  or other unforeseen negative operating factors or conditions  would not result in non compliance with this or any other debt covenant 
any such non compliance could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition  operating results or cash flows  and our ability to maintain compliance can be affected by events beyond our control 
as further described in item a risk factors  possible material adverse effects from non compliance could include  among others  cross default under any or all of our debt agreements and acceleration of all amounts outstanding 
amendment of bank credit facility we have a long term  senior secured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by bank of america  na as administrative agent and lender 
borrowings under the credit facility can be used to refinance existing company indebtedness  and for working capital  capital expenditures  permitted investments  acquiring additional motor speedways and related businesses  and other corporate purposes  subject to specified limitations 
our credit facility as amended and restated in january among other things i provides a four year million senior secured revolving credit facility  including separate sub limits of million for letters of credit and million for swing line loans  ii provides a four year million senior secured term loan  iii matures in january  iv allows us to increase revolving commitments or establish a term loan or a combination of the two up to an aggregate additional million with certain lender commitment conditions  v allows the acquisition of additional motor speedways and related businesses subject to specified limitations  vi permits other investments not specifically referenced of up to million each year with unrestricted subsidiaries  vii allows annual aggregate payments of dividends and repurchases of smi securities of up to million  increasing up to million subject to maintaining certain financial covenants  and viii limits annual capital expenditures to million 
the amended credit facility also contains a commitment fee ranging from to of unused amounts available for borrowing 
the interest rate margins on borrowings and the commitment fee are adjustable periodically based upon certain consolidated total leverage ratios 
after the credit facility amendment and senior subordinated notes redemption  we had availability for borrowing up to an additional million  including up to an additional million in letters of credit 
the credit facility contains a number of affirmative and negative financial covenants  including requirements that the company maintain certain ratios of funded debt to ebitda  earnings before interest and taxes ebit to interest expense  and minimum net worth

issuance of senior notes in february  we completed a private placement of new senior notes in aggregate principal amount of million 
these senior notes were issued at par value and net proceeds  after commissions and fees  approximated million 
those proceeds  along with new term loan borrowings of million under the credit facility and cash on hand  were used to redeem tendered outstanding senior subordinated notes as discussed above

nascar sprint cup race date realignment to kentucky speedway as further described below in capital expenditures and item a risk factors  we plan to continue making significant renovations  improvements and other capital expenditures for our speedway facilities  particularly at kys 
the purchases of nhms and kys significantly increased our outstanding indebtedness and leverage 
we are realigning an annual nascar sprint cup racing event from ams to kys beginning in  and are presently renovating  modernizing and significantly increasing permanent seating  and overall facilities  at kys 
the expansion and improvements will involve material capital expenditures in and over several years in amounts not yet finalized  but could range up to million or more 
the profitability or success of these and other future capital projects are subject to numerous factors  conditions and assumptions  some of which are beyond our control  and if significantly negative or unfavorable  could result in asset impairments 
future capital spending in excess of current plans could significantly increase our future depreciation expense and outstanding indebtedness and leverage 
also  future results from realigning the nascar sprint cup racing event from ams to kys could significantly differ from management estimates  including unfavorably impacting the future success of our other racing events 
each of these factors  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could materially adversely affect our future financial condition or results of operations 
realignment of the sprint cup date from ams in march to kys in july is expected to result in certain later cash flow cycles each year as many tickets and event related revenues are sold well in advance and certain nascar broadcasting revenue payments are received after events are held 
general economic conditions as further discussed in general factors and current operating trends and earnings guidance above  various economic  industry and geopolitical factors have dampened  and could continue to dampen  consumer and corporate spending 
we believe this reduced spending will continue to negatively impact admissions and event related revenues  with related effects on our motorsports and non motorsports activities and future revenues  profitability and cash flows 
our operating results have benefited from relatively lower interest rates under the credit facility 
future economic conditions and financial markets could result in continuing increases in interest rates and other borrowing costs 
at present outstanding debt levels  with increased exposure to variable interest rate fluctuations  higher interest rates would negatively impact our future profitability and cash flows 
these factors  as well as others  could make compliance with restrictive financial covenants more difficult

eight year nascar broadcasting and multi year ancillary rights agreements broadcasting revenues continue to be a significant long term revenue source for our core business 
a substantial portion of our profits in recent years has resulted from television revenues received from nascar contracts with various television networks 
as further described in part i  item business  we participate in the combined eight year nascar agreements with fox  abc espn  tnt and speed channel for the domestic television broadcast rights to all nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series events for through this eight year nascar broadcasting rights arrangement provides us with increases in annual contracted revenues through averaging per year 
our contracted nascar broadcasting revenues totaled approximately million for  and are expected to approximate million for in  an ancillary rights package for nascar 
com  nascar radio  international and other broadcasting  nascar images  sportsvision  fanscan  specialty pay per view telecasts  and other media content distribution was reached with us  nascar and others in the motorsports industry 
nascar has announced this industry wide total ancillary rights package is for a year period  which ends in nascar ratings can impact attendance at our events and sponsorship opportunities 
management believes these long term contracted revenue sources help stabilize our financial strength  earnings and cash flows 
future changes in race schedules would impact broadcasting revenues 
similar to many televised sports  overall seasonal averages for motorsports may increase or decrease from year to year  and television ratings for certain individual events may fluctuate from year to year for any number of reasons 
while this long term rights agreement will likely result in annual revenue increases over the contract period  associated annual increases in purse and sanction fees paid to nascar may continue 
the current eight year television broadcasting agreement with various television networks was negotiated and contracted by nascar  and we are not a party to the agreement 
our share of these television broadcast revenues are contracted  and purse and sanction fees are negotiated  with nascar on an annual basis for each nascar sanctioned racing event scheduled to be held by us in the speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents upcoming season year 
under these annual agreements  we are obligated to conduct events in the manner stipulated under the terms and conditions of the respective sanctioning agreements 
stock repurchase program our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing smi to repurchase up to an aggregate of million shares of our outstanding common stock from time to time  depending on market conditions  share price  applicable limitations under our various debt agreements  and other factors the board of directors or their designees  in their sole discretion  may consider relevant 
the purchases can be in the open market or private transactions 
the stock repurchase program is presently funded using available cash and cash equivalents 
during  we repurchased  shares of common stock for approximately million 
as of december   we could repurchase up to an additional  shares under the current authorization 
capital expenditures management believes significant growth in our revenues depends  in part  on consistent investment in facilities 
as such  we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements in our facilities 
currently  a number of significant capital projects are underway 
projects at december   we had various construction projects underway to increase and improve facilities for fan amenities and make other site improvements at our speedways 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we obtained approval to realign a nascar sprint cup racing event to kys beginning in we have begun renovating  modernizing and significantly increasing permanent seating at kys amounts and exact number of seats are being finalized 
we are also reconfiguring and expanding onsite roads  available parking  traffic patterns and entrances  and modernizing and expanding concessions  camping  restrooms and other kys facilities 
the contemplated expansion and improvements will likely involve material capital expenditures in and over several years in amounts not yet finalized  but which could range up to million or more 
in  we also plan to make expenditures for leading edge video and media technology to enhance the entertainment experience of race fans while attending events at cms and nhms  and for green initiatives at certain speedway facilities 
similar to prior years  we plan to continue modernizing and expanding concessions  luxury suites  camping and hospitality areas  restrooms and other fan amenities 
we also plan to continue improving and expanding on site roads and available parking  and reconfigure traffic patterns and entrances to ease congestion and improve traffic flow at our speedways 
at this time  aggregate payments for capital expenditures in are estimated to approximate to million  including expenditures for kys 
management plans to fund these capital expenditures with available cash and cash investments  working capital or borrowings under our credit facility as needed 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements at our facilities  including undetected soil or land  including environmental  conditions additional land acquisition costs increases in the cost of construction materials and labor unforeseen changes in design litigation  accidents or natural disasters affecting the construction site national or regional economic changes in addition  the actual cost could vary materially from estimates if assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required or the cost of financing such construction were to change 
construction is also subject to state and local permitting processes which  if changed  could materially adversely affect the ultimate cost and timing of construction 
should projects be abandoned or substantially decreased in scope due to the inability to obtain necessary permits or other unforeseen negative factors  we could be required to expense some or all previously capitalized costs which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
we continually evaluate new opportunities that will add value for our stockholders  including the acquisition and construction of new speedway facilities  the expansion and development of existing us legend cars and oil chem products and markets  and the expansion into new and complementary businesses

table of contents dividends any decision concerning the payment of quarterly or annual common stock dividends depends upon our results of operations  financial condition and capital expenditure plans  applicable limitations under our various debt agreements  and other factors the board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant 
as further described above and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  the credit facility allows aggregate payments of dividends and repurchases of smi securities of up to million each year  increasable up to million  subject to maintaining certain financial covenants 
the senior notes indenture and the senior notes indenture permit dividend payments each year of up to per share of common stock  increasable subject to meeting certain financial covenants 
the senior subordinated notes indenture  prior to redemption  permitted dividend payments each year of up to per share of common stock  increasable subject to meeting certain financial covenants 
on february   our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock aggregating approximately million payable on march  to shareholders of record as of march  this quarterly cash dividend is being paid using available cash and cash investments subject to the limitations and considerations described in the preceding paragraph 
off balance sheet arrangements as further described in liquidity and capital resources above  our credit facility provides for a separate sub limit for letters of credit of up to million 
as of december   we had aggregate outstanding letters of credit of  also  as of december   we had a contingent guarantee obligation associated with an equity investee limited to approximately million reduced to million in january by guarantor payments as scheduled  which expires in should the equity investee have insufficient future financial resources and such obligation remains due  we could be required to fund part or all of the guarantee up to the obligation amount determined at that time 
although reasonably possible that some obligation could arise in the future  the amount  if any  is not reasonably estimable at this time 
as such  management believes no obligation should be recorded at this time 
we presently do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements including off balance sheet obligations  guarantees  commitments  or other contractual cash obligations  other commercial commitments or contingent obligations that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses  including amounts that are susceptible to change 
we continually review our accounting policies and accounting estimates  and the application and effect on our financial statements and disclosures  for conformity with gaap  including relevance  accuracy  completeness and non omission of material information 
our critical accounting policies include accounting methods and estimates underlying such financial statement preparation  as well as judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies 
in applying critical accounting policies and making estimates  materially different amounts or results could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with risk factors  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and the consolidated financial statements  including the associated notes  appearing elsewhere in this report 
as indicated below  certain accounting policies that are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are not repeated in this section 
we believe the critical accounting policies  including amounts involving significant estimates  uncertainties and susceptibility to change  include the following the following critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements where indicated below revenue and expense recognition for racing events note accounting for nascar broadcasting revenue and purse and sanction fees note revenue recognition for marketing agreements note speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k

as described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  we follow applicable authoritative guidance which specifies  among other things  nonamortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires testing for possible impairment at least annually 
when events or circumstances indicate possible impairment may have occurred  we evaluate long lived assets  including tangible assets and intangible assets subject to amortization  for possible impairment based on expected future undiscounted operating cash flows attributable to such assets using applicable authoritative guidance 
when improvement projects produce a higher economic yield and require demolition of a component of a speedway facility  capitalization of demolition  construction and historical component costs are limited to the revised estimated value of the project 
nascar has announced it would consider potential track realignment of sprint cup series racing events to desirable  potentially more profitable market venues of speedway operators 
while relocation of any sprint cup event among our speedways we now or may own in the future could result in a net increase in our future operating profitability  long lived assets of a speedway from where a sprint cup racing event may move could become impaired resulting in a material impairment charge that adversely affects our future financial condition or results of operations 
various business and other factors associated with recoverability and impairment considerations are also described in item a risk factors above 
as of december   our market capitalization was below our consolidated shareholder s equity 
despite ongoing domestic and global economic challenges  management believes there has been no fundamental change in our core motorsports business 
management analyzed the difference for possible impairment as further described in note to the financial statements goodwill and other intangible assets 
based on this analysis  management believes the decline in our market capitalization below our consolidated shareholder s equity is temporary and not an indicator of impairment  and that goodwill and other intangible assets were not impaired as of december  as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the annual assessment also considered our efforts to realign one or more nascar sprint cup series racing events among our speedway facilities 
the impairment evaluation considered the recently approved realignment of a nascar sprint cup racing event from ams to kys beginning in  and included management s best estimate of future discounted operating cash flows and profitability associated with realignment of those race dates 
realignment of the race date from ams to kys resulted in no impairment of intangible or other long lived assets 
our annual impairment assessment indicated the estimated fair value of each reporting unit and each indefinite lived intangible asset exceeded its associated carrying value 
as such  no goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges were found necessary at this time 
management s latest assessment found the estimated fair value for one reporting unit  including material nonamortizable race event sanctioning and renewable agreements  exceeded carrying values by a relatively nominal amount 
should this reporting unit or its indefinite lived intangible assets not achieve projected cash flows or profitability  or should actual capital expenditures exceed current plans  estimated fair values could be reduced to below carrying values resulting in material non cash impairment charges 
among other factors  our assessment assumes economic and industry condition improvements  and projected cash flow and profitability recovery  to pre recession levels within four years and strategic amounts of planned capital expenditures 
we are presently renovating  modernizing and significantly increasing permanent seating  and overall facilities  at kys  which will involve material capital expenditures in and over several years in amounts not yet finalized 
the profitability or success of these and other future capital projects are subject to numerous factors  conditions and assumptions  some of which are beyond our control  and if significantly negative or unfavorable  could become impaired and materially adversely affect our future financial condition or results of operations 
management believes there has since been no other events or circumstances which indicate possible impairment  and that no unrecognized impairment of property and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets exists through or as of december  the evaluations are subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
different economic or industry conditions or assumptions  changes in projected cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  or actual race date realignments that differ significantly from those assumed in the evaluation  could have a material adverse effect on the impairment evaluation and our future financial condition or results of operations

table of contents depreciable and amortizable lives for property and equipment and intangible assets depreciation and amortization is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
we have net property and equipment of  million and insignificant net amortizable intangible assets as of december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our property and equipment  other intangible assets and estimated useful lives 
as of december   we have nonamortizable intangible assets of million and goodwill of million for race event sanctioning and renewal agreements that are considered to have indefinite useful lives because their renewal and cash flow generation is expected to continue indefinitely 
useful lives are estimated based on outside cost segregation and valuation studies conducted on purchased or constructed speedway property and equipment and purchased intangible assets  historical experience  intended use  condition  available information for comparable assets  and other factors and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
management periodically reviews the estimated useful lives used to record depreciation and amortization expense  and believes such estimated useful lives are appropriate and no changes are expected at this time 
management also periodically reviews whether non amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets remains appropriate  and believes such non amortization is appropriate and no changes are expected at this time 
however  because we have a material investment in depreciable property and equipment and intangible assets  changes in depreciable and amortizable lives  should they occur  could have a significant impact on our financial condition or future results of operations 
realization of receivables and inventories management assesses realization of accounts and notes receivable and inventories  including any need for allowances for doubtful accounts or inventories 
management considers such factors as  among other things  customer creditworthiness  historical collection and sales experience for receivables  and current inventory levels  current and future market demand  and trends and conditions for inventories 
the assessment is subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation  which are subject to changes in market and economic conditions  including changes or deterioration in customer financial condition or merchandising distribution and other factors  that might adversely impact realization 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and income tax bases of assets and liabilities assuming they will be realized and settled at amounts reported in the financial statements 
income taxes are provided using the liability method whereby deferred income tax estimates  and significant items giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities  reflect management s assessment of future taxes likely to be paid  including timing  probability of realization and other relevant factors 
management s accounting for income taxes reflects its assessment of future tax liabilities based on assumptions and estimates for timing  likelihood of realization  and tax laws existing at the time of evaluation 
at december   net current deferred tax assets totaled  and net noncurrent deferred tax liabilities totaled million  after reduction for noncurrent deferred tax assets of million 
these net deferred tax liabilities will likely reverse in future years and could negatively impact cash flows from operations in the years in which reversal occurs 
as of december   valuation allowances of million are provided against deferred tax assets 
management has assessed deferred tax assets  after reduction for valuation allowances  and believes realization is more likely than not 
however  changes in tax laws  assumptions or estimates used in the accounting for income taxes  or changes or adjustments resulting from review by taxing authorities  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on amounts or timing of realization or settlement 
such effects could result in a material acceleration of income taxes currently payable or valuation charges for realization uncertainties  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or future results of operations 
our effective income tax rate was in compared to in as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  our tax rate reflects decreases in income tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions for favorable settlements with taxing authorities 
our tax rate reflects valuation allowances of approximately million against deferred tax assets  primarily associated with equity investee losses of ma because management is unable to determine that ultimate realization is more likely than not 
our effective income tax rates in future years may or may not be impacted by similar or other tax matters  which could result in relative increases or decreases in future income tax expense 
legal proceedings and contingencies as discussed above in legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various legal matters and intend to continue to defend existing legal actions in fiscal we use a combination of insurance and self insurance to manage various risks associated with its speedways  other properties and motorsports events  and other business risks

management does not believe the outcome of the lawsuits  incidents or other legal or business risk matters will have a material adverse effect on our future financial position  results of operations or cash flows
