item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those identified below  and those discussed in the section titled risk factors included elsewhere in this report

throughout this discussion  unless the context specifies or implies otherwise  the terms company  oncothyreon  biomira  we  us and our refer to oncothyreon inc  its predecessor  biomira inc  and its subsidiaries 
overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development of therapeutic products for the treatment of cancer 
our goal is to develop and commercialize novel synthetic vaccines and targeted small molecules that have the potential to improve the lives and outcomes of cancer patients 
our cancer vaccines are designed to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells  while our small molecule compounds are designed to inhibit the activity of specific cancer related proteins 
we are advancing our product candidates through in house development efforts and strategic collaborations 

table of contents we believe the quality and breadth of our product candidate pipeline  strategic collaborations and scientific team will potentially enable us to become an integrated biopharmaceutical company with a diversified portfolio of novel  commercialized therapeutics for major diseases 
our lead product candidate  stimuvax  is being evaluated in two phase clinical trials for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc 
we have granted an exclusive  worldwide license to merck kgaa of darmstadt  germany  or merck kgaa  for the development  manufacture and commercialization of stimuvax 
our pipeline of clinical stage proprietary small molecule product candidates was acquired by us in october from prolx pharmaceuticals corporation  or prolx 
we are currently focusing our internal development efforts on px  for which we initiated two phase trials in  and plan to initiate two additional phase trials in the first half of as of the date of this report  we have not licensed any rights to our small molecules to any third party and retain all development  commercialization and manufacturing rights 
we are also conducting preclinical development of ont formerly bglp  a cancer vaccine directed against a target similar to stimuvax  and which is proprietary to us 
in addition to our product candidates  we have developed novel vaccine technology that we may further develop ourselves and or license to others 
in may  we entered into a collaborative arrangement with merck kgaa to pursue joint global product research  clinical development and commercialization of stimuvax 
the collaboration covered the entire field of oncology for this product candidate and was documented in collaboration and supply agreements  which we refer to as the agreements 
in connection with the execution of the collaboration and supply agreements  we received up front cash payments of million and million  respectively 
in january  we and merck kgaa entered into a binding letter of intent  pursuant to which the agreements were amended and we granted additional rights to merck kgaa 
in august  we amended and restated our collaboration and supply agreements with merck kgaa  which we refer to as the agreements  which restructured the agreements and formalized the terms set forth in the letter of intent 
as a result of the agreements  merck kgaa obtained an exclusive world wide license with respect to the development and commercialization of stimuvax 
we had responsibility for the development of the manufacturing process and plans for the scale up for commercial manufacturing and merck kgaa had the right to act as a secondary manufacturer of stimuvax 
we also continued to be responsible for manufacture of the clinical and commercial supply of stimuvax for which merck kgaa agreed to pay us our cost of goods and provisions for certain contingent payments to us related to manufacturing scale up and process transfer were added 
the entry into the agreements triggered a million payment to us contemplated by the letter of intent  which we received in september in addition  under the agreements  we were entitled to receive a million payment tied to the transfer of certain assays and methodology related to the manufacture of stimuvax  which we received in december  a million payment tied to the transfer of certain stimuvax manufacturing technology  which we received in may  and a million payment tied to the earlier of receipt of the first manufacturing run at commercial scale of stimuvax and december   which we received in december  various additional contingent payments up to a maximum of million in the aggregate tied to a biologics license application  or bla  submission for first and second cancer indications  for regulatory approval of first and second cancer indications  and for various sales milestones  royalties in the low twenties based on net sales outside of north america and royalties based on net sales inside of north america with percentages in the mid twenties  depending on the territory in which the net sales occur 
if the manufacturing 
table of contents process payments due by december  were paid in full  the royalty rates would be reduced in all territories by  relative to the agreements and the letter of intent 
in december  we entered into a license agreement with merck kgaa which replaced the agreements 
pursuant to the license agreement  in addition to the rights granted pursuant to the agreements  we licensed to merck kgaa the exclusive right to manufacture stimuvax and the right to sublicense to other persons all such rights licensed  we transferred certain manufacturing know how to merck kgaa  we agreed not to develop any product  other than ont  that is competitive with stimuvax and we granted to merck a right of first negotiation in connection with any contemplated collaboration or license agreement with respect to the development or commercialization of ont upon the execution of the license agreement  all of our future performance obligations related to the collaboration for the clinical development and development of the manufacture process of stimuvax were removed and our continuing involvement in the development and manufacturing of stimuvax ceased 
in return for the license of manufacturing rights and transfer of manufacturing know how  we received an up front cash payment of approximately million 
the provisions with respect to contingent payments under the agreements remained unchanged and we may receive cash payments of up to million  which figure excludes the million received in december and million received prior to the execution of the license agreement 
we are also entitled to receive royalties based on net sales of stimuvax ranging from a percentage in the mid teens to high single digits  depending on the territory in which the net sales occur 
royalty rates were reduced relative to prior agreements by a specified amount which we believe is consistent with our estimated costs of goods  manufacturing scale up costs and certain other expenses assumed by merck kgaa 
in connection with the entry into the license agreement  we also entered into an asset purchase agreement  which  together with the license agreement we refer to as the agreements  pursuant to which we sold to merck kgaa certain assets related to the manufacture of  and inventory of  stimuvax  placebo and raw materials  and merck kgaa agreed to assume certain liabilities related to the manufacture of stimuvax and our obligations related to the lease of our edmonton  alberta  canada facility 
the plant and equipment in the edmonton facility and inventory of raw materials  work in process and finished goods were sold for a purchase price of million including the assumption of lease obligation of  and million  respectively 
the purchase price of the inventory was first offset against advances made in prior periods resulting in net cash to us of million 
in addition  employees at our former edmonton facility were transferred to an affiliate of merck kgaa  significantly reducing our operating expenses related to this program 
for additional information regarding our relationship with merck kgaa  see note collaborative and license agreements of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have not developed a therapeutic product to the commercial stage 
as a result  with the exception of the unusual effects of the transaction with merck kgaa in december  our revenue has been limited to date  and we do not expect to recognize any material revenue for the foreseeable future 
in particular  our ability to generate revenue in future periods will depend substantially on the progress of ongoing clinical trials for stimuvax and our small molecule compounds  our ability to obtain development and commercialization partners for our small molecule compounds  merck kgaa s success in obtaining regulatory approval for stimuvax  our success in obtaining regulatory approval for our small molecule compounds  and merck kgaa s and our respective abilities to establish commercial markets for these drugs 

table of contents any adverse clinical results relating to stimuvax or any decision by merck kgaa to discontinue its efforts to develop and commercialize the product would have a material and adverse effect on our future revenues and results of operations and would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
our small molecule compounds are much earlier in the development stage than stimuvax  and we do not expect to realize any revenues associated with the commercialization of our products candidates for the foreseeable future 
the continued research and development of our product candidates will require significant additional expenditures  including preclinical studies  clinical trials  manufacturing costs and the expenses of seeking regulatory approval 
we rely on third parties to conduct a portion of our preclinical studies  all of our clinical trials and all of the manufacturing of cgmp material 
we expect expenditures associated with these activities to increase in future years as we continue the development of our small molecule product candidates 
we have incurred substantial losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit totaled million 
we incurred a net loss of million for compared to a net loss of million for our net income resulted from the december transaction with merck kgaa when we recognized million of deferred revenue  million related to the bulk sale of inventory and million from the sale of stimuvax manufacturing rights and know how 
in future periods  we expect to continue to incur substantial net losses as we expand our research and development activities with respect to our small molecules product candidates 
to date we have funded our operations principally through the sale of our equity securities  cash received through our strategic alliance with merck kgaa  government grants  debt financings  and equipment financings 
we completed financings in september  in which we raised approximately million in gross proceeds  in may  in which we raised approximately million in gross proceeds and in august  in which we raised approximately million in gross proceeds  from the sale of our common stock and the issuance of warrants 
in addition  in february  we entered into a loan and security agreement  which we refer to as the loan agreement  pursuant to which we incurred million in term loan indebtedness and  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  may incur an additional million in term loan indebtedness 
see the section captioned liquidity and capital resources and note subsequent events of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for additional information 
because we have limited revenues and substantial research and development and operating expenses  we expect that we will in the future seek additional working capital funding from the sale of equity  debt securities  or loans or the licensing of rights to our product candidates 
key financial metrics revenue our revenue in was immaterial  however  the types of revenues described in this section are relevant for and historically  our revenue has been derived from payments under our collaborative and license agreements  our contract manufacturing activities  and miscellaneous licensing  royalty and other revenues from ancillary activities 
our arrangement with merck kgaa regarding stimuvax has historically contributed the substantial majority of our revenue 
licensing revenue from collaborative and license agreements 
revenue from collaborative and license agreements consists of up front cash payments for initial technology access or licensing fees and contingent payments triggered by the occurrence of specified events or other contingencies derived from our collaborative and license agreements 
royalties from the commercial sale of products derived from our collaborative and license agreements are reported as licensing  royalties  and other 
table of contents revenue 
for more information on revenue recognition for licensing revenue from collaborative and license agreements  see critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates revenue recognition licensing revenue from collaborative and license agreements below 
contract manufacturing 
revenue from contract manufacturing consists of payments received under the terms of supply agreements for the manufacturing of clinical trial material 
for more information on revenue recognition for contract manufacturing revenue  see critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates revenue recognition contract manufacturing below 
licensing  royalties  and other revenue 
licensing  royalties  and other revenue consist of revenue from sales of compounds and processes from patented technologies to third parties and royalties received pursuant to collaborative agreements and license agreements 
royalties based on reported sales  if any  of licensed products are recognized based on the terms of the applicable agreement when and if reported sales are reliably measurable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for more information on revenue recognition for licensing  royalties  and other revenue  see critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates revenue recognition licensing  royalties  and other revenue below 
expenses research and development manufacturing 
research and development manufacturing expense consists of costs associated with research activities as well as costs associated with our product development efforts  conducting preclinical studies  and clinical trial and manufacturing costs 
these expenses include external research and development expenses incurred pursuant to agreements with third party manufacturing organizations  technology access and licensing fees related to the use of proprietary third party technologies  employee and consultant related expenses  including salaries  stock based compensation expense  benefits  and related costs  and third party supplier expenses 
for the periods covered by this report  we have recognized research and development expenses  including those paid to third parties  as they have been incurred 
we credit funding received from government research and development grants against research and development expense when such funding is received in the period when incurred 
these credits totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these grants were small business innovation research  or sbir  grants that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of prolx on october  funding for the sbir grants was completed in no sbir grants were received in our research and development programs are at an early stage and may not result in any approved products 
product candidates that appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a variety of reasons 
for example  we have completed a phase trial of px in patients with advanced metastatic cancer 
based on results from this trial  we have determined not to advance px into additional trials 
similarly  any of our continuing product candidates may be found to be ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to complete clinical trials than we have anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  and may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality 
as part of our business strategy  we may enter into collaboration or license agreements with larger third party pharmaceutical companies to complete the development and commercialization of our small molecule or other product candidates  and it is unknown whether or on what terms we will be able to secure collaboration or license agreements for any candidate 
in addition  it is difficult to provide the impact of collaboration or license agreements  if any  on the development of product candidates 
establishing product development relationships with large pharmaceutical companies may 
table of contents or may not accelerate the time to completion or reduce our costs with respect to the development and commercialization of any product candidate 
as a result of these uncertainties and the other risks inherent in the drug development process  we cannot determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of any of our product candidates 
similarly  we cannot determine when  if  or to what extent we may generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any product candidate 
the timeframe for development of any product candidate  associated development costs  and the probability of regulatory and commercial success vary widely 
as a result  we continually evaluate our product candidates and make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to specific candidates 
these determinations are typically made based on consideration of numerous factors  including our evaluation of scientific and clinical trial data and an ongoing assessment of the product candidate s commercial prospects 
we anticipate that we will continue to develop our portfolio of product candidates  which will increase our research and development expense in future periods 
we do not expect any of our current candidates to be commercially available before  if at all 
until december  when we entered into the agreements  we reported costs associated with manufacturing stimuvax as manufacturing expense 
as a result of the entry into the agreements with merck kgaa in december  we will not incur manufacturing expenses associated with our arrangement with merck kgaa 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists principally of salaries  benefits  stock based compensation expense  and related costs for personnel in our executive  finance  accounting  information technology  and human resource functions 
other general and administrative expenses include an allocation of our facility costs and professional fees for legal  consulting  and accounting services 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation expense consists of depreciation of the cost of plant and equipment such as scientific  office  manufacturing  and computer equipment as well as depreciation of leasehold improvements 
investment and other income expense  net 
investment income and other net  consists of interest and other income on our cash and short term investments and foreign exchange gains and losses 
our short term investments consist of certificates of deposits issued by us banks and insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
historically  our short term investments and cash balances were denominated in either us dollars or canadian dollars  and the relative weighting between us dollars and canadian dollars varied based on market conditions and our operating requirements in the two countries 
however  with the reincorporation to  and concentration of our operating activities in  the united states  from october   our cash balances have been maintained predominantly in us dollar deposits 
we have historically not engaged in hedging transactions with respect to our us and canadian dollars investment assets or cash balances 
in  we were awarded a federal grant for million under the us government s qualifying therapeutic discovery project  or qtdp  program  which was recorded as other income since the amounts pertained to expenses incurred in and interest expense consists of interest incurred under capital lease agreements for computer equipment 
change in fair value of warrants 
warrants issued in connection with our securities offering in september and may are classified as a liability due to their settlement features and  as such  were recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of the closing of the transaction 
the warrants are marked to market for each financial reporting period  with changes in fair value recorded as a gain or loss in our statement of operations 
the fair value of the warrants is determined using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the use of significant judgment and estimates for the inputs used in the model 
for more information  see note fair value measurements and 
table of contents note share capital of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
provision benefit for income tax 
due to our history of significant losses  we do not recognize the benefit of net operating losses and have established a full valuation allowance since the realization of these benefits is not reasonably assured 
our income tax provision in relates to alternative minimum tax liability on the sale of manufacturing rights and know how to merck kgaa in december and the final process transfer payment received in in we recorded a tax benefit for recovery of taxes paid in the previous year 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates we have prepared this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations based on our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been included in this report beginning on page f and which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
these accounting principles require us to make significant estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of our consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon historical experience and information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
the securities and exchange commission considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations and if it requires the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this report 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and because they require critical management judgment and estimates about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition  goodwill impairment  stock based compensation  and warrants classified as liabilities 
revenue recognition our revenue in was immaterial  however  the types of revenues described in this section are relevant for and we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we evaluate revenue from arrangements with multiple deliverables to determine whether the deliverables represent one or more units of accounting 
a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting if the following separation criteria are met the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of any undelivered items  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  the delivery of undelivered items is 
table of contents probable and substantially in our control 
the relevant revenue recognition accounting policy is then applied to each unit of accounting 
we have historically generated revenue from the following activities licensing revenue from collaborative and license agreements 
revenue from collaborative and license agreements consists of up front cash payments for initial technology access or licensing fees and contingent payments triggered by the occurrence of specified events or other contingencies derived from our collaborative and license agreements 
royalties from the commercial sale of products derived from our collaborative and license agreements are reported as licensing  royalties  and other revenue 
if we have continuing obligations under a collaborative agreement and the deliverables within the collaboration cannot be separated into their own respective units of accounting  we utilize a multiple attribution model for revenue recognition as the revenue related to each deliverable within the arrangement should be recognized upon the culmination of the separate earnings processes and in such a manner that the accounting matches the economic substance of the deliverables included in the unit of accounting 
as such  up front cash payments are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the period of performance under the applicable agreement and contingent payments are recorded as deferred revenue when receivable and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated period of our ongoing obligations 
royalties based on reported sales of licensed products  if any  are recognized based on the terms of the applicable agreement when and if reported sales are reliably measurable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
with respect to our arrangement with merck kgaa  we determined that the estimated useful life of the products and estimated period of our ongoing obligations corresponded to the estimated life of the issued patents for such product 
under the agreements  payments that we received were recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the period from the date of execution of the agreements to we chose that amortization period because  at the time  we believed it reflected an anticipated period of market exclusivity based upon our expectation of the life of the patent protection  after which the market entry of competitive products would likely occur 
payments received pursuant to the letter of intent and the agreements were recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the remaining estimated product life of stimuvax  which was until upon entering into the agreements  all of our future performance obligations related to our collaboration with merck kgaa regarding stimuvax were removed and our continuing involvement in the development and manufacturing of stimuvax ceased  therefore  we recognized the balance of all previously recorded deferred revenue relating to our arrangement with merck kgaa 
similarly  our receipt of the final manufacturing process transfer milestone payment in december was recognized currently since we had no continuing obligations pursuant to such arrangement 
any future contingent payments we receive pursuant to the license agreement will be immediately recognized in revenue 
contract manufacturing 
revenue from contract manufacturing consists of payments received under the terms of supply agreements for the manufacturing of clinical trial material 
such payments compensate us for the cost of manufacturing clinical trial material and are recognized after shipment of the clinical trial material and upon the earlier of the expiration of a specified return period  as returns cannot be reasonably estimated  and formal acceptance of the clinical trial material by the customer 
pursuant to the letter of intent  we continued to be responsible for the manufacturing of the clinical and commercial supply of stimuvax for which merck kgaa agreed to pay us our cost of manufacturing which included amounts owed to third parties during merck kgaa s 
table of contents payments to us for the clinical supply of stimuvax were reported as contract manufacturing revenue 
upon entering into the asset purchase agreement with merck kgaa in december  we recognized proceeds from the sale of inventory of raw materials  work in process and finished goods as contract manufacturing revenue 
in connection with the december agreements  we granted to merck kgaa the exclusive right to manufacture stimuvax and transferred our manufacturing know how and capabilities to merck kgaa 
as a result  we do not anticipate receiving such contract manufacturing revenue in the foreseeable future 
licensing  royalties  and other revenue 
licensing  royalties  and other revenue consists of revenue from sales of compounds and processes from patented technologies to third parties and royalties received pursuant to collaborative agreements and license agreements 
royalties based on reported sales  if any  of licensed products are recognized based on the terms of the applicable agreement when and if reported sales are reliably measurable and collectability is reasonably assured 
as of the date of this report  we have not received any royalties pursuant to our arrangement with merck kgaa 
if we have no continuing obligations under a license agreement  or a license deliverable qualifies as a separate unit of accounting included in a collaborative arrangement  consideration that is allocated to the license deliverable is recognized as revenue upon commencement of the license term and contingent payments are recognized as revenue upon the occurrence of the events or contingencies provided for in such agreement  assuming collectability is reasonably assured 
goodwill impairment goodwill is carried at cost and is not amortized  but is reviewed annually for impairment on october of each year  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized 
as of december   we had one reporting unit and there was a substantial excess of fair value compared to the carrying value 
there were no impairment charges recorded for any of the periods presented 
stock based compensation we maintain a share option plan under which an aggregate of  shares of common stock underlie outstanding options as of december  and an aggregate of  shares of common stock were available for future issuance 
we maintain a restricted share unit plan under which an aggregate of  shares of common stock underlie restricted stock units  or rsus  as of december  and an aggregate of  shares of common stock were available for future issuance 
we have generally granted options to our employees and directors under the share option plan  and we have granted rsus to non employee directors under the restricted share unit plan 
prior to the april  amendment to our share option plan  we granted options with an exercise price denominated in canadian dollars equal to the closing price of our shares on the toronto stock exchange on the trading day immediately prior to the date of grant 
on and after april   we granted options with an exercise price denominated in us dollars equal to the closing price of our shares on the nasdaq global market on the date of grant 
on and after june  the fair value of the restricted share units has been determined to be the equivalent of our common shares closing trading price on the date immediately prior to the grant as quoted on the nasdaq global market 
prior to june   the fair value was computed using the closing trading price on the date immediately prior to the grant as quoted in canadian dollars on the toronto stock exchange 
we use the black scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards  which requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions to determine the fair value of stock based awards  including the option s expected term 
table of contents and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
we recognize the value of the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest as expense over the requisite vesting periods on a straight line basis for the entire award in our consolidated statements of operations 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
historically we have based the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option on the yield available on government of canada benchmark bonds with an equivalent expected term 
subsequent to april   we use the yield at the time of grant of a us treasury security 
the expected life of options in years represents the period of time stock based awards are expected to be outstanding  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the awards  vesting schedules and historical employee behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock for a period equal to the stock option s expected life 
warrant liability in may and september  we issued warrants to purchase  of which  warrants were exercised in  and  shares of our common stock respectively in connection with a registered direct offering of our common stock and warrants 
these warrants are classified as liabilities due to potential cash settlement upon the occurrence of certain transactions specified in the warrant agreement related to the warrants and  in the case of the warrants issued in may  certain adjustments that may be made to the terms of the warrants if we issue or sell shares below the exercise price 
the september equity financing triggered certain adjustment provisions in the may warrants and  as a result  the aggregate number of shares underlying such unexercised warrants increased by  to  as of december  and the per share exercise price decreased from to 
pursuant to the terms of the warrant agreement  the terms of the warrants issued in may will not be further adjusted for any future transactions 
accordingly  the fair value of the warrants is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability  and such fair value is adjusted at each financial reporting period with the adjustment to fair value reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
the fair value of the warrants is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
fluctuations in the assumptions and factors used in the black scholes model can result in adjustments to the fair value of the warrants reflected on our balance sheet and  therefore  our statement of operations 
on december   we changed the way we estimated volatility when determining the fair value of the warrants using the black scholes model 
for more information  see note fair value measurements of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents results of operations for the years ended december   and the following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated 
overview years ended december  in millions  except per share amounts revenue expenses change in fair value of warrant liability benefit provision for income tax net income loss earnings loss per share basic earnings loss per share diluted we incurred a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in the decrease in our net loss was primarily due to the decline in the fair value of our warrant liability  which was attributable principally to the decrease in the price of our common stock 
this was substantially offset by higher expenses in research and development related to the development of px and ont in addition  general and administrative expenses were higher due to higher professional fees incurred in with respect to analysis of the accounting for our arrangement with merck kgaa and a proposed transaction  which was ultimately not consummated  pursuant to which we had intended to monetize certain canadian tax losses 
the net loss of million in compared to a net income of million in was primarily driven by the entry into the agreements with merck kgaa which resulted in the recognition of million in revenue under the arrangement superseded by the license agreement and million from the license of the manufacturing rights to stimuvax and know how 
pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  we recognized million in revenue along with the associated cost of sales of million 
the million decrease in expenses from is due to reduce cost of operations related to the transfer of our canadian facility to merck kgaa in december in and  our operating loss reflected a gain and loss respectively related to the change in fair value of warrants issued in connection with our september and may financings 
based on our development plans for our small molecule and vaccine candidates we will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
revenue years ended december  in millions licensing revenues from collaborative and license agreements contract manufacturing licensing  royalties  and other revenue as we licensed our manufacturing rights and transferred our manufacturing know how and capabilities to merck kgaa in december  we did not receive any revenues from 
table of contents contract manufacturing during and license revenue declined by million in to million from million in the license revenue primarily reflects the acceleration of the recognition of million in revenue that had been previously deferred and million from the sale of our manufacturing rights and know how to merck kgaa 
license revenue in included a million contractually obligated payment from merck kgaa 
we do not expect revenue from the license of stimuvax until the submission  by merck kgaa  of the bla for the first indication 
research and development manufacturing expense years ended december  in millions research and development manufacturing the million  or  increase in research and development expenses for compared to was primarily driven by a million increase in contract laboratory services and contract manufacturing and lab supplies  related to the development of px and ont salaries and benefits and clinical trial expenses were higher by million and million  respectively  due to increased headcount and greater clinical trial activity 
grant revenue used to offset research and development expenses decreased to zero in from million in  since our activities related to the sbir grant ceased in as we continue with our development on px and ont  we expect that our research and development costs will increase in the million  or  decrease in research and development expenses for compared to was due principally to the transfer of our edmonton facility to merck kgaa in december which included the transfer of employees resulting in declines in salaries and compensation related expenses of million  facility overhead costs of million  lab supplies and consumables costs of million and consultant compensation of million 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in clinical research and contract manufacturing of million and million respectively  relating to our small molecule candidates px and px in addition  grant revenue declined in by million to million from million in since we licensed our manufacturing rights and transferred our manufacturing know how and capabilities to merck kgaa in december  we did not incur any costs related to this activity in and general and administrative years ended december  in millions general and administrative the million increase in relative to was principally due to a million increase in professional fees incurred related to regulatory compliance in the first half of and a million increase in directors and officers insurance premiums 
the increase was partially offset by lower stock based compensation expense of million and lower overhead allocation of million  which includes rent  repair and maintenance  communication expenses and supplies 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease during the million decline in relative to was principally due to the consolidation of our operations in the united states 
this decline is attributable to decreases in staffing 
table of contents costs of million  professional fees of million  and facility and overhead of million 
depreciation and amortization years ended december  in millions depreciation and amortization depreciation expense for increased by million compared to primarily due to the build out of laboratory facilities that were placed in service in the million decrease in our depreciation expense for compared to was due to the transfer of our edmonton facility to merck kgaa in december investment and other income  net years ended december  in millions investment and other income  net investment and other income  net  increased by million for compared to primarily due to receipt of a government grant of million and higher average yields on investments in our investment and other income  net was not material in as million in investment income was offset by foreign exchange losses 
in  the million decrease in investment and other income compared to was primarily attributable to a decrease in investment income due to lower investment yields 
change in fair value of warrant liability years ended december  in millions change in fair value of warrant liability the million recorded was due to the decline in fair value of warrant liability for the year ended such decline was attributable principally to the decrease in the price of our common stock and pertains to warrants issued in connection with the september and may financings 
on december   we changed the way we estimated volatility when determining the fair value of the warrants using the black scholes model 
for more information  see note fair value measurements of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the warrants issued in may were subject to certain adjustments if we issued or sold shares below the original exercise price 
a september equity financing triggered such adjustment provisions and  as a result  the aggregate number of shares underlying such unexercised warrants increased by  to  as of december  and the per share exercise price decreased from to 
pursuant to the terms of the warrant agreement  the terms of the warrants issued in may will not be further adjusted for any future transactions 
the million loss on the change in fair value of warrant liability for the year ended  relative to the comparable prior year period  was attributable to the warrants issued in connection with the may financing 

table of contents income tax benefit provision years ended december  in millions income tax benefit provision in  we recorded a tax benefit for the recovery of taxes paid in the previous year 
the provision for income tax in relates to alternative minimum tax incurred in connection with the december transactions with merck kgaa and the final process manufacturing transfer payment received during while we have incurred substantial losses in historical periods except for  there are no assurances that we will realize any tax benefits and we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and working capital as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
our cash equivalents are invested in money market funds and certificates of deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
our primary source of cash has historically been proceeds from the issuance of equity securities  debt and equipment financings  and payments to us under licensing and collaboration agreements 
these proceeds have been used to fund our operations 
our cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  compared to million as of december   a decrease of million  or 
the net decrease reflects net cash used in operations of million  net purchases of short term investments of million and purchases of capital assets of million offset by million in net cash received from a financing in september as of december   our working capital was million compared to million as of december   a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in working capital was primarily attributable to a million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments offset by a million increase in government grants receivable  a million increase in receivables and prepaid expenses and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents is sufficient to finance our operations for at least the next months 
nevertheless  we expect that we will require additional capital from time to time in the future in order to continue the development of products in our pipeline and to expand our product portfolio 
we would expect to seek additional financing from the sale and issuance of equity or debt securities  and we cannot predict that financing will be available when and as we need financing or that  if available  the financing terms will be commercially reasonable 
if we are unable to raise additional financing when and if we require  it would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
to the extent we issue additional equity securities  our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution 
in february  we entered into a loan agreement with ge capital  pursuant to which the lenders extended to us an initial term loan with an aggregate principal amount of million 
in addition  we may borrow a second term loan with an aggregate principal amount of million  at our option and subject to satisfying certain conditions on or before november  the conditions to borrow the second term loan include requirements that we have months of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as calculated in the loan agreement as of the time of incurrence  the start trial for stimuvax is continuing or enrollment has been discontinued because such trial has met a 
table of contents positive efficacy endpoint at an interim analysis as determined by an independent data safety monitoring board overseeing such trial and the study of at least one clinical indication in our px program is continuing 
the proceeds of the initial term loan  after payment of lender fees and expenses  were approximately million 
the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes  including research and product development  such as funding pre clinical studies and clinical trials and otherwise moving product candidates towards commercialization  or the possible acquisition or licensing of new product candidates or technology which could result in other product candidates 
pending application of the net proceeds  we intend to invest the net proceeds in short term  investment grade  interest bearing instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the loan agreement 
our certificate of incorporation provides for the mandatory redemption of shares of our class ua preferred stock if we realize net profits in any year 
see note share capital of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
for this purpose  net profits 
means the after tax profits determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  where relevant  consistently applied 
the certificate of incorporation does not specify the jurisdiction whose generally accepted accounting principles would apply for the redemption provision 
at the time of the original issuance of the shares  we were a corporation organized under the federal laws of canada  and our principal operations were located in canada 
in addition  the original purchaser and current holder of the class ua preferred stock is a canadian entity 
in connection with our reincorporation in delaware  we disclosed that the rights  preferences and privileges of the shares would remain unchanged except as required by delaware law  and the mandatory redemption provisions were not changed 
in addition  the formula for determining the price at which such shares would be redeemed is expressed in canadian dollars 
therefore  if challenged  we believe that a delaware court would determine that net profits be interpreted in accordance with canadian gaap 
as a result of the december merck kgaa transaction  we recognized on a one time basis all deferred revenue relating to stimuvax  under both us gaap and canadian gaap 
under us gaap this resulted in net income 
however  under canadian gaap we were required to recognize an impairment on intangible assets which resulted in a net loss for and therefore did not redeem any shares of class ua preferred stock in if in the future we recognize net income under canadian gaap  or any successor to such principles  or if the holder of class ua preferred stock were to challenge  and prevail in a dispute involving  the interpretation of the mandatory redemption provision  we may be required to redeem such shares which would have an adverse effect on our cash position 
the maximum aggregate amount that we would be required to pay to redeem such shares is can million 
cash flows from operating activities cash used in operating activities is primarily driven by our net income loss 
however  operating cash flows differ from net income loss as a result of non cash charges or differences in the timing of cash flows and earnings recognition 
net cash used in operating activities totaled million in  compared to million in the increase in net cash used in operating activities for as compared to was primarily due to an increase in research and development and general and administrative expenses 
in  accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by million mainly due to pay downs in accrued manufacturing and professional fees 
accrued compensation and 
table of contents related costs decreased million in cash during the year as we made payments on severance agreements related to the restructuring in in addition accounts receivable decreased by million in principally on the collection of withheld taxes on the payment from merck kgaa for the sale of our manufacturing rights and know how 
cash flows from investing activities we had cash outflows of million from investing activities during  a decrease of million from the million outflow in this change was attributable principally to lower net purchases of short term investments of million in compared to million in and lower expenditures on capital assets of million 
we had cash outflows of million from investing activities during the year ended december   a fluctuation of million from the million inflows in the year ended december  this change was attributable principally to net purchases of short term investments of million in compared to net redemptions in the prior year of million and higher expenditures on capital assets of million 
cash flows from financing activities we generated million of net cash during from the september financing  which involved the issuance of common stock and warrants 
during the year ended december   we generated million of net cash from financings completed in may and august  each of which involved the issuance of common stock and warrants 
contractual obligations and contingencies in our continuing operations  we have entered into long term contractual arrangements from time to time for our facilities  debt financing  the provision of goods and services  and acquisition of technology access rights  among others 
the following table presents contractual obligations arising from these arrangements as of december  payments due by period less than after total year years years years in thousands operating leases in may  we entered into a sublease for an office and laboratory facility in seattle  washington totaling approximately  square feet where we have consolidated our operations 
the sublease expires on december  the sublease provides for a base monthly rent of  increasing to  in may we also entered into a lease directly with the landlord of such facility which will have a six year term beginning at the expiration of the sublease 
the lease provides for a base monthly rent of  increasing to  in we also have entered into operating lease obligations through september for certain office equipment 
in connection with the acquisition of prolx  we assumed two loan agreements under which approximately  was outstanding at december  we are required to repay such loans if we commercialize or sell the product that was the subject of such agreements 
in february  we provided notice to the counterparty to such agreements that we do not intend to commercialize such product 
as a result  such agreements will be terminated march and we do not expect to be required to repay such loans 
in connection with the acquisition of prolx  we may become obligated to issue additional shares of our common stock to the former stockholders of prolx upon satisfaction of certain milestones 
we may become obligated to issue shares of our common stock with a fair market value of million determined based on a weighted average trading price at the time of issuance upon the initiation of the first phase clinical trial for a prolx 
table of contents product 
we may become obligated to issue shares of our common stock with a fair market value of million determined based on a weighted average trading price at the time of issuance upon regulatory approval of a prolx product in a major market 
under certain licensing arrangements for technologies incorporated into our product candidates  we are contractually committed to payment of ongoing licensing fees and royalties  as well as contingent payments when certain milestones as defined in the agreements have been achieved 
guarantees and indemnification in the ordinary course of our business  we have entered into agreements with our collaboration partners  vendors  and other persons and entities that include guarantees or indemnity provisions 
for example  our agreements with merck kgaa and the former stockholders of prolx contain certain tax indemnification provisions  and we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors 
based on information known to us as of december   we believe that our exposure related to these guarantees and indemnification obligations is not material 
off balance sheet arrangements during the period presented  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for another contractually narrow or limited purpose 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange risk as of december  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our cash and cash equivalents were denominated in canadian dollars 
as a result  we are not exposed to any significant foreign exchange risk 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of these assets as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short term nature of our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
a basis point decline in interest rates  occurring january  and sustained throughout the period ended december   would have resulted in a decline in investment income of approximately million for that same period
