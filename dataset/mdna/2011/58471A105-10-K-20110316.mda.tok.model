item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations 
you should read this discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those described in risk factors under item a and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading global provider of saas based clinical technology solutions that enhance the efficiency of our customers clinical development processes from concept to conclusion  optimizing their research and development investments 
our solutions allow our customers to achieve clinical results more efficiently and effectively by streamlining the design  planning and management of key aspects of the clinical development process  including protocol development  trial planning and management  user and learning management  randomization and trial supply management  monitoring  clinical data capture  management and reporting 
the demand for electronic clinical solutions  such as those provided by us  has been driven by the increasing complexity and cost associated with paper based trials and inefficiencies with early generation edc solutions 
paper based trials may delay the clinical development process  impair data quality and prevent real time decision making  while traditional edc solutions have faced challenges with integration  site requirements  customization and scalability 
we have grown our revenues significantly since inception by expanding our customer base  increasing penetration with existing customers  enhancing our products and services and growing our indirect channel 
in order to achieve and sustain our growth objectives  we have and will continue to invest in key areas  including new personnel  particularly in direct domestic and international sales activities  resources to support our product development  including product functionality and platform  marketing programs to build brand awareness  and infrastructure to support growth 
we derive a majority of our application services revenues through multi study arrangements for a pre determined number of studies 
we also offer our application services on a single study basis that allows customers to use our solution for a limited number of studies or to evaluate it prior to committing to multi study arrangements 
we invest heavily in training our customers  their investigators and other third parties to configure clinical trials independently 
we believe this knowledge transfer accelerates customer adoption of our solutions 
we use a number of metrics to evaluate and manage our business 
these metrics include customer growth  customer retention rate  revenues from lost customers  geographic contribution  and backlog 
our customer base has grown from at january  to at december  our relationships with some of these customers include multiple divisions and business units at various domestic and international locations 
we generate revenues from sales to new customers as well as sales and renewals from our existing customers 
our global direct sales organization represents our primary source of sales  with an increasing number 
table of contents of sales generated through our cro relationships 
our customer retention rate was  and in  and  respectively 
we calculate customer retention based upon the number of customers that existed both at the beginning and end of the relevant period 
traditionally  we maintain a high percentage of customer retention and hence the revenue impact from lost customers is insignificant to our total revenues 
revenues from lost customers accounted for  and of total prior year revenues in  and  respectively 
to calculate the impact of customers lost during the period  we consider the revenues recognized from lost customers during the most recent prior fiscal year as a percentage of total company revenues from the same period 
we believe revenues from lost customers coupled with customer retention rate give the best sense of volume and scale of customer loss and retention 
our presentation of customer retention and revenues from lost customers may differ from other companies in our industry 
we manage our business as one reportable segment 
historically  we have generated most of our revenues from sales to customers located in the united states 
however  revenues generated from customers located in europe and asia including australia represent a significant portion of overall revenues 
revenues generated from customers located in europe represented approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
revenues generated from customers in asia represented approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
we expect sales from customers in europe and asia to continue to represent a significant portion of total sales as we continue to serve existing and new customers in these markets 
our backlog is primarily associated with application services and represents the total future contract value of outstanding  multi study and single study arrangements  billed and unbilled  at a point in time 
thus  our backlog includes deferred revenue 
revenue generated in any given period is a function of revenue recognized from the beginning of period backlog  contract renewals  and new customer contracts 
for this reason  backlog at the beginning of any period is not necessarily indicative of long term future performance 
we monitor as an annual metric the amount of revenues expected to be recognized from backlog over the current fiscal year  or full year backlog 
as of january  and  we had full year backlog of approximately million and million  respectively 
our presentation of backlog may differ from other companies in our industry 
we consider the global adoption of clinical development technologies to be essential to our future growth 
our future growth will also depend on our ability to sustain the high levels of customer satisfaction and our ability to increase sales to existing customers 
in addition  the market for our products is often characterized by rapid technological change and evolving regulatory standards 
our future growth is dependent on the successful development and introduction of new products and enhancements 
to address these challenges  we will continue to expand our direct and indirect sales channels in domestic and international markets  pursue research and development as well as acquisition opportunities to expand and enhance our product offerings  expand our marketing efforts  and drive customer adoption through our knowledge transfer professional services offerings 
our success in these areas will depend upon our abilities to execute on our operational plans  interpret and respond to customer and regulatory requirements  and retain key staff 
acquisition of fast track on march   we acquired fast track  a provider of clinical trial planning solutions 
with this acquisition  we extended our ability to serve customers throughout the clinical research process with solutions that improve efficiencies in protocol development and trial planning  contracting and negotiation 
we paid total consideration of approximately million  which consisted of the issuance of approximately thousand shares of common stock in exchange for all fast track s existing preferred stock and common stock as well as approximately thousand shares of common stock reserved for the exercise of outstanding warrants and vested employee stock options 
our results of operations for and for subsequent periods include the operations of fast track since the date of acquisition 

table of contents sources of revenues we derive revenues from application services and professional services 
application services consist of multi study or single study arrangements  which give our customers the right to use our software solutions  hosting and site support  as well as clinical trial planning software solutions we acquired from fast track 
professional services consist of assisting our customers and partners with the design  workflow  implementation and management of their clinical trials 
our application services are principally provided for both multi study arrangements  which grant customers the right to manage up to a predetermined number of clinical trials for a term generally ranging from three to five years  as well as single study arrangements that allow customers to use application services for an individual study or to evaluate our application services prior to committing to multi study arrangements 
many of our customers have migrated from single study arrangements to multi study arrangements and multi study arrangements represent the majority of our application services revenues 
we also offer applications that improve efficiencies for clinical trials from concept to conclusion 
our professional services provide our customers with reliable  repeatable and cost effective implementation and training in the use of our application services 
we also offer consulting services to advise customers on ways to optimize their clinical development processes from trial concept to conclusion 
professional services revenues have represented a significant portion of overall revenues to date 
we expect professional services revenues to decline as a percentage of total revenues as our customers and partners become more adept at the management and configuration of their clinical trials as part of our knowledge transfer efforts 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of costs related to hosting  maintaining and supporting our application suite and delivering our professional services and support 
these costs include salaries  benefits  bonuses and stock based compensation for our data center and professional services staff 
cost of revenues also includes costs associated with our data center  including networking and related depreciation expense  as well as outside service provider costs  amortization expense and general overhead 
we allocate general overhead  such as applicable shared rent and utilities  to cost of revenues based on relative headcount 
the costs associated with providing professional services are recognized as such costs are incurred and are significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than the costs associated with delivering our application services due to the labor costs associated with providing professional services 
over the long term  we believe that cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues will decrease 
operating costs and expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our research and development staff  including salaries  benefits  bonuses and stock based compensation  the cost of certain third party service providers and allocated overhead 
we have focused our research and development efforts on expanding the functionality and ease of use of our applications 
we expect research and development costs to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we intend to release new features and functionality designed to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the clinical development process for our customers 
over the long term  we believe that research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues will remain relatively constant 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our sales and marketing staff  including salaries  benefits  bonuses and stock based compensation  commissions  travel costs  and marketing and promotional events  corporate communications  advertising  other brand building and product marketing expenses and allocated overhead 
our sales and marketing expenses have increased in absolute dollars primarily due to our ongoing substantial investments in customer acquisition 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars 
over the long term  we believe that sales and marketing expenses will decline slightly as a percentage of total revenues 

table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for executive  legal  quality assurance  finance and human resources  including salaries  benefits  bonuses and stock based compensation  professional fees  insurance premiums  allocated overhead and other corporate expenses  including certain one time costs in anticipation of becoming a public company incurred in and during  we strengthened our management and corporate infrastructure  particularly in our finance department  and implemented financial reporting  compliance and other infrastructure associated with being a public company 
on an ongoing basis  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to add administrative personnel and incur additional professional fees and other expenses resulting from continued growth and the compliance requirements of operating as a public company 
over the long term  we believe that general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues will decrease 
income tax expense prior to  income tax expense consisted primarily of foreign income taxes imposed on our foreign subsidiaries in the united kingdom and japan 
we have us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income which do not fully expire until we do not realize an income tax benefit for the majority of our net operating loss carryforwards and other domestic net deferred tax assets as we have yet to determine that it is more likely than not that our future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize these tax benefits 
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  including the net operating loss carryforwards  we assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize our existing deferred tax assets 
a significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated has been our history of operating losses since our inception and continuing through while and have resulted in profitability  the existence of and the history of such negative evidence limits our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for future growth 
based on this evaluation  as of december   we have provided a valuation allowance against the majority of our domestic net deferred tax assets as their future utilization remains uncertain at this time 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be adjusted if forecasts of future taxable income during the carryforward period are ultimately achieved and we continue to be profitable 
due to the cumulative impact of our ipo in june  coupled with our secondary offering in december  an ownership change as defined by section of the internal revenue code  or section  occurred in early december as a result  utilization of our federal net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under section during the fourth quarter of  we completed a tax analysis which enabled us to increase our section limitation 
pursuant to the internal revenue service guidance  we are entitled to an increase in section limitation by assuming a deemed sale of assets  which is calculated based on a valuation of all of our assets and liabilities 
based upon the completion of such valuation  we were able to increase our section limitation by an additional million 
as a result  our federal taxable income for the years ended december  and was fully offset by our federal net operating loss carryforwards 
with the increase in our section limitation  we expect that it will take a shorter period of time than previously estimated to fully utilize our federal net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
due to the increase in our section limitation  we do not expect our provision for federal income tax to increase in the near term 
however  we expect our overall income tax expense to increase slightly in absolute dollars due to state and local income taxes  as well as foreign income taxes as our income from international operations continues to grow 
see note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for more information regarding our income taxes 

table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our critical accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgments underlying them  require the application of significant judgment in the preparation of our financial statements  and as a result they are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  we use our judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in calculating estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition we derive our revenues from the sale of application services and the rendering of professional services 
we recognize revenues when all of the following conditions are satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  service has been delivered to the customer  amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fees is reasonably assured or probable 
application services we typically enter into multi study and single study arrangements that include the sale of software licenses that provide our customers the right to use our software  as well as hosting and other support services  to be provided over a specified term 
we recognize revenues ratably over the term of the arrangement  beginning with the commencement of the arrangement term  which correlates with the activation of the hosting services  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
the term of the arrangement includes optional renewal periods if such renewal periods are likely to be exercised 
professional services we also provide a range of professional services that our customers have the ability to utilize on an as needed basis 
these services generally include training  implementation  interface creation  trial configuration  data testing  reporting  procedure documentation and other customer specific services 
professional services do not result in significant alterations to our underlying software 
in certain situations  when professional services are sold separate and apart from application services  they are recognized as services are rendered 
combined arrangements our professional services are typically sold together with application services as a component of a single study or multi study arrangement 
we account for arrangements that include both application services and professional services as a combined single unit of accounting and the related revenues are recognized ratably beginning with the commencement of the arrangement term  assuming all other remaining revenue recognition criteria are met 
management s estimate of fair value for professional services is used to derive a reasonable approximation for presenting application services and professional services separately in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents deferred revenue deferred revenue consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met 
amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
we invoice our customers in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract  usually in installments in advance of the related service period 
accordingly  the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of outstanding arrangements 
payment terms are net to days 
deferred revenue that will be recognized during the subsequent month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion as non current deferred revenue 
in some instances  customers elect to renew their application services arrangements prior to the original termination date of the arrangement 
the renewed application services agreement provides support for in process clinical trials  and includes the right to use the software for initial clinical studies 
as such  the unrecognized portion of the deferred revenue associated with the initial arrangement is aggregated with the consideration received upon renewal and recognized as revenues over the renewed term of the application services arrangements 
stock based compensation we currently follow asc  compensation stock compensation  to account for all of our stock based compensation plans 
according to asc  all forms of share based payments to employees  including employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans  are treated the same as any other form of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the statement of operations 
under asc  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and the expense is recognized ratably over the award s vesting period 
for all grants  we recognize compensation cost under the straight line method 
we measure the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model which requires the use of several estimates  including the expected volatility of our stock price  the expected life of the option  risk free interest rates  and expected dividend yield 
the use of different assumptions in the black scholes pricing model would result in different amounts of stock based compensation expense 
furthermore  if different assumptions are used in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future 
prior to the completion of our ipo in june  we were not a publicly traded company and had limited historical information on the price of our stock as well as employees stock option exercise behavior 
as a result  we could not rely on historical experience alone to develop assumptions for the expected stock price volatility and the expected life of options 
as such  our expected stock price volatility was estimated with reference to a peer group of companies and our expected life of options was estimated based on the likely date of exercise in accordance with our internal studies of historical experience and projected exercise behavior as opposed to the actual life of the options 
subsequent to the completion of our ipo  we continue to use stock price volatility of our peer group of companies as a basis for determining the expected volatility together with the closing prices of our publicly traded stock 
we will increase the weight of our own stock price volatility within the weighted average over time as sufficient historical experience of our stock price is established 
in addition  as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data in the period since our stock began being publicly traded to provide a 
table of contents reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected life  we use the simplified method as allowed under sec staff accounting bulletin no 
for estimating the expected life of options as all of our options qualify as plain vanilla options 
the risk free interest rate is based on the united states treasury yield curve with a maturity tied to the expected life of the option 
we have not and do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock 
the fair value of each nonvested restricted stock award grant is measured as if the nonvested restricted stock was vested and issued on the grant date 
we recorded stock based compensation of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
in future periods  stock based compensation expense is expected to increase as a result of our existing unrecognized stock based compensation and as we issue additional equity based awards to continue to attract and retain employees and non employee directors 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized stock based compensation costs related to all non vested equity awards granted under our stock option plan and plan 
the unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over an average period of years for stock options and years for restricted stock awards as of december  goodwill and intangibles goodwill  which consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired  is evaluated for impairment using a two step process that is performed at least annually on october of each year  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
the first step is a comparison of the fair value of an internal reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step is unnecessary 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the goodwill to a determination of the implied value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater that the implied value  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
the implied value of goodwill is determined as of the test date by performing a purchase price allocation  as if the reporting unit had just been acquired  using currently estimated fair values of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  together with an estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit taken as a whole 
the estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit is based upon information available regarding our market capitalization  prices of similar groups of assets  or other valuation techniques including present value techniques based upon estimates of future cash flow 
intangible assets  including technology  database  customer relationships  and customer contracts arising from the acquisition of fast track in march  are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and are amortized using a method which reflects the pattern in which the economic benefit of the related intangible asset is utilized 
we had intangible assets of million and million  respectively as of december  and for intangible assets subject to amortization  impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset 
as of december  and  we had goodwill of million 
the results of our annual impairment test performed on october  indicated that our goodwill was not impaired 
in  as part of our annual goodwill impairment test  we reassessed our reporting units 
based on the results of that assessment  we considered our market capitalization under the market approach in determining the estimate of fair value of our reporting unit  as management believed that our market capitalization based on quoted market prices was the best evidence in determining such estimated fair value 
the determination of whether or not goodwill or acquired 
table of contents intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting unit 
we set criteria of assumptions and estimates that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management 
changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  as prescribed by asc  income taxes  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
in addition  we follow asc for the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
under asc  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
we had approximately million and million of federal net operating loss carryforwards as of december  and  respectively  available to offset future taxable income  expiring from through we also had net operating loss carryforwards for state and local income tax purposes in aggregate of approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively  available to offset future state and local taxable income  expiring from through certain net operating loss carryforwards were obtained through our acquisition of fast track in and are subject to limitations under section the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards is subject to limitations under the internal revenue code 
due to this limitation and the uncertainty if our future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize these tax benefits  we provided a valuation allowance against the majority of our domestic net deferred tax assets as their future utilization is uncertain at this time 
the net change in the valuation allowance was a decrease of million in  a decrease of million in and an increase of million in results of operations we recognize revenues from applications services arrangements ratably over the terms of these arrangements 
as a result  a substantial majority of our application services revenues in each quarter are generated from arrangements entered into during prior periods 
consequently  an increase or a decrease in new application services arrangements in any one quarter may not significantly affect our results of operations in that quarter 
additionally  when we sell application services and professional services in a combined arrangement  which is our typical practice  we recognize revenues from professional services ratably over the term of the arrangement  rather than as the professional services are delivered  which varies throughout the arrangement term 
accordingly  a significant portion of the revenues for professional services performed in any reporting period will be deferred to future periods 
we recognize expenses related to our professional services in the period in which the expenses are incurred 
as a result  our professional services revenues and gross margin for any reporting period may not be reflective of the professional services delivered during that reporting period or of the current business trends with respect to our professional services

application services revenues 
revenues from application services increased million  or  to million in from million in the majority of the increase in application services revenues was derived from increased activity in our existing large customers  primarily resulting from new studies and renewals 
we also benefited from increased product uptake and cross selling to existing customers  as well as new customer additions 
we increased the number of customers to compared with a year ago and continued our success in adding new midmarket customers 
revenues from new customers accounted for of the total increase in application services revenues 
application services revenues also benefitted from a million one time acceleration of revenue recognition resulting from a customer contract termination in the fourth quarter of we also continue to benefit from the revenue stream from our multi study arrangements  which increased by compared with the prior period

professional services revenues 
revenues from professional services decreased million  or  to million in from million in our professional services continue to represent a smaller portion of total revenues as our strategy has been to enable our customers to implement studies on their own or through cros  rather than incurring additional follow on costs 
this has contributed to lower professional services revenues compared with the prior year

research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs of million  which was attributable to our increase in staffing levels in order to support our strategy to continue to enhance and broaden our product offerings 
the increase was also attributable to a higher depreciation and amortization of million caused by higher capital expenditure spending 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to higher personnel related costs of million  as we expanded our sales team to support our continuing growth in sales 
the increase was also driven by higher travel costs of million incurred by members of our sales team as a result of increased domestic and international sales efforts 
additionally  we incurred higher overall marketing costs to support the launch of several new products and existing product upgrades in the remaining increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily attributable to higher recruiting costs and telecommunication expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs of million and technology related costs of million 
the increase in personnel related costs was primarily due to higher stock based compensation costs resulting from a full year impact from our equity awards granted in june  as well as the additional costs associated with our annual equity awards granted in may the increase also was attributable to higher staffing levels in order to manage our increased administrative workload and other additional costs incurred as a public company 
additionally  costs were impacted by a higher depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the purchase of certain technology equipment at the end of and increased costs associated with certain software licenses and maintenance renewals in the current year 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was also driven by a slight increase in professional fees  primarily due to higher legal fees incurred in association with certain of our litigation and indemnification obligation matters  as well as additional professional fees incurred as a result of being a public company since june  partially offset by the reduction of certain non recurring costs associated with our secondary offering in december income tax expense income tax expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to our ability to fully utilize our federal net operating loss carryforwards to offset federal taxable income as a result of the increased section limitation in our foreign income taxes were fairly consistent in as compared with year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues year ended december  change amount of revenues amount of revenues amount amount in thousands revenues application services professional services total revenues

the increase in revenues was also driven by new customer additions  increased product uptake and cross selling to existing customers 
in addition to maintaining a high customer retention rate  we benefited from providing full year of services for those customers who began their multi year arrangements during also  we were able to sell and implement several large multi year arrangements as well as make significant inroads into new midmarket customers during while the revenues from single study arrangements have continued to grow  the multi study arrangement revenue growth remained strong  increasing by versus a year ago 
revenues also expanded significantly from both domestic and international customers compared with the prior period 
revenues from customers based in north america grew  whereas revenues from customers based in europe and asia grew and  respectively 
finally  our acquisition of fast track contributed approximately million of our increase in revenues as we benefited from cross selling fast track products to our existing customers as well as recognized a full year of revenues in as compared with only nine and a half months in revenues from fast track are primarily generated from customers based in north america 
professional services revenues 
revenues from professional services increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in professional services revenues was attributable to higher demand for our services from new application services customers as well continued demand from existing customers driven by the increase in the number of studies performed by our customers

general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs of million which was primarily due to higher staffing levels as we expanded our corporate personnel in anticipation of becoming a public company  higher incentive compensation due to business performance  and higher stock based compensation costs as we granted new awards in association with completing our ipo 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was also attributable to million of costs associated with our secondary offering in december  million of accrual relating to our pending indemnification settlement and million of higher foreign exchange loss 

table of contents income tax expense income tax expense increased million  or  to million in from million in prior to  our income tax expense primarily consisted of foreign income taxes imposed on our foreign subsidiaries in the united kingdom and japan 
the increase was primarily due to domestic current income tax expense of million  offset by the recognition of a deferred income tax benefit of million and a slight reduction in foreign related taxes 
the domestic current income expense resulted from our inability to fully utilize our federal net operating loss carryforwards due to limitation under section  as well as the temporary suspension of net operating loss carryforward utilization in the state of california and income taxes incurred in other state and local jurisdictions 
in addition  we recognized a domestic deferred income tax benefit of million relating to our alternative minimum tax carryforwards  which are not currently subject to expiration dates and we believe are realizable 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity were cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at december  and million at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased million during primarily due to the net purchases of marketable securities and the funding of capital expenditures  partially offset by the cash generated from operations resulting from our higher net income 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents of million in in comparison with was primarily due to net proceeds from the ipo and cash receipts from higher sales activity  partially offset by the purchases of marketable securities  repayment of our term loan  the funding of capital expenditures and the payment of accumulated accrued dividends to our former preferred stockholders 
prior to completing the ipo in june  we funded our growth primarily through the private sale of equity securities  borrowings through various debt agreements  working capital and equipment leases 
in june  we completed our ipo  issuing million shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
as a result of the offering  we received net proceeds of million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and offering expenses of million 
we used a portion of our net proceeds to prepay the entire outstanding indebtedness of the term loan in july the remaining proceeds were held in cash and cash equivalents through september  and subsequently  a portion of such proceeds has been invested into high quality marketable securities 
as a result of the ipo  all outstanding convertible preferred stock was automatically converted into million shares of common stock 
in addition  we paid out all accumulated accrued dividends of million to preferred stockholders at conversion 
in december  we also completed a secondary offering in which certain selling stockholders sold a total of approximately million shares of our common stock 
we did not receive any proceeds but incurred approximately million of offering expenses in connection with this secondary offering 
such offering expenses were expensed as incurred 
we began to invest in marketable securities in october we manage our cash equivalents and marketable securities as a single investment portfolio that is intended to be available to meet our current cash requirements 
cash equivalents substantially consist of investments in money market funds 
marketable securities  which we classify as available for sale securities  primarily consist of high quality commercial paper  corporate bonds  us government debt obligations and bank certificates of deposit 
marketable securities with remaining effective maturities of twelve months or less from the balance sheet date are classified as short term  otherwise  they are classified as long term on the consolidated balance sheet 
prior to the repayment of our term loan  we had a senior secured credit facility  as subsequently amended  that included a million term loan and a million revolving line of credit 
the term loan was fully drawn at closing in september to repay all outstanding term notes in the total amount of million and the remaining million was used for general corporate purposes 
in july  we used a portion of our net proceeds from the ipo to prepay the entire outstanding indebtedness of the term loan 
the total payoff amount of million included the outstanding principal balance of million  as well as accrued interest and 
table of contents termination fees of million 
except for the million reduction of the available amount due to a standby letter of credit issued in connection with the office lease executed under our credit agreement in july  the revolving line of credit remains undrawn 
as of december   approximately million of the revolving line of credit was still available for future borrowings 
due to the structure of the credit agreement  any future borrowings under the revolving line of credit will be classified as a current liability 
as of december   the effective interest rate for our senior secured credit facility  as amended  was  if borrowing under the us london interbank offer rate  or libor  option 
we are in compliance with all covenants under our senior secured credit facility  as amended  as of december  see revolving line of credit section below for a summary of the second loan modification to our senior secured credit facility 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  existing cash and cash equivalents  highly liquid marketable securities and our existing revolving line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy the anticipated cash requirements associated with our existing operations for the foreseeable future 
in  we expect to make approximately to million in capital expenditures  primarily to enhance the stability and increase the capacity in our houston data center  as well as to enhance our computer equipment across various corporate functions 
we expect to acquire our capital equipment through purchases as opposed to capital lease arrangements 
our future capital expenditures and other cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors  including any expansion of our business that we may complete 
see risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k 
revolving line of credit in june  we entered into the second loan modification agreement with the lender to amend our existing senior secured credit facility 
pursuant to the terms of the second loan modification agreement  our senior secured credit facility was amended to reduce fees payable by us on our million revolving line of credit under the senior secured credit facility by a eliminating the margin on prime rate borrowings and b decreasing the undrawn revolving credit line fee from of the average undrawn balance to an annual rate of of the average undrawn balance  provide us with an option to borrow under the revolving line of credit at an interest rate based on the libor  plus a margin of  simplify our financial reporting procedures by eliminating monthly financial reporting obligations and amending certain reporting procedures  and replace our prior financial covenants with a simplified adjusted quick ratio covenant of as defined in the second loan modification agreement and provide that in the event that we have less than million of cash or cash equivalents in accounts with the lender in excess of our borrowings under the senior secured credit facility  we would also be required to satisfy a minimum trailing two quarter cash flow covenant  commencing at million for the period ended june  and increasing each quarter by million up to million for the quarter ending march  and thereafter 
cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities during were million  which consisted primarily of a net income of million  non cash adjustments of depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in deferred revenue of million  an decrease in accrued expenses of million and an increase in prepaid expenses of million 
the increase in accounts receivable was due to billing delays  which led to lower cash collections 
this resulted from our implementation of a new enterprise resource planning  or erp  system during the fourth quarter of we believe this increase in accounts receivable is temporary and over time we expect accounts receivable will decline back to our historical levels as we collect on the delayed invoices in the subsequent year 
the decrease in deferred revenue was primarily due to a decline in large upfront 
table of contents payments received from our customers  as some of our larger customers changed to more periodic payment terms upon their contract renewals 
this trend is consistent with our expectation as our saas business model continues to evolve 
the decrease in accrued expenses was primarily driven by certain accrued fees associated with our secondary offering and indemnification settlement were subsequently paid in finally  the increase in prepaid expenses related to the payments of certain multi year software related licenses and services we expect to utilize over the next two to three years 
cash flows provided by operating activities during were million  which consisted primarily of a net income of million  non cash adjustments of depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  an increase in accrued expenses of million and a decrease in deferred revenue of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable was due to strong customer collection activity 
the increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to higher incentive compensation associated with business performance as well as higher professional fees associated with our secondary offering and pending indemnification settlement 
the decrease in deferred revenue was primarily due to the timing of our customer billings and associated revenue recognition 
deferred revenue was also impacted by a million customer payment in the third quarter  provided in accordance with the underlying contractual agreement  made in advance of the full delivery of services required to begin revenue recognition 
cash flows provided by operating activities during were million  which consisted of net loss of million  offset by positive non cash adjustments to net loss of million and by a million increase in other operating activities

the significant increase in other operating activities includes the increase in deferred revenue of million and accrued expenses of million  partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable of million and the decrease in our accounts payable of million 
other operating activities were impacted by increased sales activity compared with the prior year and the timing of customer payments 
cash flows used in investing activities cash flows used in investing activities during were million  which was related to the million purchases of marketable securities and the million purchases of furniture  fixtures and equipment  partially offset by the million proceeds from sale and maturity of marketable securities 
for the year ended december   we did not acquire any equipment through capital lease arrangements

contractual obligations  commitments and contingencies the following table of our material contractual obligations as of december  summarizes the aggregate effect that these obligations are expected to have on our cash flows in the periods indicated in thousands payments due by period total year or less years years more than years contractual obligations operating lease obligations capital lease obligations letters of credit total in  one of our former employees made a claim seeking compensation of approximately million in relation to a wrongful dismissal lawsuit 
subsequently  the claim was reduced to approximately million as of december  the court rendered its decision in january  which awarded approximately million to the plaintiff 
the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal in september as of december   we had an accrual of approximately million associated with this claim 
this accrual was denominated in euros  the same currency as the claim  thus its balance was subject to foreign exchange fluctuations 
in december  we reached an agreement with the plaintiff and agreed to pay approximately million to fully settle this lawsuit and million associated with the related payroll tax obligation 
as a result  we recorded a gain of approximately million in the fourth quarter of the settlement amount was paid in december and the payroll tax obligation was subsequently paid in january in  it was claimed that certain applications offered to our customers potentially infringed on intellectual property rights held by a third party 
as a result of negotiations with the claimant  we entered into a license and settlement agreement in june  pursuant to which we licensed the intellectual property held by the claimant for use in our future sales to customers and settled all past infringement claims 
we paid a settlement amount of million to the claimant in in june  the claimant initiated a lawsuit against us claiming breach of contract 
the complaint includes allegations that we have failed to pay unspecified royalties relating to sales of our products 
we believe that the allegations in this lawsuit are without merit 
we filed an answer in july  denying all material allegations and asserting affirmative defenses 
we also asserted counterclaims for a declaratory judgment that no royalties are owed with respect to sales of our products  as well as a counterclaim for claimant s breach of the license and settlement agreement 
the parties are nearing completion of pre trial discovery activities 
a trial date has not yet been scheduled 
since the probable outcome and the future economic impact of this litigation on us remain uncertain  we are unable to develop an estimate of our potential liability  if any  as it relates to this litigation 
as a result  we did not record a liability as of december  the claimant also filed the patent infringement lawsuits against two of our customers as discussed below 

table of contents in  two customers requested us to indemnify them in connection with patent infringement lawsuits filed by the claimant who also filed a lawsuit against us in june as discussed above 
we agreed to defend and indemnify one of these customers with respect to the allegations  claims  and defenses relating to its use of our software 
as the estimated indemnification obligation concerning this claim was determined to be probable and could be reasonably estimated  we had accrued approximately million which was included in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  in march  we reached a final agreement with this customer and paid a settlement amount of million to fully settle this indemnification obligation 
to date  no claims have been asserted against the second customer with respect to its use of medidata s products 
in january  we entered into agreements with certain of our executive officers that provide them with certain benefits upon the termination of their employment following a change of control in our company 
the agreements provide that  upon a qualifying event  such officers will be entitled to a a severance payment equal to the officer s base salary plus target bonus amount b continuation of health benefits for months  c immediate vesting of any remaining unvested equity awards  and d a tax gross up payment under section g of the internal revenue code sufficient to reimburse the officer for of any excise tax payable as a result of any termination payments following a change in control  if applicable

we are currently in process of reviewing the patent and have not yet answered or otherwise responded to the complaint 
as a result  no accrual has been recorded associated with this complaint by us 
letters of credit we had several outstanding standby letters of credit as of december  and in the total amount of million 
these standby letters of credit were fully collateralized with our restricted cash and revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facility  as amended

effects of recently issued accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu no 
amends the current guidance on arrangements with multiple deliverables under asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  to a eliminate the separation criterion that requires entities to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for undelivered elements  b establish a selling price hierarchy to help entities allocate arrangement consideration to the separate units of account  c eliminate the residual allocation method which will be replaced by the relative selling price allocation method for all arrangements  and d significantly expand the disclosure requirements 
asu no 
is effective for new or materially modified arrangements in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we will adopt asu no 
prospectively on january  while we continue to evaluate the impact of the provisions of asu no 
on our consolidated financial statements  management believes that the revenue recognition of the professional services component included in our combined arrangements qualifies as a separate unit of accounting under asu no 
as a result  for any combined arrangements entered into or materially modified in  the professional services revenues will be recognized on a more accelerated or on an as delivered basis  as compared to our previous policy prior to the adoption of asu no 

table of contents in october  the fasb also issued asu no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
asu no 
amends the scoping guidance for software arrangements under asc  software revenue recognition  to exclude tangible products that contain software elements and nonsoftware elements that function together to interdependently deliver the product s essential functionality 
such tangible products being excluded from asu no 
will instead fall under the scope of asu no 
the fasb also provided several considerations and examples for entities applying this guidance 
the effective date for asu no 
is consistent with asu no 
as stated above 
we will adopt asu no 
prospectively and concurrently with asu no 
on january  and the adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 improving disclosure about fair value measurement 
asu amends asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  to add new requirements for disclosure about transfers into and out of levels and and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level measurements 
it also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
asu no 
is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level measurements  which are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we adopted asu no 
on january  and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 effect of denominating the exercise price of a share based payment award in the currency of the market in which the underlying equity security trades  which amends asc  compensation stock compensation  to clarify that a share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity s equity securities trades must not be considered a market  performance  or service condition 
therefore  an entity should not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies for classification in equity 
asu no 
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december   and will be applied prospectively 
we adopted asu no 
on january  all of our stock based awards granted to our international employees were classified as equity awards in accordance with our current accounting policy  which is consistent with the accounting treatment contained in asu no 
therefore  the adoption of this asu no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities of financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
other than our operating leases for office space and computer equipment  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million at december  our cash equivalents are invested in money market funds and certain commercial paper with maturities of less than three months at purchases  the fair value of which is not materially affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
we also had investment in marketable securities  which we classify as available for sale securities  totaling million at december  substantially all of our marketable securities are fixed income securities  which primarily consist of high quality commercial paper  corporate bonds  us government debt obligations  bank certificates of deposit and foreign government bonds 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as well as marketable securities are held for working capital purposes 
we manage our cash equivalents and marketable securities as a 
table of contents single investment portfolio that is intended to be available to meet our current cash requirements 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature and high credit ratings of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
we have a floating rate revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facility  as amended  which is currently undrawn 
accordingly  we will be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates if such revolving line of credit is drawn 
assuming the maximum available amount of our revolving line of credit was drawn as of december   each hundred basis point change in prime rate or libor would result in a change in interest expense by an average of approximately million annually 
exchange rate sensitivity we have two separate exposures to currency fluctuation risk subsidiaries outside the united states which use a foreign currency as their functional currency which are translated into us dollars for consolidation and non us dollar invoiced revenues 
changes in foreign exchange rates for our subsidiaries that use a foreign currency as their functional currency are translated into us dollars and result in cumulative translation adjustments  which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we had translation exposure to various foreign currencies  including the euro  british pound sterling and japanese yen 
the potential loss estimated for resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to million 
we generally invoice our customers in us dollars 
however  we invoice a portion of customers in foreign currencies  a majority of which is denominated in euro  swiss franc and canadian dollars 
as such  the fluctuations in such currencies could impact our operating results 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we might not be able to offset these higher costs fully through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
fair value of financial instruments asc  financial instruments  requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments 
the carrying amounts of our financial instruments  which consist of cash and cash equivalents  receivables  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
fair values of marketable securities are based on unadjusted quoted market prices or pricing models using current market data that are observable either directly or indirectly 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never actually be realized
