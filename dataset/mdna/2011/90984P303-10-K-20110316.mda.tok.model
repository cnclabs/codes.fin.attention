item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion is intended to provide insight into the financial condition and results of operations of united and its subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
operating loss and operating loss per diluted share are non gaap performance measures 
united s management believes that operating performance is useful in analyzing the company s financial performance trends since it excludes items that are non recurring in nature and therefore most of the discussion in this section will refer to operating performance measures 
a reconciliation of these operating performance measures to gaap performance measures is included in the table on pages and united s markets have been severely disrupted by the weak housing market which resulted in the buildup of surplus housing and finished lot inventory  which has put considerable stress on the residential construction portion of united s loan portfolio 
the weak economic conditions spread beyond the housing market  pushing unemployment to levels not seen in decades  which negatively impacted the rest of united s loan portfolio 
as a result  united reported a net loss of million in  which included non cash charges of million for goodwill impairment  a million partial fraud loss recovery  net of tax  as well as a million after tax loss from the transaction with fletcher  which is described on page this compared to a net loss of million in  which included non cash charges of million for goodwill impairment  a million charge for a reduction in workforce  net of tax  and an after tax gain of million for the acquisition of southern community bank scb 
united s net operating loss from continuing operations for was million  which excludes goodwill impairment and the partial fraud loss recovery  compared to a net operating loss from continuing operations of million for the twelve months ended december   which excludes goodwill impairment  severance costs and the gain on acquisition 
diluted operating loss from continuing operations per common share was for the year ended december   compared with a diluted operating loss per common share of for the goodwill impairment charge represented of loss per share 
in addition  the partial loss recovery resulted in a gain of 
per share bringing the total loss to per share 
in  the gain on acquisition  goodwill impairment charges and severance costs represented 
per share  per share and 
per share  respectively  for the year  bringing the diluted loss per share to 
the increased loss from reflected higher foreclosed property costs and the additional goodwill impairment charges 
united s approach to managing through the challenging economic cycle has been to aggressively deal with credit problems and dispose of troubled assets quickly  taking losses as necessary 
as a result  united s provision for loan losses was million in compared with million in net charge offs for were million compared with million in operating provision for loan losses and operating net charge offs for of million and million  respectively  excluded the partial recovery of million from a fraud loss incurred in related to two failed real estate developments in western north carolina 
at the end of  united s allowance for loan losses of million was of loans compared with million or of loans at the end of nonperforming assets of million  which excludes assets of scb that are covered by loss sharing agreements with the fdic  decreased to of total assets at december   compared to as of december  the sale of approximately million in nonperforming loans and million in foreclosed properties to fletcher in the second quarter of contributed to the decrease 
taxable equivalent net interest revenue was million for  compared to million for the same period in the decrease in net interest revenue was primarily due to lower levels of earning assets 
average loans and securities for declined million and million  respectively  from the year ended december  net interest margin improved basis points from in to in the margin improvement resulted from management s ongoing efforts to manage loan pricing  while lowering the cost of deposits 
operating fee revenue of million was down million or from the decrease was primarily attributable to balance sheet management activities that resulted in gains from the sale of securities of million in and million in offset by losses of million in on the prepayment of federal home loan bank advances 
mortgage loan and related fees decreased million compared to the prior year  due to the significant refinancing activity that took place in  as mortgage rates fell to historical lows 
in  united also recognized a gain of million related to the fdic assisted acquisition of scb which is not included in operating fee revenue 
the gain resulted from the bargain purchase since the purchase price was less than the value of the net assets and liabilities received 
for the year ended december   operating expenses of million  excluding the loss from the sale of nonperforming assets to fletcher  were up million  or from the same period in the prior year 
also excluded from operating expenses for was the million goodwill impairment charge 
operating expenses for excluded million in goodwill impairment charges and million in severance costs 
although united s expense saving initiatives were successful in lowering controllable expenses  foreclosed property costs were up million from higher foreclosed property expenses were partially offset by a million decrease in salaries and benefits expense  reflecting the staff reduction that began at the end of the first quarter of at the end of  united held million in commercial paper and short term investments as part of its continued emphasis on liquidity 
loans at december  were billion  down million from the end of  due to united s efforts to reduce exposure to residential construction loans 
totaling million  residential construction loans at december  represented of outstanding loans  down from at the end of  a decrease of million 
deposits were down million to billion  as united focused on reducing interest expense by allowing attrition in higher rate certificates of deposit by not aggressively competing with rates 
united s focus was to increase low cost core transaction deposits which grew million in at the end of  total equity capital was million  down million from december  reflecting the net loss of  offset by the million issuance of equity instruments to fletcher 
the loss includes a non cash charge of million for goodwill impairment  which reduced shareholders equity but had no impact on regulatory capital 
at december   all of united s regulatory capital ratios were above well capitalized levels 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of united and its subsidiaries are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the more critical accounting and reporting policies include united s accounting for the allowance for loan losses  fair value measurements  intangible assets and income taxes 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
these estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates or judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates or judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon future events 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record the valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies for united are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
management views critical accounting policies to be those that are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments  estimates and assumptions  and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on the financial statements 
management considers the following accounting policies to be critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on non impaired loans based on historical loss experience  management s evaluation of the current loan portfolio  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
loan losses are charged against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
the allowance for loan losses consists of an allocated component and an unallocated component 
the components of the allowance for loan losses represent an estimate 
the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses reflects expected losses resulting from analyses developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and historical loss experience for each loan category 
the specific credit allocations are based on regular analyses of all non accrual loans over  which are considered impaired loans 
these analyses involve judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans  including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values 
the historical loss element is determined using the weighted average of actual losses incurred over the prior eight quarters for each type of loan  updated quarterly 
the weighted average is weighted toward the most recent quarters loss experience 
the historical loss experience is adjusted for known changes in economic conditions and credit quality trends such as changes in the amount of past due and nonperforming loans 
the resulting loss allocation factors are applied to the balance of each type of loan after removing the balance of impaired loans and other specifically allocated loans from each category 
the loss allocation factors are updated annually 
the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses also includes consideration of concentrations of credit and changes in portfolio mix 
the unallocated portion of the allowance reflects management s estimate of probable inherent but undetectable losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate to subsequent loss rates  and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
in addition  the unallocated allowance includes a component that accounts for the inherent imprecision in loan loss estimation based on historical loss experience as a result of united s growth through acquisitions  which have expanded the geographic footprint in which it operates  and changed its portfolio mix in recent years 
also  loss data representing a complete economic cycle is not available for all sectors 
uncertainty surrounding the strength and timing of economic cycles also affects estimates of loss 
the historical losses used in developing loss allocation factors may not be representative of actual unrealized losses inherent in the portfolio 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its processes for determining the allowance adequately consider all the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
additional information on united s loan portfolio and allowance for loan losses can be found in the sections of management s discussion and analysis titled asset quality and risk elements and nonperforming assets and in the sections of part i  item titled lending policy and loan review and nonperforming assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes additional information on united s accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses 
fair value measurements united s impaired loans and foreclosed assets may be measured and carried at fair value  the determination of which requires management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments 
at december   the percentage of total assets measured at fair value was 
see note fair value in the consolidated financial statements herein for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
when a loan is considered impaired  a specific valuation allowance is allocated  if necessary  so that the loan is reported net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
in addition  foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less cost to sell  following foreclosure 
fair value is defined by gaap as the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
gaap further defines an orderly transaction as a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets it is not a forced transaction for example  a forced liquidation or distress sale 
recently in the bank s markets there have been very few transactions in the type of assets which represent the vast majority of the bank s impaired loans and foreclosed properties which reflect orderly transactions as so defined 
instead  most transactions in comparable assets have been distressed sales not indicative of fair value 
accordingly  the determination of fair value in the current environment is difficult and more subjective than it would be in a stable real estate environment 
although management believes its processes for determining the value of these assets are appropriate factors and allow united to arrive at a fair value  the processes require management judgment and assumptions and the value of such assets at the time they are revalued or divested may be significantly different from management s determination of fair value 
in addition  because of this increased subjectivity in fair value determinations  there is greater than usual grounds for differences in opinions  which may result in increased disagreements between management and the bank s regulators  disagreements which could impair the relationship between the bank and its regulators 
intangible assets united s intangible assets have historically consisted of goodwill  representing the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses  and core deposit intangibles 
united s goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more often if events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist 
adverse changes in the economic environment  declining operations of acquired business units  or other factors could result in a decline of the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value is less than the carrying amount  a loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill 
these changes or factors  if they occur  could be material to united s operating results for any particular reporting period  the potential effect cannot be reasonably estimated 
during the third quarter of  united conducted an interim goodwill impairment assessment as a result of a significant decline in its stock price 
the impairment assessment results indicated that united s goodwill was completely impaired and the remaining balance of million was charged to earnings during the third quarter 
the third quarter impairment charge followed two other impairment charges in the first and third quarters of of million and million  respectively 
other identifiable intangible assets  primarily core deposit intangibles  are reviewed at least annually for events or circumstances which could affect the recoverability of the intangible asset  such as loss of core deposits  increased competition or adverse changes in the economy 
to the extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable  an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the intangible assets 
these events or circumstances  if they occur  could be material to united s operating results for any particular reporting period  the potential effect cannot be reasonably estimated 
income tax accounting income tax liabilities or assets are established for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are also established for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and deductions that can be carried forward used in future years 
the valuation of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is considered critical as it requires management to make estimates based on provisions of the enacted tax laws 
the assessment of tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates  assumptions  interpretations  and judgments concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes 
there can be no assurance that future events  such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities  will not differ from management s current assessment  the impact of which could be significant to the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings 
united believes its tax assets and liabilities are properly recorded for the respective periods in the consolidated financial statements 
at december   united had net deferred tax assets of million  including a valuation allowance of million related to state tax credits that are expected to expire unused 
accounting standards codification topic  income taxes  requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
united s management considers both positive and negative evidence and analyzes changes in near term market conditions as well as other factors which may impact future operating results 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
at december   united s management believes that it is more likely than not that  with the exception of those state tax credits that are expected to expire unused due to a relatively short carryforward period of three years  it will be able to realize its deferred tax benefits through its ability to carry losses forward to future profitable years 
despite recent losses and the challenging economic environment  united has a history of strong earnings  is well capitalized  and has cautiously optimistic expectations regarding future taxable income 
the deferred tax assets are analyzed quarterly for changes affecting their ability to be realized  and there can be no guarantee that a valuation allowance will not be necessary in future periods 
regulatory risk based capital rules limit the amount of deferred tax assets that a bank or bank holding company can include in tier capital 
generally  deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of i the amount of such deferred tax assets that the bank expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter end date  based on its projected future taxable income for that year or ii of the amount of the bank s tier capital 
in united had fully utilized its ability to carry losses back to open tax years 
therefore united s realization of its deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income 
accordingly  united has excluded the entire balance of its net deferred tax asset from tier capital in calculating its risk based capital ratios 
in february of  the american recovery and reinvestment act amended the internal revenue code to allow eligible small businesses to carry back net operating losses nol s for a period of three  four or five years  instead of the usual two year limit 
in november of  the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act expanded this treatment to include nol s incurred in and allowed all businesses  not just eligible small businesses  to make the election 
however the election was not available to participants in the us treasury s capital purchase program  therefore united was not able to utilize this treatment 
mergers and acquisitions united selectively engages in the evaluation of strategic partnerships 
mergers and acquisitions present opportunities to enter new markets with an established presence and a capable management team already in place 
united employs certain criteria to ensure that any merger or acquisition candidate meets strategic growth and earnings objectives that will build future franchise value for shareholders 
additionally  the criteria include ensuring that management of a potential partner shares united s community banking philosophy of premium service quality and operates in attractive markets with excellent opportunities for further organic growth 
as part of this strategy  united completed one federally assisted acquisition in united will continue to evaluate potential transactions as they are presented  including acquisitions of failed banks to the extent we are permitted to bid on them 
on june   ucb purchased substantially all the assets and assumed substantially all the liabilities of southern community bank scb from the federal deposit insurance corporation as receiver of scb 
scb operated five commercial banking branches on the south side of atlanta in fayetteville  peachtree city  locust grove and newnan  georgia 
the fdic took scb under receivership upon scb s closure by the georgia department of banking and finance at the close of business on june  the transaction resulted in a cash payment of million from the fdic to ucb 
further  ucb and the fdic entered into loss sharing agreements regarding future losses incurred on loans and foreclosed loan collateral existing at june  under the terms of the loss sharing agreements  the fdic will absorb percent of losses and share percent of loss recoveries on the first million of losses  and absorb percent of losses and share in percent of loss recoveries exceeding million 
the term for loss sharing on to family loans is ten years  while the term for loss sharing on all other loans is five years 
as a result of the acquisition  united recorded a gain totaling million as a component of fee revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
the amount of gain is equal to the amount by which the fair value of the assets purchased exceeded the fair value of liabilities assumed 
the results of operations of scb are included in the consolidated statement of operations from the acquisition date of june  gaap reconciliation and explanation this form k contains non gaap financial measures determined by methods other than in accordance with gaap 
such non gaap financial measures include  among others  the following operating revenue  operating expense  operating loss income  operating earnings loss per share and operating earnings loss per diluted share 
management uses these non gaap financial measures because it believes it is useful for evaluating our operations and performance over periods of time  as well as in managing and evaluating our business and in discussions about our operations and performance 
management believes these non gaap financial measures provide users of our financial information with a meaningful measure for assessing our financial results and credit trends  as well as comparison to financial results for prior periods 
these non gaap financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled financial measures used by other companies 
a reconciliation of these operating performance measures to gaap performance measures is included on the tables on pages and in  united recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million in the third quarter 
also in  united received a partial recovery of million  net of recovery costs  in the fourth quarter resulting from fraud losses incurred in relating to two failed real estate developments near spruce pine  north carolina 
in  united recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges of million and million during the third and first quarters  respectively 
in addition  united recorded severance costs of million during the first quarter of and a gain on the acquisition of scb in the amount of million during the second quarter of net operating income loss excludes the effect of the goodwill impairment charge of million and the million fraud loss partial recovery in and the goodwill impairment charges of million  the million gain on acquisition  and the million in severance costs in  because management believes that the circumstances leading to those items were isolated  non recurring events and do not reflect overall trends in united s earnings and financial performance 
management believes this non gaap net operating income loss provides users of united s financial information with a meaningful measure for assessing united s financial results and credit trends  as well as comparison to financial results for prior periods

as a result  the operations of brintech are being accounted for as a discontinued operation 
all revenue  including the gain from the sale  expenses and income taxes relating to brintech have been deconsolidated from the consolidated statement of operations and are presented on one line titled loss income from discontinued operations for all periods presented 
because brintech s assets  liabilities and cash flows were not material to the consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows  no such adjustments have been made to those financial statements 
transaction with fletcher international the current banking environment  particularly within the southeast and united s footprint  has left many financial institutions with a surplus of foreclosed real estate and nonperforming loans  particularly residential construction 
disposing of these nonperforming assets has become increasingly challenging in this environment as those involved in the business of buying  developing and selling real estate the typical purchasers of foreclosed properties have themselves been negatively impacted by the housing market and therefore lack the ability to purchase surplus real estate 
the build up of residential construction inventory and lack of buyers  especially in the non atlanta markets  has created an imbalance between supply and demand that has sent prices spiraling downward 
as a result  most dispositions of problem assets have occurred only by pricing properties at substantial discounts and incurring significant losses which results in a reduction of capital 
the challenge in this environment is to find ways to sell a large quantity of nonperforming assets without significantly reducing capital 
the transaction with fletcher international inc fletcher inc and fletcher international ltd fletcher ltd  together with fletcher inc and their affiliates  fletcher accomplished that objective by combining the sale of nonperforming assets with the issuance of equity instruments 
although the transaction with fletcher is described in more detail below  in essence  fletcher agreed to acquire certain of united s more illiquid nonperforming assets and received equity instruments that include a warrant to purchase common stock and the right to purchase convertible preferred stock with an additional warrant to purchase common stock 
all of the assets and equity instruments transferred in the transaction were transferred at fair value  which resulted in the recognition of a loss in the consolidated financial statements 
the transaction had a slight positive impact on total capital  since the equity instruments exchanged in the transaction increased shareholders equity which more than offset the after tax loss on the transaction 
description of transaction on april   the bank entered into an asset purchase and sale agreement the asset purchase agreement with fletcher inc and five affiliated limited liability companies llcs formed by fletcher inc for the purpose of acquiring nonperforming assets under the asset purchase agreement 
united has no ownership interest in the llcs 
the asset sale transaction was completed on april  with the bank transferring nonperforming commercial and residential construction loans and foreclosed properties having a carrying value of million in exchange for cash of million and notes receivable for million 
the loans accrue interest at a fixed rate of and mature in five years 
principal and interest payments will be made quarterly based on a year amortization schedule 
fletcher inc also contributed cash and securities to the llcs equal to of the purchase price to pre fund the estimated carrying costs of the assets for approximately three years 
these funds are held in escrow as additional collateral on the loans and cannot be removed by fletcher without united s consent 
the securities that can be held by the llcs are marketable equity securities and funds managed by fletcher affiliates 
carrying costs include debt service payments  servicing fees and other direct costs associated with holding and managing the underlying properties 
also on april   united and fletcher ltd 
entered into a securities purchase agreement the securities purchase agreement pursuant to which fletcher ltd 
agreed to purchase from united  and united agreed to issue and sell to fletcher ltd   shares of united s series c convertible preferred stock  par value per share the convertible preferred stock  at a purchase price of  per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the convertible preferred stock will bear interest at an annual rate equal to the lesser of or libor 
if all conditions precedent to fletcher ltd 
s obligations to purchase the convertible preferred stock have been satisfied and fletcher ltd 
has not purchased all of the convertible preferred stock by may   it must pay united of the commitment amount not purchased by that date  and it must also pay united an additional of any commitment amount not purchased by may the convertible preferred stock is redeemable by fletcher ltd 
at any time into common stock or non voting common stock equivalent junior preferred stock junior preferred stock of united  at an equivalent price of per share of common stock equal to  shares of common stock  subject to certain adjustments 
after may   if the closing stock price for united s common stock is above  united has the right to require conversion and it is united s intent to convert all of the then outstanding convertible preferred stock into an equivalent amount of common stock or junior preferred stock 
the securities purchase agreement provides that united shall not effect any conversion or redemption of the convertible preferred stock  and fletcher ltd 
shall not have the right to convert or redeem any portion of the convertible preferred stock  into common stock to the extent such conversion or redemption would result in aggregate issuances to fletcher ltd 
in excess of of the number of shares of common stock that would be outstanding after giving effect to such conversion or redemption 
in the event that united cannot effect a conversion or redemption of the convertible preferred stock into common stock due to this limit  the conversion or redemption shall be effected into an equal number of shares of junior preferred stock 
concurrently with the payment of the million deposit under the asset purchase agreement by fletcher  united granted a warrant to fletcher to purchase junior preferred stock 
the warrant was initially equal to million and was increased to million upon the completion of the asset sale pursuant to the asset purchase agreement 
an additional million warrant will be issued on a dollar for dollar basis by the aggregate dollar amount of the convertible preferred stock purchased under the securities purchase agreement in excess of million 
the million warrant price is equivalent to per common share cash exercise equal to  shares of common stock 
the million warrant price is equivalent to per common share cash exercise equal to  shares of common stock 
the warrants may only be exercised by net share settlement cashless exercise and are exercisable for nine years from april   subject to limited extension upon certain events specified in the warrant agreement 
all of the warrants settle on a cashless basis and the net shares to be issued to fletcher ltd 
upon exercise of the warrants will be less than the total shares that would have been issuable if the warrants had been exercised for cash payments 
also  as part of the transaction  united and fletcher entered into a servicing agreement whereby united will act as servicer of the nonperforming assets for fletcher in exchange for a servicing fee of basis points 
the llcs will pay all direct costs associated with the nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties 
because the servicing arrangement is considered a normal servicing arrangement and the fee is appropriate for the services provided  united did not recognize a servicing asset or liability related to the servicing agreement 
also as part of the servicing agreement  fletcher maintains decision making authority with regard to the nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties except for minor  routine matters 
accounting treatment although the asset purchase agreement and the securities purchase agreement are two separate agreements  they were accounted for as part of one transaction because they were entered into simultaneously and the securities purchase agreement was dependent upon the sale of nonperforming assets 
united evaluated this transaction to determine whether the transfer should be accounted for as a sale or a secured borrowing and whether the fletcher llcs should be consolidated with united 
when evaluating whether the transfer should be accounted for as a sale  united primarily evaluated whether control had been surrendered  the rights of fletcher to exchange and pledge the assets  and whether united retains effective control  which included evaluating any continuing involvement in the assets 
based on the evaluation  the transfer of assets under the asset purchase agreement meets the definition as a sale under current accounting standards and was accounted for as such 
united further evaluated whether the fletcher llcs should be consolidated which included evaluating whether united has a controlling financial interest and is therefore the primary beneficiary 
this evaluation principally included determining whether united directs the activities that have the most significant impact on the llcs economic performance and whether united has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the llcs 
based on that evaluation  the llcs have not been included as part of the consolidated group of subsidiaries in united s consolidated financial statements 
in addition to evaluating the accounting for the transfer of assets  united considered whether the warrant and the option to purchase convertible preferred stock with an additional warrant should be accounted for as liabilities or equity instruments 
in making this evaluation  united considered whether fletcher or any subsequent holders of the instruments could require settlement of the instruments in cash or other assets rather than common or preferred stock 
because the transaction was structured so that the warrants and option to purchase convertible preferred stock and the additional warrant can only be settled through the issuance of common or preferred stock  united concluded that the warrant and option to purchase convertible preferred stock with an additional warrant should be accounted for as equity instruments 
all of the components of the transaction  including all equity instruments issued under the securities purchase agreement and the notes receivable received as consideration from the sale of nonperforming assets were recorded at fair value 
because the value of the equity instruments and assets exchanged in the transaction exceeded the value of the cash and notes receivable received  united recorded a loss of million on the transaction with fletcher

the following modeling assumptions were used dividend yield  risk free interest rate  current stock price  term years  and volatility 
although most of the modeling assumptions were based on observable data  because of the subjectivity involved in estimating expected volatility  the valuation is considered level the million value of the option to purchase convertible preferred stock and warrant was determined by an independent valuation firm using a monte carlo simulation method appropriate for valuing complex securities with derivatives 
the model uses  simulations of daily stock price paths using geometric brownian motion and incorporates in a unified way all conversion  exercise and contingency conditions 
because of the significant assumptions involved in the valuation process  not all of which were based on observable data  the valuation is considered to be level the million of nonperforming assets sold were transferred at united s carrying value which had been written down to appraised value 
because the appraisals were based on sales of similar assets observable data  the valuation is considered to be level the million of notes receivable were recorded at their estimated fair value of million  net of a million interest discount  which was determined based on discounted expected cash flows over the term at a rate commensurate with the credit risk inherent in the notes 
the contractual rate on the notes is fixed at for five years 
the discount rate used for purposes of determining the fair value of the notes was based on the terms  structure and risk profile of the notes 
note prepayments were estimated based on the expected marketing times for the underlying collateral since the notes require that principal be reduced as the underlying assets are sold 
the valuation is considered level due to estimated prepayments which have a significant impact on the value and are not based on observable data 
results of operations the remainder of this financial discussion focuses on operating earnings  which excludes the goodwill impairment charge and partial fraud loss recovery in  the goodwill impairment charges  gain on acquisition and severance costs in  and the fraud related provision in  except for the discussion of income taxes 
operating and gaap earnings were the same in and for additional information on operating earnings measures  refer to the preceding section on non gaap financial measures 
united reported a net operating loss from continuing operations of million for the twelve months ended december   which included the million after tax loss related to the fletcher transaction and excluded the million goodwill impairment charge as well as the partial fraud loss recovery of million  after tax 
this compared to a net operating loss from continuing operations of million for the same period in  which excluded the million gain on acquisition  net of tax  non cash goodwill impairment charges of million  and non recurring severance costs of million

net interest revenue taxable equivalent net interest revenue the difference between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and other liabilities is the single largest component of united s revenue 
united actively manages this revenue source to provide optimal levels of revenue while balancing interest rate  credit  and liquidity risks 
taxable equivalent net interest revenue totaled million in  a decrease of million  or less than  from the level recorded in taxable equivalent net interest revenue for increased million  or  from the level 
the decrease in net interest revenue for compared to was due primarily to lower levels of interest earning assets 
united continued its focus on loan and deposit pricing  in an effort to maintain a steady level of net interest revenue  despite continuing attrition in the loan portfolio and few attractive investment opportunities in the securities portfolio 
the average yield on loans decreased basis points reflecting the continuing effect of the low interest rate environment and the higher level of nonperforming loans 
average loans decreased million in  or  from the decrease in the loan portfolio was throughout united s footprint and was a result of the slowdown in the housing market 
at december   period end loan balances in the atlanta msa  north georgia  coastal georgia  the gainesville msa and western north carolina  were down million  million  million  million and million  respectively  compared to december  loan charge offs  foreclosure activity and management s efforts to rebalance the loan portfolio by reducing the concentration of residential construction loans have all contributed to declining loan balances 
while loan balances have declined  united continues to make new loans 
during  united made million in new loans  excluding loans made to fletcher international to finance the sale of nonperforming assets in the second quarter of  primarily commercial and small business loans in the atlanta msa and north georgia 
average interest earning assets for the year decreased million  or  from decreases of million in average loans and million in the investment securities portfolio were partially offset by a million increase in other interest earning assets 
loan demand has been weak due to the poor economy and management s efforts to reduce united s exposure to residential construction loans 
the increase in other interest earning assets was due to purchases of short term commercial paper and bank certificates of deposit  in an effort to invest funds raised through deposit gathering activities while maintaining higher than normal levels of liquidity 
average interest bearing liabilities in decreased million  or  from the prior year due to the rolling off of higher cost certificates of deposit and the maturity prepayment of federal home loan bank advances  as funding needs decreased 
the average yield on interest earning assets for was down basis points from in  primarily due to lower interest rates on united s loans and investments and the shift in interest earning asset mix to low yielding short term commercial paper 
partially offsetting the trend of higher nonperforming loan levels  the transaction with fletcher in the second quarter of  replaced approximately million of nonperforming loans from united s portfolio with a performing loan to fletcher 
the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the year ended december   was compared to for the same period in  reflecting united s concerted efforts to reduce deposit pricing 
also contributing to the overall lower rate on interest bearing liabilities was a shift in the mix of deposits away from more expensive time deposits toward lower rate transaction deposits 
united s shrinking balance sheet also permitted the reduction of more expensive wholesale borrowings 
the banking industry uses two key ratios to measure relative profitability of net interest revenue the net interest spread and the net interest margin 
the net interest spread measures the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread eliminates the effect of non interest bearing deposits and other non interest bearing funding sources and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
the net interest margin is an indication of the profitability of a company s overall balance sheet management activities and is defined as net interest revenue as a percentage of total average interest earning assets  which includes the positive effect of funding a portion of interest earning assets with customers non interest bearing deposits and with shareholders equity 
for  and  united s net interest spread was   and  respectively  while the net interest margin was   and  respectively 
the improving net interest margin reflected management s efforts to maximize earnings by focusing on loan and deposit pricing 
united intensified its focus on loan pricing to ensure it was being adequately compensated for the credit risk it was taking 
both the net interest margin and net interest spread expanded in and after falling in the decline in both measures was due to aggressive competitive pricing for deposits as banks  including united  struggled to build and maintain liquidity 
also contributing to the decline were the impacts of the prime interest rate decreasing basis points throughout the year on united s asset sensitive balance sheet and the higher levels of nonperforming assets 
competition for liquidity via deposits kept retail certificate of deposit rates relatively high while short term market rates were falling 
competition for liquidity sources eased in the fourth quarter of allowing united the ability to reduce deposit pricing while maintaining sufficient liquidity 
this trend continued through  allowing united to maintain higher than normal levels of liquidity while continuing to improve the net interest margin 
the combined effect of lower deposit pricing and wider credit spreads and floors on loans resulted in a basis point increase in the net interest margin from to and an basis point increase from to the following table shows the relationship between interest revenue and interest expense and the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of losses inherent in the loan portfolio and corresponding analysis of the allowance for loan losses at quarter end 
the operating provision for loan losses was million in  compared with million in  and million in the operating provision is million higher than the gaap provision for loan losses which includes the partial recovery of the fraud loss provision recorded in as an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans  the operating provision was  and  respectively  in  and the amount of provision recorded in each year was the amount required such that the total allowance for loan losses reflected  in the estimation of management  the appropriate balance  and was appropriate to cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
in  the level of the allowance leveled off as charge off levels began to decline from the high level in this resulted in a lower operating provision for loan losses in than while nonperforming assets remained well above historical levels throughout reflecting the ongoing weakness in the economy in general and the weak housing market in particular  improving trends began to emerge with net charge offs and nonperforming assets both falling below the level in the operating ratio of net loan charge offs to average outstanding loans for was  excluding the million partial recovery  compared with for  and for as the residential construction and housing markets have struggled  it has been difficult for many builders and developers to obtain cash flow from selling lots and houses needed to service debt 
this deterioration of the residential construction and housing market was the primary factor that resulted in higher credit losses and an increase in nonperforming assets over the last two years 
although a majority of the loan charge offs have been within the residential construction and development portion of the portfolio  credit quality deterioration has migrated to other loan categories as unemployment levels have remained high throughout united s markets 
additional discussion on credit quality and the allowance for loan losses is included in the asset quality and risk elements and critical accounting polices sections of this report  as well as note to the consolidated financial statements 
fee revenue operating fee revenue from continuing operations was million in  compared with million in and million in operating fee revenue excludes the million bargain purchase gain from the acquisition of scb in including the gain on acquisition in  fee revenue from continuing operations was million for the year ended december  fee revenue from continuing operations excludes consulting fees earned by united s brintech subsidiary which was sold on march  all periods are presented on a continuing operations basis 
the following table presents the components of fee revenue 
table fee revenue from continuing operations for the years ended december  in thousands change service charges and fees mortgage loan and related fees brokerage fees securities gains  net losses on prepayment of borrowings other total fee revenue before gain from acquisition gain from acquisition total fee revenue service charges and fees of million were down  or  from the decrease was primarily due to lower overdraft fees resulting from decreased utilization of our courtesy overdraft services 
overdraft fees fell in the third and fourth quarters of with the recent changes to regulation e  requiring customers to opt in to such services 
overdraft and non sufficient funds charges decreased million from this decrease was partially offset by an increase in atm and debit card fees of million from mortgage loan and related fees of million were down million  or  from in  refinancing activity reached record levels due to historically low mortgage interest rates 
in  united closed  mortgage loans totaling million compared with  loans totaling million in substantially all these originated residential mortgages were sold into the secondary market  including the right to service the loans 
brokerage fees of million increased  or  from the increase in brokerage fees was due to improving market conditions from those in additionally  a portion of united s brokerage fee revenue is derived from the value of assets under management which increased with the overall improvement in the market  further contributing to the increased revenue 
united incurred net securities gains of million and million during and  respectively 
the net gain included  in impairment charges in the first quarter of  on trust preferred securities of a bank whose financial condition had deteriorated 
the impairment charges were more than offset by gains from securities sales 
in  the net securities gains were also offset by losses resulting from the prepayment of fhlb advances  which were part of the same balance sheet management activities 
the net securities gains in included million in impairment charges on equity and trust preferred securities investments in banks that failed during the year 
in  united sold mortgage backed securities in an effort to reposition the securities portfolio in anticipation of rising interest rates 
the proceeds from the sales were reinvested in us government agency bonds to avoid extension risk when interest rates rise 
other fee revenue of million increased million  or  from the increase was primarily due to ineffectiveness of united s cash flow and fair value hedges 
during  united recognized million in income from hedge ineffectiveness compared with  in most of the hedge ineffectiveness in was due to the acceleration of deferred gains from terminated cash flow hedging positions due to missed forecasted transactions 
the million gain from the scb acquisition in was accounted for as a bargain purchase 
in this bargain purchase  the fair values of the net assets and liabilities received from the acquisition exceeded the purchase price of those assets and liabilities 
with the scb acquisition  united received assets  including a cash payment from the fdic  with an estimated fair value of million and liabilities with an estimated fair value of million 
the difference between the fair values of the assets received and liabilities assumed of million was recorded as a gain from the acquisition 
operating expense the following table presents the components of operating expenses 
this table is presented to reflect brintech as a discontinued operation  and accordingly  operating expenses associated with brintech have been excluded from the table for all periods presented 
table operating expenses from continuing operations for the years ended december  in thousands change salaries and employee benefits communications and equipment occupancy advertising and public relations postage  printing and supplies professional fees foreclosed property foreclosure and carrying costs foreclosed property writedowns and losses from sales fdic assessments and other regulatory charges amortization of intangibles other loss on sale of nonperforming assets operating expenses  before nonrecurring items goodwill impairment charges severance cost total operating expenses operating expenses excluding non operating items and the loss from the sale of nonperforming assets to fletcher international were million in as compared to million in and million in non recurring charges in include million for goodwill impairment 
non recurring charges in include million for goodwill impairment and million in severance costs relating to a reduction in force 
the million loss on the sale of nonperforming assets to fletcher was incurred during the second quarter of although the loss from the bulk sale of nonperforming assets resulted from an isolated event  because disposition of nonperforming assets is considered an operating activity  it is not excluded from operating expenses as a non recurring item  but has been separated to make trend comparisons more meaningful 
including the loss on sale of nonperforming assets and those non recurring charges  operating expenses for and were million and million  respectively 
salaries and employee benefits expense for was million  a decrease of million  or  from the decrease was due to a number of factors including lower equity compensation expense as united did not grant annual equity compensation awards in and lower salaries and benefits resulting from a decrease in headcount 
headcount totaled  at december  compared to  at december   which excludes employees of brintech  inc although headcount at the end of was nearly identical to the end of  united began with  employees  excluding employees of brintech  prior to the reduction in force  most of which occurred in the first quarter of communication and equipment expense for was million  which was down  or  from united was able to keep expenses flat despite the additional expenses associated with the acquisition of scb in due to upgrades in technology in previous years 
advertising and public relations expense for was million  an increase of  or  from the increase was primarily related to advertising campaigns and promotions aimed at increasing core transaction deposits through united s strong bank  strong service and number one in customer satisfaction marketing initiatives  which have been successful in adding million in core transaction deposits in the past twelve months 
postage  printing and supplies expense for was million  a decrease of  or  from much of the decrease was due to lower courier expense due to the use of remote deposit capture technology in branch locations to eliminate the need to courier items to be processed between branch locations and item processing centers 
united also continues to promote the use of electronic statements which has resulted in decreasing postage charges 
professional fees were million for  a decrease of million  or  from during the first quarter of  united was engaged in a project to improve operational efficiency and to reduce operating expenses 
consulting services related to that project were performed by brintech  a wholly owned subsidiary at the time 
since the table above is presented with brintech as a discontinued operation  the fees charged by brintech for those services are no longer eliminated in this table and our consolidated statement of operations and are therefore reflected in professional fees for the year ended december  lower legal fees in for credit related work also contributed to the decrease in professional fees 
total foreclosed property expense for was million  an increase of million from foreclosed property expenses have remained elevated throughout the weak economic cycle 
the foreclosure and carrying costs category includes legal fees  property taxes  marketing costs  utility services  maintenance and repair charges  while the write downs and losses from sales includes realized losses and write downs resulting from decreases in property values 
realized losses and write downs totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for expenses related to foreclosed properties have risen with the increase in the number of foreclosed properties 
fdic assessments and other regulatory charges expense for was million  a decrease of million from  reflecting a million special assessment charged to all depository institutions in absent the one time assessment in  fdic premiums increased in due to an increase in united s assessment rate 
in the fourth quarter of  the fdic announced that banks were required to prepay deposit insurance premiums for the years through while this resulted in a million premium cash outlay in the fourth quarter of  the expense is recognized ratably over the three year period in the consolidated statement of operations 
other expenses totaled million for  an increase of million  or  from  primarily due to an increase in appraisals and collection costs as well as short sale losses 
also contributing to the increase was the reversal of a million accrual in the second quarter of  related to a disputed charge from the transfer of boli investments 
the disputed charge was settled in united s favor during the second quarter of  and reduced other expenses for that period 
income taxes income tax benefit from continuing operations was million in  compared to income tax benefits of million and million in and  respectively 
the effective tax rates as a percentage of pre tax net income were   and for  and  respectively 
excluding the goodwill impairment charges in and  which had a very limited tax impact  the effective tax rates for those periods were and  respectively 
the effective tax rates were different from the statutory tax rates primarily due to interest revenue on certain investment securities and loans that are exempt from income taxes  tax exempt fee revenue  tax credits received on affordable housing investments  goodwill impairment charges and the change in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as discussed below 
the effective tax rate for reflects the tax treatment of the loss on the sale of nonperforming assets to fletcher and an increase in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to state tax credits with short carryforward periods that are expected to expire unused 
the effective tax rate for reflects a decision made by management to reinstate certain boli policies which united had surrendered in the third quarter of united notified the carrier of its intent to surrender the policies in the fourth quarter of due to a dispute with the carrier 
the policies required a six month waiting period before the surrender became effective 
prior to the expiration of the six month waiting period  united and the carrier were able to reach an acceptable settlement of the dispute and the surrender transaction was terminated 
the tax charge recorded in was reversed during the second quarter of the effective tax rates for and also reflect the tax treatment of the goodwill impairment charges totaling million and million  respectively 
since the majority of united s goodwill originated from acquisitions that were treated as tax free exchanges  a very small amount of goodwill was recognized for tax reporting purposes  and therefore the resulting tax benefit for the impairment charges was minimal 
likewise  no tax benefit was recognized in the financial statements relating to the goodwill impairment charges 
the effective tax rates for and also reflect valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets 
at december  and  management determined that it was more likely than not that approximately million and million  net of federal benefit  of state low income housing and business tax credits will expire unused due to a relatively short three and five year carry forward periods  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  united resolved a tax dispute with a state taxing authority relative to an issue identified during a routine audit 
united had fully reserved for the issue as an uncertain tax position 
the resolution resulted in the release of the reserve which increased the fourth quarter tax benefit by approximately million 
absent the goodwill impairment charges  the tax treatment of the loss on sale of nonperforming assets and adjustments to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  united s effective tax rate for the year ended december  would have been approximately 
absent the goodwill impairment charges  the boli transactions  the settlement of the uncertain tax position and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  united s effective tax rate for the year ended december   would have been approximately 
at december   united had net deferred tax assets of million  including a valuation allowance of million related to state tax credits that are expected to expire unused 
accounting standards codification topic  income taxes  requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
united s management considers both positive and negative evidence and analyzes changes in near term market conditions as well as other factors which may impact future operating results 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
at december   united s management believes that it is more likely than not that  with the exception of the state tax credits that are expected to expire unused due to relatively short carry forward periods of three to five years  it will be able to realize its deferred tax benefits through its ability to carry losses forward to future profitable years 
despite recent losses and the challenging economic environment  united has a history of strong earnings  is well capitalized  continues to grow its core customer deposit base while maintaining very high customer satisfaction scores  and has cautiously optimistic expectations regarding future taxable income 
the deferred tax assets are analyzed quarterly for changes affecting realizabilty 
united s most recent analysis  which management believes is based on conservative assumptions  indicated that the deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards will be fully utilized well in advance of the twenty year carryforward period allowed for net operating losses  however there can be no guarantee that a valuation allowance will not be necessary in future periods 
additional information regarding income taxes  including a reconciliation of the differences between the recorded income tax provision and the amount of income tax computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fourth quarter discussion taxable equivalent net interest revenue for the fourth quarter of decreased million  or  to million from the same period a year ago  primarily due to lower levels of interest earning assets 
average loans were down million during the fourth quarter of compared to the net interest margin increased basis points from the fourth quarter of to for the fourth quarter of several factors led to the margin improvement despite continued attrition in the loan portfolio  including united s intensified focus on loan and deposit pricing

for the fourth quarter of  advertising and public relations expense increased  or  mostly reflecting the rollout of united s number one in customer satisfaction campaign 
total foreclosed property expense of million increased million from million for the fourth quarter of  due to additional losses on sales and write downs taken to accelerate the disposition of properties 
fdic assessments and other regulatory charges decreased from million during the fourth quarter of to million for the same period in due to a lower level of average insured deposits upon which the assessment was based

total loans averaged billion in  compared with billion in  a decrease of 
the decrease results from weak loan demand within united s market and management s efforts to reduce united s residential construction concentration 
at december   total loans were billion  a decrease of million  or  from december  the rate of loan growth began to decline in the first quarter of  and the balances have continued to decline through  and the decrease in the loan portfolio began with deterioration in the residential construction and housing markets 
this deterioration resulted in part from an oversupply of lot inventory  houses and land within united s markets  which further slowed construction activities and acquisition and development projects 
the resulting recession that began in the housing market led to high rates of unemployment that resulted in stress in the other segments of united s loan portfolio 
despite the weak economy and lack of loan demand  united continued to pursue lending opportunities which resulted in million in new loans during the following table presents the composition of united s loan portfolio for the last five years

additional information on united s loan administration function is included in item under the heading loan review and nonperforming assets 
united classifies loans as substandard loans when there is a well defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the repayment by the borrower and there is a distinct possibility that united could sustain some loss if the deficiency is not corrected

residential construction loans have represented the largest proportion of both performing substandard and nonperforming loans 
the increase in substandard residential mortgages is primarily related to rising unemployment rates 
the increase in substandard commercial loans reflects the recessionary economic environment 
reviews of substandard performing and nonperforming loans  past due loans and larger credits  are conducted on a regular basis with management and are designed to identify risk migration and potential charges to the allowance for loan losses 
these reviews are performed by the lending officers and the loan review department  and also consider such factors as the financial strength of borrowers  the value of the applicable collateral  past loan loss experience  anticipated loan losses  changes in risk profile  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
united also uses external loan review in addition to united s internal loan review to ensure the independence of the loan review process 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is based on historical data  subjective judgment and estimates and  therefore  is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which charge offs may ultimately occur 
due to the imprecise nature of the loan loss estimation process and the effects of changing conditions  these risk attributes may not be adequately captured in the data related to the formula based loan loss components used to determine allocations in united s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
consequently  management believes that the unallocated allowance appropriately reflects probable inherent but undetected losses in the loan portfolio

nm not meaningful 
the provision for loan losses charged to earnings was based upon management s judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the amount each year is dependent upon many factors including growth and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  net charge offs  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  the value of collateral  and other macro economic factors and trends 
the evaluation of these factors is performed quarterly by management through an analysis of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses 
the decreases in the provision and the stabilization of the level of the allowance for loan losses compared to a year ago reflect stabilizing trends in substandard loans  leading to an expectation that charge off levels will continue to decline 
in addition  the million partial recovery in the fourth quarter of of a previously charged off loan increased the total allowance for loan losses by that amount  thereby reducing the level of loan loss provision needed in management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  reflects the losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this assessment involves uncertainty and judgment  therefore  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses cannot be determined with precision and may be subject to change in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examination of the bank  may require adjustments to the provision for loan losses in future periods if  in their opinion  the results of their review warrant such additions 
see the critical accounting policies section for additional information on the allowance for loan losses 
nonperforming assets nonperforming loans  which include non accrual loans and accruing loans past due over days  totaled million at december  compared with million at december  at december  and  the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was and  respectively 
the sale of approximately million nonperforming loans to fletcher in the second quarter of contributed to the decrease 
nonperforming assets  which include nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate  totaled million at december   compared with million at december  the sale of approximately million of foreclosed properties during  including the sale of million to fletcher in the second quarter of  was offset by the addition of approximately million of new foreclosed properties 
united s position throughout the current economic environment has been to actively and aggressively work to dispose of problem assets quickly 
united s policy is to place loans on non accrual status when  in the opinion of management  the principal and interest on a loan is not likely to be repaid in accordance with the loan terms or when the loan becomes days past due and is not both well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current interest revenue 
interest payments received on non accrual loans are applied as a reduction of principal 
there were no commitments to lend additional funds to customers whose loans were on non accrual status at december   although in certain isolated cases  united executed forbearance agreements whereby united will continue to fund construction loans to completion as long as the borrower meets the conditions of the forbearance agreement

foreclosed property is initially recorded at fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
if the fair value  less estimated costs to sell at the time of foreclosure  is less than the loan balance  the deficiency is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
if the fair value  less estimated costs to sell  of the foreclosed property decreases during the holding period  a valuation allowance is established with a charge to foreclosed property costs

investment securities the composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects united s investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of revenue 
the securities portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet  while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  furnishing liquidity  and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits 
total investment securities at december  decreased million from a year ago 
during the second quarter of  united transferred securities available for sale with a fair value of million to held to maturity 
the transferred securities are those that united has the ability and positive intent to hold until maturity 
generally  the transferred securities had longer durations and were more susceptible to market price volatility due to changes in interest rates 
at december   united had securities held to maturity with a carrying value of million and securities available for sale totaling billion 
at december  and  the securities portfolio represented approximately and of total assets  respectively 
at december   the effective duration of the investment portfolio based on expected maturities was years compared with years at december  the following table shows the carrying value of united s securities

mortgage backed securities rely on the underlying pools of mortgage loans to provide a cash flow of principal and interest 
the actual maturities of these securities will differ from the contractual maturities because the loans underlying the security can prepay 
decreases in interest rates will generally cause an acceleration of prepayment levels 
in a declining interest rate environment  united may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from these prepayments in assets that have comparable yields 
in a rising rate environment  the opposite occurs 
prepayments tend to slow and the weighted average life extends 
this is referred to as extension risk  which can lead to lower levels of liquidity due to the delay of cash receipts  and can result in the holding of a below market yielding asset for a longer period of time 
at december   united had of its total investment securities portfolio in mortgage backed securities  compared with at december  due to a lack of loan demand  united continued to purchase additional mortgage backed securities in order to obtain a favorable yield with low risk 
in late  united began to shift away from mortgage backed securities to avoid extension risk in the event that rates begin to rise 
in  united reinvested the proceeds of maturing fixed rate mortgage backed securities in floating rate collateralized mortgage obligations in order to reinvest additional liquidity without exposure to significant extension risk 
united did not have securities of any issuer in excess of of equity at year end or  excluding us government issues

see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of investment portfolio and related fair value and maturity information 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the premium paid for acquired companies above the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including separately identifiable intangible assets 
united evaluates its goodwill annually  or more frequently if necessary  to determine if any impairment exists 
as a result of the significant drop in united s stock price during the third quarter of  united conducted an interim goodwill impairment test to determine if the stock price decline might indicate goodwill was impaired 
united s third quarter interim impairment test indicated that goodwill was in fact impaired and united recorded a charge to earnings for the entire remaining balance of million 
in performing the interim impairment test  united engaged the services of a national third party valuation expert who employed commonly used valuation techniques including an earnings approach that considered discounted future expected cash earnings and three market approaches 
the third quarter impairment charge followed two earlier impairment charges in the first and third quarters of united performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of december  with no impairment indicated 
conditions through the first two quarters of did not lead management to believe that further impairment was present and interim tests were therefore not performed 
in the third quarter of  united s stock price dropped significantly from at the end of the second quarter to a low of during the third quarter 
this led management to conclude that impairment might be present and an interim impairment test was conducted 
in performing the annual and interim impairment assessments  united engaged the same third party valuation firm who employed a consistent approach to each impairment test 
the first step step of the goodwill impairment analysis was to determine whether the fair value of united exceeded the book value of equity  which would imply that goodwill was not impaired 
the step analysis included three commonly used valuation techniques  including an earnings approach that considered discounted expected future cash earnings and two market approaches 
the first market approach was the guideline public companies method that considered united s implied value by comparing united to a select peer group of public companies and their current market valuation 
the second market approach was the merger and acquisition method that considered the amount an acquiring company might be willing to pay to gain control of united  based on recent merger and acquisition activity 
in the third quarter assessment  the third party valuation firm included a third market approach valuation technique that considered the value of united s stock referred to as the public market price method 
this valuation technique had not been considered in earlier impairment tests as the stock price decline was considered temporary and therefore not considered in the step valuation process 
due to the extended period over which united s stock price had traded at a significant discount to tangible book value  the assertion that the stock price decline was temporary was no longer valid and united s stock price was included in the third quarter impairment test 
inclusion of this valuation technique had a significant impact on the step valuation process and the overall conclusion that goodwill was fully impaired 
in each of the impairment assessments performed in and  the step analysis indicated that the estimated fair value of united had fallen below its book value 
the declining valuation determined in step led to step of the goodwill impairment assessment  which required united to determine the fair value of all its assets and liabilities  including separately identifiable intangible assets  and to determine the implied value of goodwill as the difference between the value of united determined in step and the value of the underlying assets and liabilities determined in step there are a number of valuation assumptions required to determine the value of united s assets and liabilities 
the most significant assumption in determining the estimated fair value of united as a whole and the amount of any resulting impairment was the discount rate used in the discounted cash flows valuation method 
other significant assumptions relate to the value of the loan portfolio 
those assumptions included estimates of cash flows on nonperforming loans  probability of default rates and loss on default rates for performing loans 
changes in those assumptions  or any other significant assumptions  could have a significant impact on the results of the goodwill impairment assessment 
because goodwill is an intangible asset that cannot be sold separately or otherwise disposed of  it is not recognized in determining capital adequacy for regulatory purposes 
therefore  the goodwill impairment charges taken during and had no effect on united s regulatory capital ratios 
other intangible assets  primarily core deposit intangibles representing the value of united s acquired deposit base  are amortizing intangible assets that are required to be tested for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
there were no events or circumstances that lead management to believe that any impairment exists in united s other intangible assets 
deposits united initiated several programs in early to improve core earnings by growing customer transaction deposit accounts and lowering overall pricing on deposit accounts to improve its net interest margin and to increase net interest revenue 
the programs were successful in increasing core transaction deposit accounts and reducing more costly time deposit balances  as united s funding needs decreased due to lower loan demand 
total average deposits for were billion  a decrease of million  or  from average non interest bearing demand deposit accounts increased million  or  due to the success of core deposit programs 
also impacted by the programs were now  money market and savings accounts of billion on average for  which increased million  or  from average time deposits for were billion  down from billion in at december   total deposits were billion compared with billion at the end of  a decrease of million  or 
united lowered its rates on certificates of deposit during and  allowing the balances to decline due to weak loan demand 
additional liquidity also allowed united to reduce brokered deposits  which totaled million at december   compared with million at december  the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities of time deposits of  and greater and brokered time deposits 
table maturities of time deposits of  and greater and brokered deposits as of december  in thousands  and greater three months or less three to six months six to twelve months over one year total brokered deposits three months or less three to six months six to twelve months over one year total wholesale funding the bank is a shareholder in the federal home loan bank fhlb of atlanta 
through this affiliation  secured advances totaling million remained outstanding at december  united anticipates continued use of this short and long term source of funds 
the fhlb advances outstanding at december  had fixed interest rates ranging up to 
during the third quarter of  united prepaid million in fixed rate advances and incurred prepayment charges of million 
united will prepay advances from time to time as funding needs change 
additional information regarding fhlb advances  including scheduled maturities  is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   united had million in repurchase agreements reported as federal funds purchased  repurchase agreements  and other short term borrowings in the consolidated balance sheet  compared to million outstanding at december  united takes advantage of these additional sources of liquidity when rates are favorable compared to other forms of short term borrowings  such as fhlb advances and brokered deposits 
liquidity management liquidity is defined as the ability of a bank to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining united s ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of the bank s customers  both depositors and borrowers 
the primary objective of liquidity management is to ensure that sufficient funding is available  at reasonable cost  to meet ongoing operational cash needs and to take advantage of revenue producing opportunities as they arise 
while the desired level of liquidity will vary depending on a number of factors  it is the primary goal of united to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity in all expected economic environments 
united is a separate entity apart from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
united is responsible for the payment of dividends declared for its common and preferred shareholders  and interest and principal on any outstanding debt or trust preferred securities 
because substantially all of united s liquidity is obtained from subsidiary service fees and dividends from the bank  which are limited by applicable law and the mou  united currently has limited capital resources to meet these obligations 
united has not received a dividend from the bank since and does not anticipate receiving dividends from the bank until  at the earliest 
united deferred the payment of interest on our trust preferred securities and dividends on our preferred stock during the first quarter of as a result of such deferrals  united may not pay dividends on any of common or preferred stock or trust preferred securities until all accrued and unpaid amounts under the deferred securities have been paid 
however  assuming the private placement is completed  united will retain a portion of the proceeds to fund its ongoing obligations 
while we expect these transactions to close in march  there is no assurance that we will be able to satisfy all of the remaining closing requirements on a timely basis 
the primary objectives of asset liability management are to provide for adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of customers and to maintain an optimal balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities  to optimize interest revenue 
daily monitoring of the sources and uses of funds is necessary to maintain a position that meets both objectives 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan sales and repayments and the maturities and sales of securities  as well as the ability to use these as collateral for borrowings on a secured basis 
we also maintain excess funds in short term  interest bearing assets that provide additional liquidity 
mortgage loans held for sale totaled million at december   and typically turn over every days as closed loans are sold to investors in the secondary market 
construction and commercial loans that mature in one year or less amounted to million  or  of the loan portfolio at december  in addition  at december   united had million in commercial paper investments that mature within days 
the liability section of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through the stability of deposit accounts 
federal funds purchased  fhlb advances  brokered deposits  federal reserve discount window borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are additional wholesale sources of liquidity and represent united s additional borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet other short term liquidity needs

at december   united had the capacity to increase brokered deposits by billion and still remain within this limit 
in addition to these wholesale sources  united has the ability to attract retail deposits at any time by competing more aggressively on pricing

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  letters of credit and financial guarantees 
a commitment to extend credit is an agreement to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
letters of credit and financial guarantees are conditional commitments issued to guarantee a customer s performance to a third party and have essentially the same credit risk as extending loan facilities to customers 
those commitments are primarily issued to local businesses 
the exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the commitments to extend credit  letters of credit and financial guarantees is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
united uses the same credit underwriting procedures for making commitments  letters of credit and financial guarantees as for underwriting on balance sheet instruments 
united evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis and the amount of the collateral  if deemed necessary  is based on the credit evaluation 
collateral held varies  but may include unimproved and improved real estate  certificates of deposit  personal property or other acceptable collateral 
all of these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the total amount of these instruments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements because a significant portion of these instruments expire without being used 
united is not involved in off balance sheet contractual relationships  other than those disclosed in this report  that could result in liquidity needs or other commitments  or that could significantly affect earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on off balance sheet arrangements 
capital resources and dividends shareholders equity at december  was million  a decrease of million from december   of which million was due to the third quarter goodwill impairment charge which had no impact on tangible equity

excluding the change in the accumulated other comprehensive income  shareholders equity decreased million  or  from december  during the second quarter of  united recorded a million increase to capital surplus as the result of the issuance of equity instruments to fletcher international in conjunction with the sale of nonperforming assets 
in order to preserve capital  united suspended its cash dividend in the third quarter of and declared a stock dividend of new share for every shares held in the third and fourth quarters of and each of the first three quarters of united accrued million in dividends  including discount accretion  on series a and series b preferred stock  for the year ended december  compared to million for united recognizes that cash dividends are an important component of shareholder value  and therefore  we intend to provide for cash dividends on common stock when earnings  capital levels and other factors permit 
the board of governors of the federal reserve has issued guidelines for the implementation of risk based capital requirements by us banks and bank holding companies 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulators  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers which are used in conjunction with risk weighted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
the guidelines require an total risk based capital ratio  of which must be tier capital 
however  to be considered well capitalized under the guidelines  a total risk based capital ratio is required  of which must be tier capital 
under the risk based capital guidelines  assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor  or  if relevant  the guarantor or the nature of the collateral 
the aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with the category 
the resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are added together  and generally this sum is the company s total risk weighted assets 
risk weighted assets for purposes of united s capital ratios are calculated under these guidelines 
tier capital consists of shareholders equity  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income  intangible assets goodwill and deposit based intangibles  and disallowed deferred tax assets  plus qualifying capital securities 
united s tier capital totaled million at december  tier capital components include supplemental capital such as the qualifying portion of the allowance for loan losses and qualifying subordinated debt 
tier capital plus tier capital is referred to as total risk based capital and was million at december  the ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were and for tier and total risk based capital  respectively  at december  a minimum leverage ratio is required in addition to the risk based capital standards and is defined as tier capital divided by average assets adjusted for goodwill and deposit based intangibles 
although a minimum leverage ratio of is required  the federal reserve board requires a bank holding company to maintain a leverage ratio of greater than if it is experiencing or anticipating significant growth or is operating with less than well diversified risks in the opinion of the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board uses the leverage and risk based capital ratios to assess capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies 
the board resolution provides that united may not incur additional indebtedness  pay cash dividends  make payments on our trust preferred securities or repurchase outstanding stock without prior approval of the federal reserve 
we were not given permission to pay interest on our trust preferred securities and dividends on our preferred stock during the first quarter of as a result of such deferrals  united may not pay dividends on any of common or preferred stock or trust preferred securities until all accrued and unpaid amounts under the deferred securities have been paid 
in addition  the bank is currently subject to the mou which requires  among other things  that the bank maintain its tier leverage ratio at not less than and its total risk based capital ratio at not less than during the life of the mou 
as of december   the bank s tier leverage ratio was below the target level of and management has agreed with the regulators to submit a capital plan to take corrective action in the near future 
additionally  the mou requires that  prior to declaring or paying any cash dividends to united  the bank must obtain the written consent of its regulators 
on december   united participated in treasury s cpp by selling  shares of series b preferred stock and a warrant to purchase  shares  shares  as adjusted for subsequent stock dividends and a reduction following united s stock offering of united s common stock to treasury 
the proceeds of million were allocated between the series b preferred stock and the warrant based on their relative fair values at the time of the sale 
of the million in proceeds  million was allocated to the series b preferred stock and million was allocated to the warrant 
the discount recorded on the series b preferred stock that resulted from allocating a portion of the proceeds to the warrant is being accreted directly to into retained earnings over a five year period applying a level yield 
the exercise price of the warrant is per share per share  as adjusted for subsequent stock dividends and is exercisable at any time on or before december  the series b preferred stock qualifies as tier capital under risk based capital guidelines and will pay cumulative dividends at a rate of per annum for the first five years and per annum thereafter 
the series b preferred stock may be redeemed after december  at the stated amount of  per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends 
prior to december   the series b preferred stock may be redeemed only with proceeds from the sale of qualifying equity securities 
the series b preferred stock is non voting except for class voting rights on matters that would adversely affect the rights of the holders of the series b preferred stock 
united has outstanding junior subordinated debentures related to trust preferred securities totaling million at december  the related trust preferred securities of million excluding common securities qualify as tier capital under risk based capital guidelines provided that total trust preferred securities do not exceed certain quantitative limits

effect of inflation and changing prices a bank s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of a general business corporation in that primarily all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature  with relatively little investment in fixed assets or inventories 
inflation has an important effect on the growth of total assets and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than nominal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
united s management believes the effect of inflation on financial results depends on united s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary effect on performance 
united has an asset liability management program to monitor and manage united s interest rate sensitivity position 
in addition  periodic reviews of banking services and products are conducted to adjust pricing in view of current and expected costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity management the absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant effect on united s profitability 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest revenue to changing interest rates  in order to achieve united s overall financial goals 
based on economic conditions  asset quality and various other considerations  management establishes tolerance ranges for interest rate sensitivity and manages within these ranges 
united s net interest revenue  and the fair value of its financial instruments  are influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
united manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by the alco 
the alco meets periodically and has responsibility for approving asset liability management policies  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and or earnings and reviewing united s interest rate sensitivity 
one of the tools management uses to estimate the sensitivity of net interest revenue to changes in interest rates is an asset liability simulation model 
resulting estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet growth  loan and deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 
the alco regularly reviews the assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations  however  actual net interest revenue may differ from model results 
the primary objective of the simulation model is to measure the potential change in net interest revenue over time using multiple interest rate scenarios 
the base scenario assumes rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared to in order to measure the change in net interest revenue 
policy limits are based on gradually rising and falling rate scenarios  which are compared to this base scenario 
another commonly analyzed scenario is a most likely scenario that projects the most likely change in rates based on the slope of the yield curve 
other scenarios analyzed may include rate shocks  narrowing or widening spreads  and yield curve steepening or flattening 
while policy scenarios focus on a twelve month time frame  longer time horizons are also modeled 
united s policy is based on the month impact on net interest revenue of interest rate ramps that increase basis points and decrease basis points from the base scenario 
in the ramp scenarios  rates change basis points per month over the initial eight months 
the policy limits the change in net interest revenue over the next months to a decrease in either scenario 
the policy ramp and base scenarios assume a static balance sheet 
historically low rates on december  and made use of the down basis point scenario problematic 
at december  united s simulation model indicated that a basis point increase in rates would cause an approximate 
increase in net interest revenue over the next twelve months and a basis point decrease in rates would cause an approximate 
increase in net interest revenue over the next twelve months 
at december   united s simulation model indicated that a basis point increase in rates over the next twelve months would cause an approximate increase in net interest revenue and a basis point decrease in rates over the next twelve months would cause an approximate 
increase in net interest revenue 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the portfolio of assets and liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity during the life of the instruments 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during periods of changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable timeframe  thereby minimizing the effect of interest rate changes on net interest revenue 
united may have some discretion in the extent and timing of deposit repricing depending upon the competitive pressures in the markets in which it operates 
changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly even when the timing of repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same  due to the two instruments repricing according to different indices 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities that are not reflected in an interest rate sensitivity gap analysis 
these prepayments may have significant effect on the net interest margin 
because of these limitations  an interest sensitivity gap analysis alone generally does not provide an accurate assessment of exposure to changes in interest rates 
in order to manage its interest rate sensitivity  united periodically enters into off balance sheet contracts that are considered derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments can be a cost effective and capital effective means of modifying the repricing characteristics of on balance sheet assets and liabilities 
these contracts generally consist of interest rate swaps under which united pays a variable rate and receives a fixed rate and interest rate floor contracts where united pays a premium up front to a counterparty to the right to be compensated if a specified rate index falls below a pre determined floor rate 
united s derivative financial instruments are classified as either cash flow or fair value hedges 
the change in fair value of cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income 
fair value hedges recognize currently in earnings both the effect of the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument and the offsetting effect of the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability associated with the particular risk of that asset or liability being hedged 
at december   united did not have any active derivative contracts outstanding 
from time to time  united will terminate swap or floor positions when conditions change and the position is no longer necessary to manage united s overall sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
in those situations where the terminated swap or floor was in an effective hedging relationship at the time of termination and the hedging relationship is expected to remain effective throughout the original term of the swap or floor  the resulting gain or loss is amortized over the remaining life of the original contract 
for swap contracts  the gain or loss is amortized over the remaining original contract term using the straight line method of amortization 
for floor contracts  the gain or loss is amortized over the remaining original contract term based on the original floorlet schedule 
at december   united had million in gains from terminated derivative positions included in other comprehensive income that will be amortized into earnings over their remaining original contract terms 
approximately million is expected to be reclassified into interest revenue over the next twelve months 
united s policy requires all derivative financial instruments be used only for asset liability management through the hedging of specific transactions or positions  and not for trading or speculative purposes 
management believes that the risk associated with using derivative financial instruments to mitigate interest rate risk sensitivity is minimal and should not have any material unintended effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in order to mitigate potential credit risk  from time to time united may require the counterparties to derivative contracts to pledge securities as collateral to cover the net exposure
