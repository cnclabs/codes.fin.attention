critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate 
the most significant accounting policies we follow are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
application of these principles requires us to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
these factors include among other things  whether the policy requires management to make difficult  subjective  and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the accounting policies which we believe to be most critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements are those that are related to the determination of the reserve for credit losses  fair value estimates  leased asset residual values  mortgage servicing rights  pension and postretirement benefit obligations  and income taxes 
reserve for credit losses a consequence of lending activities is that we may incur losses 
the amount of such losses will vary depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan and lease portfolio as affected by economic conditions such as rising interest rates and the financial performance of borrowers 
the reserve for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance and a reserve for unfunded commitments the unfunded reserve 
the reserve for credit losses provides for credit losses inherent in lending or commitments to lend 
table of contents and is based on loss estimates derived from a comprehensive quarterly evaluation  reflecting analyses of individual borrowers and historical loss experience  supplemented as necessary by credit judgment to address observed changes in trends  conditions  and other relevant environmental and economic factors 
the allowance provides for probable and estimable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance is increased or decreased through the provisioning process 
there is no exact method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular segments of the loan and lease portfolio 
management evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses is often the most critical of accounting estimates for a banking institution 
our determination of the amount of the reserve for credit losses is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated loss rates on homogenous portfolios  and deliberation on economic factors and trends 
on a quarterly basis  an evaluation of specific individual commercial borrowers is performed to identify impaired loans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements and the corporate risk profile section in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a for more information on the allowance and the reserve for credit losses  respectively 
fair value estimates fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market inputs 
for financial instruments that are traded actively and have quoted market prices or observable market inputs  there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value 
however  when quoted market prices or observable market inputs are not fully available  significant management judgment may be necessary to estimate fair value 
in developing our fair value measurements  we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy defines level and valuations as those that are based on quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets and quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market 
level valuations are based on model based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market 
these unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
financial assets that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include available for sale investment securities  mortgage servicing rights  investments related to deferred compensation arrangements  and net derivative assets 
as of december  and  billion or and billion or  respectively  of our total assets consisted of financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
as of december  and  of this amount  billion and billion  respectively  were comprised of available for sale investment securities measured using information from a third party pricing service 
these investments in debt securities and mortgage backed securities were all classified in either levels or of the fair value hierarchy 
as of december  and  level financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were million and million  respectively  or less than of our total assets 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews the pricing information received from our third party pricing service 
this review process includes a comparison to non binding third party broker quotes  as well as a review of market related conditions impacting the information provided by our third party pricing service 
we also identify investment securities which may have traded in illiquid or inactive markets by identifying instances of a significant decrease in the volume or frequency of trades  relative to historic levels  as well as instances of a significant widening of the bid ask spread in the brokered markets 
as of december  and  management did not make adjustments to prices provided by our third 
table of contents party pricing service as a result of illiquid or inactive markets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our fair value estimates 
leased asset residual values lease financing receivables include a residual value component  which represents the estimated value of leased assets upon lease expiration 
our determination of residual value is derived from a variety of sources  including equipment valuation services  appraisals  and publicly available market data on recent sales transactions on similar equipment 
the length of time until lease termination  the cyclical nature of equipment values  and the limited marketplace for re sale of certain leased assets  are important variables considered in making this determination 
we update our valuation analysis on an annual basis  or more frequently as warranted by events or circumstances 
when we determine that the fair value is lower than the expected residual value at lease expiration  the difference is recognized as an asset impairment in the period in which the analysis is completed 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the residual value of our leveraged leased assets 
mortgage servicing rights when mortgage loans are sold with servicing rights retained  a servicing asset is established and accounted for based on estimated fair values 
an estimated fair value is used because there is no quoted or established market for mortgage servicing rights 
the estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flow modeling techniques  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  loan repayment rates  costs to service  and interest rates that reflect the risks involved 
our estimates of the fair value of mortgage servicing rights are sensitive to changes in the underlying estimates and assumptions 
had we assumed lower interest rates and higher loan repayment rates  the estimated fair value of our mortgage servicing rights may have been lower than recorded in our consolidated statements of condition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for key assumptions used by management as well as a sensitivity analysis of changes in certain key assumptions 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost are actuarially determined based on a number of key assumptions  including the discount rate  estimated future return on plan assets  and the health care cost trend rate 
our determination of the pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and judgment related to the amount and timing of expected future cash out flows for benefit payments and cash in flows for maturities and return on plan assets 
changes in estimates and assumptions related to mortality rates and future health care costs could also have a material impact to our financial condition or results of operations 
a discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost 
the discount rate used to value the present value of future benefit obligations as of each year end is the rate used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the following year

income taxes we determine our liabilities for income taxes based on current tax regulation and interpretations in tax jurisdictions where our income is subject to taxation 
currently  we file tax returns in nine federal  state and local domestic jurisdictions  and four foreign jurisdictions 
in estimating income taxes payable or receivable  we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of each tax position 
accordingly  previously estimated liabilities are regularly reevaluated and adjusted  through the provision for income taxes 
changes in the estimate of income taxes payable or receivable occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax law  the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities  and newly enacted statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative merits and risks of each tax position 
these changes  when they occur  may affect the provision for income taxes as well as current and deferred income taxes  and may be significant to our statements of income and condition 
management determination of the realization of net deferred tax assets is based upon management judgment of various future events and uncertainties  including the timing and amount of future income  as well as the implementation of various tax planning strategies to maximize realization of the deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of december  and  we carried a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  related to our deferred tax assets established in connection with our low income housing investments 
we are required to record a liability  referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit utb  for the entire amount of benefit taken in a prior or future income tax return when we determine that a tax position has a less than likelihood of being accepted by the taxing authority 
as of december  and  our liabilities for utbs were million and million  respectively

trust and asset management income is comprised of fees earned from the management and administration of trusts and other customer assets 
these fees are largely based upon the market value of the assets that we manage and the fee rate charged to customers 
total trust assets under administration were billion as of december   billion as of december   and billion as of december  trust and asset management income decreased by million or in compared to this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in mutual fund management fees due in large part to the sale liquidation of our proprietary mutual funds in july  combined with an increase in fee waivers and a decrease in the holdings of our money market mutual funds 
this decrease was partially offset by a combined million increase in agency fees  irrevocable trust fees  and ira fees primarily due to higher market values and higher fee rates for assets previously invested in our proprietary mutual funds 
trust and asset management income decreased by million or in compared to this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in mutual fund management fees  which were adversely affected by an increase in fee waivers in our money market mutual funds due to low yields  a decline in average mutual fund holdings  combined with a decline in the average value of the equity markets in also contributing to the decrease in trust and asset management income was a million decrease in employee benefit trust and agency fees primarily due to the decrease in the market value of accounts and the average number of accounts under management 
finally  investment management fees decreased by million primarily due to customers moving certain investment accounts to bankoh investment services  inc  the broker dealer subsidiary of the bank  to take advantage of alternative investment options 
mortgage banking income is highly influenced by mortgage interest rates and the housing market

also contributing to the decrease was a million decrease in overdraft fees mainly resulting from the federal reserve board amendments of regulation e  largely offset by account growth 
beginning on july  for new customers and august  for existing customers  these amendments to regulation e prohibit a financial institution from assessing a fee to complete an atm withdrawal or one time debit card transaction which will cause an overdraft unless the customer consents in advance opts in 
we estimate that due to the frb amendments to regulation e  overdraft fees decreased by approximately million in service charges on deposit accounts increased by million or in compared to primarily due to a million increase in account analysis fees on analyzed business checking accounts as a result of lower earnings credit rates on customer accounts 
this was partially offset by a million decrease in monthly service fees primarily resulting from the introduction of our free checking product in july fees  exchange  and other service charges are primarily comprised of debit card income  fees from atms  merchant service activity  and other loan fees and service charges 
fees  exchange  and other service charges increased by million or in compared to primarily due to a million increase in debit card income resulting mainly from account growth 
in july  the dodd frank act became law

included in fees  exchange  and other service charges are debit card interchange fees of approximately million in  million in  and million in assuming constant debit card activity  we estimate that the proposed regulations  which are likely to be effective in july  could potentially reduce our debit card interchange fees by approximately or million on an annualized basis 
the increase in debit card income was partially offset by a million decrease in atm fees primarily due to lower transaction volume and a million decrease in income from merchant services 
fees  exchange  and other service charges decreased by million or in compared to primarily due to a decrease in atm fee income as well as lower merchant services income 
this was the result of lower transaction volume during which was impacted by a slower economy in hawaii and lower levels of visitor arrivals

the fhlb capital plan provides for the mandatory redemption of members stock within five years of such request 
in  the bank requested the redemption of  shares  which under the provisions of the fhlb capital plan would be redeemable in in august  the fhlb received a capital classification of undercapitalized from their primary regulator  the federal housing finance agency the finance agency 
as of september   the fhlb met all of its regulatory capital requirements  but remained classified as undercapitalized by the finance agency due to several factors including the possibility that declines in the value of its private label mortgage backed securities could cause it to fall below its risk based capital requirements 
due to this determination  the fhlb currently remains unable to repurchase or redeem capital stock or to pay dividends 
the fhlb submitted a proposed capital restoration plan to the finance agency in august in april  the finance agency requested a more specific business plan with steps the fhlb will take to resume timely redemptions and repurchases of member capital stock 
the fhlb submitted their proposed business plan to the finance agency in august in october  the finance agency and the fhlb agreed to the stipulation and issuance of a consent order by the finance agency that sets forth requirements for capital management  asset composition  and other operational and risk management improvements 
additionally  the finance agency and the fhlb agreed to a stabilization period that ends upon the filing of the fhlb june  financial statements 
during this period  the fhlb classification as undercapitalized will remain in place 
subsequently  the fhlb may begin repurchasing member stock at par  upon achieving and maintaining financial thresholds established by the finance agency 
the consent order and associated agreement with the fhlb constitute the fhlb capital restoration plan and fulfills the finance agency april request to the fhlb 
the fhlb reported positive net income for the first nine months of and reported increased levels of capital as of september  compared to december  the bank also continues to use and has access to the services of the fhlb 
management is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the redemption of our shares

the allocation of the allowance to our commercial portfolio decreased by million from december   primarily due to a million decrease in allocation to our leasing portfolio that resulted from strategic sales of our leveraged leases 
the allocation of the allowance to our consumer portfolio increased by million from december   primarily due to a million increase in allocation to our residential mortgage portfolio 
this was consistent with the increased risk of loss in these lending portfolios 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the allowance and credit quality indicators 
reserve for unfunded commitments the unfunded reserve was million as of december   unchanged from december  the process used to determine the unfunded reserve is consistent with the process for determining the allowance  as adjusted for estimated funding probabilities or loan and lease equivalency factors 
residential mortgage loan repurchases we sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market primarily to fannie mae 
we also pool federal housing administration fha insured and us department of veterans affairs va guaranteed mortgage loans for sale to ginnie mae 
these pools of fha insured and va guaranteed residential mortgage loans are securitized by ginnie mae 
the agreements under which we sell residential mortgage loans to fannie mae or ginnie mae and the insurance or guaranty agreements with fha and va contain provisions that include various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the residential mortgage loans 
although the specific representations and warranties vary among investors  insurance or guarantee agreements  they typically cover ownership of the loan  validity of the lien securing the loan  the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan  compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement  compliance with applicable federal  state  and local laws  and other matters 
as of december   the unpaid principal balance of our portfolio of residential mortgage loans sold on a non recourse basis was billion 
the agreements under which we sell residential mortgage loans require us to deliver various documents to the investor or its document custodian 
although these loans are sold on a non recourse basis  we may be obligated to repurchase residential mortgage loans where required documents are not delivered or are defective 
investors may require the immediate repurchase of a mortgage loan when an early payment default underwriting review reveals significant underwriting deficiencies  even if the mortgage loan has subsequently been brought current 
upon receipt of a repurchase request  we work with investors or insurers to arrive at a mutually agreeable resolution 
repurchase demands are typically reviewed on an individual loan by loan basis to validate the claims made by the investor or insurer and to determine if a contractually required repurchase event has occurred 
we manage the risk associated with potential repurchases or other forms of settlement through our underwriting and quality assurance practices and by servicing mortgage loans to meet investor and secondary market standards 
in december  we received a million repurchase request from an investor 
subsequently  in january  we agreed to repurchase these loans as requested 
these loans were current as to principal and interest at the time of repurchase 
as of december   the unpaid principal balance of our portfolio of residential mortgage loans sold on a recourse basis was million 
these loans were originated in the early s 
we are obligated to repurchase these loans when they become days or more past due or if they exhibit 
table of contents significant underwriting deficiencies as described above 
in  we repurchased million in residential mortgage loans from our investors as a result of the representation and warranty provisions contained in these contracts 
although  to date  repurchase demands have been limited  it is possible that requests to repurchase mortgage loans may increase in frequency as investors more aggressively pursue all means of recovering losses on their purchased loans 
however  as of december   we believe that this exposure is not material and thus have not established a liability for losses related to mortgage loan repurchases 
we maintain ongoing communications with our investors and will continue to evaluate this exposure by monitoring the level and number of repurchase requests as well as the delinquency rates in our investor portfolios 
risks relating to residential mortgage loan servicing activities in addition to servicing loans in our portfolio  substantially all of the loans we sell to investors are sold with servicing rights retained 
the loans we service were originated by us or by other mortgage loan originators 
as servicer  our primary duties are to collect payments due from borrowers  advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest  maintain and administer any hazard  title  or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage loans  maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments  and foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or  to the extent consistent with the documents governing a securitization  consider alternatives to foreclosure  such as loan modifications or short sales 
each agreement under which we act as servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for actions taken by us in such capacity and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred by us when acting in compliance with the respective servicing agreements 
however  if we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer  we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period following notice 
the standards governing servicing and the possible remedies for violations of such standards vary by investors 
these standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides issued by the investors as well as the contract provisions established between the investors and the bank 
remedies could include indemnification or repurchase of an affected mortgage loan 
in  we did not receive any indemnification or repurchase requests as a result of our servicing activities 
market risk market risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices 
we are exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting our business activities 
our market risk management process involves measuring  monitoring  controlling  and mitigating risks that can significantly impact our statements of income and condition 
in this management process  market risks are balanced with expected returns in an effort to enhance earnings performance  while limiting volatility 
the activities associated with these market risks are categorized into trading and other than trading 
our trading activities include foreign currency and foreign exchange contracts that expose us to a small degree of foreign currency risk 
these transactions are primarily executed on behalf of customers 
our other than trading activities include normal business transactions that expose our balance sheet profile to varying degrees of market risk 
our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk the objective of our interest rate risk management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity 
the potential cash flows  sales  or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities  especially those that earn or pay interest  are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
this interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans 
many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates  such as general economic and financial conditions  customer preferences  historical pricing 
table of contents relationships  and repricing characteristics of financial instruments 
our earnings are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us and its agencies  particularly the frb 
the monetary policies of the frb can influence the overall growth of loans  investment securities  and deposits and the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities 
the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies are generally not predictable 
in managing interest rate risk  we  through the asset liability management committee alco  measure short and long term sensitivities to changes in interest rates 
the alco  which is comprised of members of executive management  utilizes several techniques to manage interest rate risk  which include adjusting balance sheet mix or altering the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities  changing product pricing strategies  modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio  or using derivative financial instruments 
the use of derivative financial instruments  as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  has generally been limited 
this is due to natural on balance sheet hedges arising out of offsetting interest rate exposures from loans and investment securities with deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
in particular  the investment securities portfolio is utilized to manage the interest rate exposure and sensitivity to within the guidelines and limits established by the alco 
natural and offsetting hedges reduce the need to employ off balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk exposures 
expected movements in interest rates are also considered in managing interest rate risk 
thus  as interest rates change  we may use different techniques to manage interest rate risk 
a key element in our ongoing process to measure and monitor interest rate risk is the utilization of an asset liability simulation model 
the model is used to estimate and measure the balance sheet sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
these estimates are based on assumptions on the behavior of loan and deposit pricing  repayment rates on mortgage based assets  and principal amortization and maturities on other financial instruments 
the model analytics include the effects of standard prepayment options on mortgages and customer withdrawal options for deposits 
while such assumptions are inherently uncertain  we believe that these assumptions are reasonable 
as a result  the simulation model attempts to capture the dynamic nature of the balance sheet 
we utilize net interest income simulations to analyze short term income sensitivities to changes in interest rates 
table presents  for the next twelve months subsequent to december    and  an estimate of the change in net interest income that would result from a gradual change in interest rates  moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve  relative to the measured base case scenario 
the base case scenario assumes the balance sheet and interest rates are generally unchanged 
based on the net interest income simulation as of december   net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of december  exhibited an asset sensitive profile and was less sensitive to higher interest rates and more sensitive to lower interest rates as compared to the sensitivity profiles as of december  and market conditions remain uncertain at the end of  although they have improved since the end of government intervention has caused interest rates to remain relatively low and has decreased market volatility 
credit spreads continued to narrow in these factors have contributed to greater interest rate risk to the company as of december  
table of contents net interest income sensitivity profile table impact on future net interest income december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates basis points to analyze the impact of changes in interest rates in a more realistic manner  non parallel interest rate scenarios are also simulated 
these non parallel interest rate scenarios indicate that net interest income may decrease from the base case scenario should the yield curve flatten or become inverted for a period of time 
conversely  if the yield curve should steepen further from its mostly normal profile  net interest income may increase 
we also use the market value of equity mve sensitivity analysis to estimate the net present value change in our net assets ie  assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments from changes in interest rates 
the mve was approximately billion as of december  and  and billion as of december  the mve increased as of december  compared to december  due to strong deposit growth in in  the mve was stable compared to due to more stable market conditions 
interest rates were lower over most of the yield curve and deposit growth continued  offset by a greater level of investment securities 
table presents  as of december    and  an estimate of the pre tax change in the mve that would result from an instantaneous and basis point increase or a basis point decrease in interest rates  moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve 
the mve sensitivity decreased as of december  compared to december  as a result of lower interest rates  higher deposit balances  and a shorter duration investment portfolio as of december  lower rate scenarios will now have a negative impact to mve as further meaningful reductions in deposit rates will be difficult 

table of contents market value of equity sensitivity profile table change in market value of equity december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates basis points liquidity management liquidity is managed in an effort to provide continuous access to sufficient  reasonably priced funds 
funding requirements are impacted by loan originations and refinancings  deposit growth  liability issuances and settlements  and off balance sheet funding commitments 
we consider and comply with various regulatory guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitor our liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity 
based on periodic liquidity assessments  we may alter our asset  liability  and off balance sheet positions 
the alco monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change 
this process  combined with our ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements  provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk 
in an effort to satisfy our liquidity needs  we actively manage our assets and liabilities 
the potential sources of short term liquidity include interest bearing deposits as well as the ability to sell certain assets including available for sale investment securities 
assets generate long term liquidity through cash flows from investment securities and loans 
with respect to liabilities  short term liquidity is generated from securities sold under agreements to repurchase  federal funds  and fhlb advances  while long term liquidity is generated through growth in deposits and long term debt 
we continued to maintain a strong liquidity position in total deposits were billion as of december   a million or increase from december  during  we continued to invest excess liquidity primarily in mortgage backed securities issued by ginnie mae 
these investments in high grade securities have an average base duration of less than three years 
capital management in our ongoing efforts to maximize shareholder value over time  we regularly review our capital management activities including the amount of earnings we retain in excess of cash dividends paid and the amount and pace of common stock repurchases 
we also seek to maintain capital levels for the company and the bank at amounts in excess of the regulatory well capitalized thresholds by an amount commensurate with our risk profile 
periodically  we may respond to market conditions by implementing changes to our overall balance sheet positioning to manage our capital position 
the company and the bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can cause certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a material effect on our financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative and qualitative measures 
these measures were established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy 
as of december   the company and the bank were well capitalized under this regulatory framework 
there have been no conditions or events since december  that management believes have changed either the company or the bank capital classifications

in july  the bcbs announced the design for its capital and liquidity reform proposal 
in december  the oversight body of the basel committee published the final basel iii rules on capital  leverage  and liquidity 
basel iii requires financial institutions to have more capital and a higher quality of capital 
it does so by increasing the minimum regulatory capital ratios  narrowing the definition of capital  and requiring capital buffers 
basel iii also imposes a leverage ratio requirement and liquidity standards 
the new minimum capital requirements will be phased in between january and january as follows the minimum requirement for tier common equity ratio will be increased from the current to  the minimum requirement for the tier capital ratio to be considered adequately capitalized will be increased from the current to  an additional of tier common equity to total risk weighted assets to be phased in between january  and january  and a minimum tier leverage ratio of to be tested starting january  
the liquidity proposals under basel iii include a liquidity coverage ratio to become effective january   a net stable funding ratio to become effective january   and a set of monitoring tools to establish minimum reporting requirements of financial institutions to their regulatory supervisors 
the liquidity coverage ratio is designed to ensure that banks have a sufficient stock of high quality liquid assets to survive a significant liquidity stress scenario lasting days 
the net stable funding ratio is designed to promote resilience over a longer period of one year by encouraging banks to fund themselves with a minimum amount of
