item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operating results should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
throughout this section  references to notes refer to the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements 
overview effective january   our business operations were reorganized into two new divisions in order to further align our business units with the underlying markets and customers they serve 
all historical periods have been restated for the changes to our segment reporting structure 
we manage and operate our business through the following two segments pharmaceutical packaging systems packaging systems and pharmaceutical delivery systems delivery systems 
packaging systems manufactures and sells primary packaging components and systems for injectable drug delivery  including stoppers and seals for vials  closures and other components used in syringe  intravenous and blood collection systems  and prefillable syringe components 
delivery systems provides safety and administration systems  multi component systems for drug administration  and a variety of custom contract manufacturing solutions targeted to the healthcare and consumer products industries 
in addition  delivery systems is responsible for the continued development and commercialization of our line of proprietary  multi component systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications 
west has also formed global partnerships to share technologies and market products with affiliates in japan and mexico 
as a result of our global manufacturing and distribution presence  more than half of our revenues are generated outside of the us in currencies other than the us dollar  including in europe and collectively in south america  asia and other regions 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  therefore  can have a significant effect on our consolidated financial results 
generally  our financial results are affected positively by a weaker us dollar and negatively by a stronger us dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business 
in terms of net sales and operating profit  the most significant foreign currencies are the euro  the british pound  the danish krone and the singapore dollar  with euro denominated sales representing the majority of sales transacted in foreign currencies 
during  on average  the us dollar appreciated almost against the euro and was mixed against other key currencies  resulting in lower reported revenues and operating profit of million and million  respectively  versus the prior year 
financial performance highlights net sales were  million  higher than the prior year s sales 
excluding impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  net sales increased million  or 
gross profit increased to million  higher than  and our gross margin percentage remained unchanged at 
segment operating profit was million  slightly higher than the amount earned in including corporate costs and other unallocated charges  reported operating profit for was million compared with million in the prior year 
net income from continuing operations for was million  or per diluted share compared to million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
our financial position remains very strong  with net cash flow from operations totaling million in  slightly higher than the prior year 
our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from to per share which began with the fourth quarter dividend 

table of contents we achieved higher sales and gross profit in when compared to the prior year  driven by improved performance of our delivery systems segment and sustained by higher packaging systems sales  despite downward pressure from foreign currency exchange rates and the surge in hn vaccination related sales 
during  we experienced unusually high demand as a result of the hn vaccination effort that resulted in non recurring sales of million in the second half of that year 
we were able to replace those vaccine sales and grow revenue in with an improved sales mix and increased demand for other products 
year over year sales increases were generated in all of our major geographic regions 
total sales originating in the us were million  up from the prior year  reflecting higher domestic demand for pharmaceutical packaging components and increased contract manufacturing activity 
revenues generated outside of the us were million  an increase of which reflected higher pharmaceutical packaging demand in south america and continued growth in the asia pacific region 
consolidated gross profit improved over the prior year as a result of increased demand  an improved sales mix and due to the benefits from cost reduction efforts within both segments 
in addition  increased production levels contributed to improved manufacturing efficiency 
segment operating profit for was slightly higher than the prior year despite higher r d spending on our key development projects and increased sg a in support of our newly reorganized business structure 
overall  our pricing management  favorable sales mix and manufacturing cost reduction initiatives resulted in gross profit improvement that outweighed the increased general and administrative costs during reported operating profit and net income for the current year were lower than primarily due to higher severance and asset impairment charges resulting from our fourth quarter restructuring program 
our financial condition remains strong with increased cash flow from operations and a significant year over year reduction in net debt 
restructuring initiatives in december  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan designed to reduce our cost structure and improve operating efficiency by consolidating certain operations and eliminating certain redundant positions 
the plan involves the closure of one manufacturing plant in the us and a longer term reduction in operations at another manufacturing facility in the uk these restructuring activities will also result in the elimination of certain administrative  engineering and operating positions at various other locations 
we expect to incur approximately million to million in total restructuring and related charges through the end of  which consists of million to million in cash expenditures for severance and costs associated with the plant closure and relocation of certain assets  and million to million in asset impairment and disposal charges 
the plan is expected to generate savings of approximately million in  increasing to million annually when fully implemented beginning in during  we incurred actual charges of million consisting of million in severance and employee benefits and million in asset impairment charges 
in november  we announced restructuring plans to exit certain specialized laboratory service offerings due to a change in market demand  reduce support personnel primarily associated with information technology applications  and consolidate contract manufacturing operations and support functions 
the total charges incurred in and amounted to million  which consisted of million in cash expenditures related to employee severance benefits and asset relocation costs  and million in asset impairment and disposal charges  primarily related to removing certain laboratory equipment and plant assets from service 
the plan and related activities were completed in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents business acquisitions in july  our delivery systems segment acquired of the outstanding shares of la model ltd  a developer of an electronic patch injector system using pre filled cartridge technology 
the purchase price included cash paid at closing of million and contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of million 
the contingent consideration is payable to the selling shareholders based on a percentage of product sales over the next seventeen years 
the purchase price allocation resulted in million of in process research and development assets  million of goodwill and million of deferred tax liabilities 
the operating results  which consisted mostly of research and development expense in  were included within the delivery systems segment from the date of acquisition 
in july  we acquired the ris safety syringe system and other intellectual property and business assets from plastef investissements sa 
the ris safety syringe system addresses the market for fixed needle prefilled syringes and complements our novaguard safety system  which employs the other common syringe format  luer lock syringes 
the purchase price included cash paid at closing of million  and contingent consideration with an original fair value of million which is dependent upon the achievement of operating goals and other milestones from the acquisition date through the end of the purchase price allocation consisted primarily of million of property  plant and equipment  million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets  offset by million of lease obligations 
sales and operating results generated from the acquired business were included within our delivery systems segment 
business outlook long term demographic trends are consistent with prior years and continue to drive our growth 
our business outlook for is positive  but growth will continue to be hampered by a slow global economic recovery  consolidation among our pharmaceutical customers  and uncertainties surrounding the financial impact of us healthcare reform 
despite these external factors  demand for our products is favorable and we anticipate continued revenue improvement from a favorable mix of product sales including our advanced packaging product offerings and safety and administration systems 
our high value product portfolio is expanding and continues to be a significant area of our focus 
actions taken in recent years to increase capacity for certain products  reduce costs through restructuring  and expand into emerging markets will lead to improved profitability as global demand gradually increases 
given our positive growth outlook  we plan to continue funding capital projects in emerging markets for packaging systems and for new  proprietary products within delivery systems 
during  we expect our capital spending to be between million and million 
our strong financial position gives us a solid platform for sustained growth  and will enable us to take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business as they arise 
results of operations for the purpose of aiding the comparison of our year to year results  we often refer to net sales  operating profit and other financial results excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the constant currency amounts are calculated by translating the current year s functional currency results at the prior year period s exchange rate 
these re measured results are not in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and should not be used as a substitute for the related us gaap financial measures 
the non us gaap financial measures are incorporated into our discussion and analysis because management believes that these non gaap measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain business trends relating to our financial condition  results of operations and our overall performance 
we believe that the use of these non gaap financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends in comparing our financial measures with other companies 

table of contents we evaluate the performance of our segments based upon  among other things  segment sales and operating profit 
segment operating profit excludes general corporate costs  including stock based compensation  adjustments to annual bonus plan expense for over or under attainment  and certain pension and other retirement benefit costs 
also excluded from segment operating profit are items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations 
such items are referred to as other unallocated items and generally include restructuring and related charges  certain asset impairments and other miscellaneous gains and losses 
corporate costs include executive and director compensation  stock based compensation and other corporate facilities and administrative expenses that are not allocated to the segments 
percentages in the following tables and throughout the results of operations section may reflect rounding adjustments 
net sales the following table presents net sales  consolidated and by reportable segment year ended december  change in millions packaging systems delivery systems intersegment sales total net sales compared to consolidated net sales increased million over those achieved in the prior year despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of million 
excluding foreign currency translation effects  net sales increased million  or  from the prior year 
the increase was principally due to the favorable impact of improved sales volume and mix of percentage points  annual selling price increases of percentage points  and percentage points resulting from business acquisitions within our delivery systems segment 
packaging systems this segment contributed million to the full year sales increase  despite an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of million and the surge in hn vaccination related sales 
excluding currency translation effects  sales were million  or  above prior year levels resulting from favorable volume and product mix of million and higher selling prices of million 
the favorable volume and mix came primarily from sales of pharmaceutical packaging products due to increased demand for stoppers and seals used by our customers in packaging serums  lyophilized drugs  and for intravenous applications 
contributing to this improvement were increased sales of our advanced pharmaceutical packaging products including westar processed and flurotec coated closures as well as envision inspected components which were first introduced in the sales increase was net of the impact from non recurring hn sales which benefited sales by million 
delivery systems full year sales were million higher than levels  despite million of unfavorable foreign currency translation 
excluding the impact of foreign currency changes  sales were million  or  higher than prior year levels 
the increase was principally driven by favorable volume and product mix of million  and incremental sales from business acquisitions of million 
the majority of the favorable volume and mix came from healthcare devices due to strong customer demand for contract manufactured components and increased sales of our proprietary safety and administration systems 
compared to consolidated net sales increased marginally over those achieved in despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of million 
excluding foreign currency translation effects  net sales increased million  or  from the amount 
the increase was principally due to the favorable impact of annual selling price increases of percentage points  improved sales volume and mix of percentage points and percentage points resulting from our july acquisition of the ris safety syringe business 

table of contents packaging systems this segment contributed million to the full year sales increase  net of an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of million 
excluding currency translation effects  sales were million  or  above prior year levels 
the increase was principally driven by higher selling prices of million and favorable volume and product mix of million 
the favorable volume and mix was due mainly to higher demand for pharmaceutical packaging components including stoppers used in various drugs including the hn influenza vaccine and increased demand for prefilled injection packaging components used in insulin applications 
delivery systems full year sales were million below levels  including million of unfavorable foreign currency translation 
excluding the impact of foreign currency changes  sales were million  or  below prior year levels 
the decrease was the result of reduced selling prices of million due to lower plastic resin prices  which are contractually passed through to many customers in the form of adjusted selling prices  and unfavorable volume and product mix of million 
volumes were lower primarily due to the loss of certain contract manufactured components which were discontinued during partially offsetting these volume decreases were incremental sales from our ris business acquisition of million 
the majority of intersegment sales eliminations in all periods presented represent sales of plastic packaging components from delivery systems to packaging systems 
gross profit the following table presents our gross profit and related gross margins  consolidated and by reportable segment year ended december  change in millions packaging systems gross profit gross margin delivery systems gross profit gross margin consolidated gross profit consolidated gross margin compared to consolidated gross profit increased by million over full year results  despite an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of million  as a result of higher sales in both of our reporting segments 
our gross margin percentage in was unchanged from the prior year as we were able to maintain margins with higher sales prices and a favorable sales volume and product mix  despite increased raw material  labor and depreciation expense 
packaging systems our reported gross profit of million increased million  and the gross margin percentage increased percentage points compared with the results 
the increase was primarily the result of improved production efficiencies which resulted from higher volumes and operational cost saving initiatives 
the impact of selling price increases effectively offset year over year increases in labor cost  raw materials and other production costs incurred during the year 
delivery systems reported gross profit of million increased by million compared with the full year result  and our gross margin percentage remained constant at 
the higher gross profit was driven by an improvement in sales mix and higher demand for our contract manufactured healthcare devices  partially offset by increased raw material costs 

table of contents compared to consolidated gross profit increased by million over full year results  despite an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of million 
excluding foreign exchange impacts  gross profit increased by million  or  as a result of higher selling prices and a significant fourth quarter increase in volume and mix contributed by packaging systems 
our overall gross margin percentage remained consistent with as we were able to maintain margins through sales price increases and improved volume and mix  partially offset by higher depreciation expense as described below 
packaging systems our reported gross profit of million was relatively consistent when compared with the results  despite an unfavorable foreign currency impact of million 
however  the gross margin percentage for packaging systems declined by percentage points compared with the decline was attributable to higher depreciation expense resulting from our global capital expansion activity which began in the latter half of delivery systems reported gross profit of million increased by million compared with the full year results  including million in unfavorable foreign currency effects 
consistent with the increase in gross profit  our gross margin percentage improved percentage points to compared with the prior year largely due to the impact of reduced resin costs on selling prices which resulted in a higher ratio of gross profit to revenues 
research and development r d costs year ended december  change in millions r d costs r d costs during were million higher than those incurred in  primarily due to the impact of business acquisitions and incremental development spending on delivery systems initiatives including various containment and delivery solutions using daikyo s crystal zenith technology 
r d costs during were million higher than those incurred in  mostly due to accelerated development spending on our high value packaging and injection systems and ready to use components 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs year ended december  change in millions sg a costs sg a as a of total net sales compared to consolidated sg a expenses increased million above those recognized in the increase was primarily the result of higher employee compensation costs for higher sales and other incentive compensation  annual salary increases  and increased staffing in support of our january business segment realignment 
despite the increase in year over year costs  sg a as a percentage of net sales remained relatively consistent at 
for  we expect cost control efforts to result in lower year over year growth in sg a when compared with and compared to consolidated sg a expenses in were million higher than the amount  and sg a as a percentage of net sales increased by percentage points versus the prior year 
the majority of this increase resulted from higher us pension and other retirement plan costs 
us pension and other retirement benefits expense in was million higher than the amount due to increased amortization of actuarial losses and a lower return on plan assets resulting from the loss in plan asset values during the stock market decline 
other year over year increases resulted from higher employee compensation costs due to increased staffing of information technology and other support functions and from the impact of annual salary increases 

table of contents restructuring  impairment and other items other income and expense items  consisting primarily of gains  losses or impairments of segment assets  and foreign exchange transaction gains and losses  are generally recorded within segment and corporate results 
certain restructuring  impairments and other specifically identified gains and losses considered outside the control of segment management are not allocated to our reporting segments 
the following table summarizes our restructuring charges  impairments  and other income and expense items for each of the three years ended december in millions segments corporate and other unallocated items corporate restructuring and related charges acquisition related contingencies brazil tax amnesty benefits impairment charge  contract settlement and related gain  net total restructuring  impairment and other items for  the increase in segments other expense was attributable to foreign exchange transaction losses on accounts payable  primarily due to the appreciation of the us dollar and japanese yen versus the euro 
restructuring and related charges during  we incurred restructuring and related charges of million comprised of employee severance and benefits of million  fixed asset impairment charges of million  and fixed asset relocation costs and other related charges of million 
the majority of these charges related to the restructuring plan announced in december of during  we recognized restructuring and related charges of million  comprised of employee severance and benefits costs of million  asset impairment and disposals charges of million  and million in asset relocation costs 
the majority of this charge resulted from our fourth quarter restructuring plan 
during  we incurred million in restructuring costs  consisting mostly of employee severance benefits  asset impairments  and accelerated depreciation associated with the completion of a plan initiated in late by our former tech group segment 
acquisition related contingencies during  we reduced our liability for contingent consideration associated with our ris acquisition by million to reflect our revised assessment of fair value  as affected by a reduction in the probability of attaining certain milestones over the next four years 
brazil tax penalties and amnesty benefits in the third quarter of  we enrolled in a tax amnesty program which provided for reduced penalties and interest on certain tax related obligations resulting in a gain of million 
impairment charge  contract settlement and related gain  net during the fourth quarter of  we determined that a cost basis investment that arose from the divestiture of a former drug delivery business was impaired and we recorded a million charge to write off our investment 
during and  under a contract settlement agreement with a former customer  we received reimbursement for costs associated with the shutdown of manufacturing operations related to their device 
during  cash received more than offset costs incurred  resulting in a net gain of million 
refer to note  restructuring and other items  to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the restructuring  impairment and other items within this section 

table of contents operating profit operating profit loss by reportable segment  corporate and other unallocated costs was as follows in millions packaging systems delivery systems corporate and other unallocated items corporate costs other unallocated charges income consolidated operating profit compared to consolidated operating profit for was lower than the prior year as a result of an increase in other unallocated charges  the majority of which was due to higher restructuring and related charges 
refer to the restructuring  impairment and other items section above for a discussion of these items 
packaging systems our results for packaging systems were higher by million as a result of the improvement in gross profit  partially offset by a million increase in sg a as a result of higher employee compensation costs 
excluding a million unfavorable foreign exchange impact  packaging systems operating profit exceeded the amount by million 
delivery systems delivery systems operating profit was million below that achieved in  as the increase in gross profit was offset by higher sg a costs and an increase in r d in support of their key product development projects 
compared to consolidated operating profit for was lower by million when compared with  the majority of which related to higher corporate and other unallocated costs of million 
the majority of the increased corporate costs related to the us pension and other retirement benefits expense 
other unallocated costs were higher mainly as a result of restructuring and related charges incurred in compared with a net gain from a former customer contract settlement recorded in year over year segment operating profit declined million as described below 
packaging systems the packaging systems segment s results were lower by million  primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 
the year over year unfavorable foreign exchange impact was million  the majority of which resulted from the strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro during excluding the unfavorable foreign currency changes  operating profit for packaging systems was lower by million compared with delivery systems delivery systems operating profit was million below that achieved in  largely due to increased sg a costs for annual compensation increases and costs associated with our information systems upgrades 
in addition  unfavorable foreign currency changes which reduced operating profit by million 
interest expense  net the following table summarizes our net interest expense in millions interest expense capitalized interest interest income total interest expense  net 
table of contents consolidated interest expense  net for was higher than the prior year due to less capitalized interest resulting from significantly lower levels of capital spending in the current year 
refer to the cash flows from investing activities section below for a year over year comparison of capital spending 
consolidated interest expense  net for was relatively consistent with the prior year  as lower interest rates reduced both interest expense on our variable rate revolving credit facility and interest income on bank deposits 
the majority of capitalized interest during both and resulted from our plant expansion projects in europe and the construction of our new plastics plant in china 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in and million in  resulting in an effective tax rate of and  respectively 
we recorded tax provision benefits of million in the current year  the majority of which resulted from the expiration of open tax periods in various us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by changes in our business mix which resulted in a higher percentage of pretax income being generated in lower tax rate jurisdictions compared with the prior year 
during  we recognized tax credits of million resulting from the identification of additional qualified r d activities related to prior years  and other tax provision benefits of million primarily from the reversal of valuation allowances on prior year tax losses carried forward 
in  we also recognized a million net tax provision benefit principally resulting from the completion of a tax audit and the expiration of open tax periods in various tax jurisdictions 
our provision for income taxes was million  resulting in an overall effective tax rate 
in addition to the benefit of the items mentioned above  the effective tax rate was lower than the effective rate due to a larger amount of us foreign tax credits on taxes paid in certain foreign jurisdictions and increased development activities that qualified for r d tax credits 
our effective tax rate for the year ending december  is expected to be approximately  absent the impact of discrete tax items or legislative changes in tax rates 
as of december   we had million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 
it is reasonably possible that due to the expiration of statutes and the closing of tax audits  this liability for unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by approximately million during  which would favorably impact our effective tax rate 
equity in net income of affiliates equity in net income from our ownership interest in daikyo japan and our ownership interest in three mexican affiliates was million  million  and million for the years  and  respectively 
the majority of the and year over year increases were generated by daikyo as higher sales  gross profit and royalty income resulted in higher earnings 
daikyo s net income for was adversely affected by significant charges for plant demolition and pension plan termination costs 
purchases from affiliates totaled million in  million in and million in  the majority of which related to a distributorship agreement with daikyo which allows us to purchase and re sell daikyo products 
sales to affiliates were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations in was million  a decrease of million over diluted earnings per share in were  a decrease of per diluted share compared with the prior year earnings 
our results included the impact of restructuring charges and asset impairments of million net of million in tax  income from the reduction of acquisition related contingencies of million net of million in tax and the recognition of income tax benefits totaling million  the majority of which resulted from the reversal of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 

table of contents income from continuing operations in was million  a decrease of million over diluted earnings per share for were  a year over year decrease of per diluted share 
our results included the impact of restructuring charges and asset impairments of million net of million in tax and income tax benefits totaling million primarily relating to reversals of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and the identification of additional qualified r d activities related to prior years 
income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders in was million  or per diluted share 
our results included a net gain on contract settlement proceeds of million net of million in tax  restructuring and related charges of million net of million in tax  and income tax benefits of million  the majority of which related to the reversal of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash flow activity the following table and explanations provide cash flow data from continuing operations for the years ended december  in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities cash flows from operating activities our operating cash flows increased million compared to the prior year as a result of favorable variances in other assets and liabilities including lower cash paid for taxes in our operating cash flows increased million compared to the prior year 
the lower net income in  net of an increased amount of non cash charges such as depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation  was more than offset by favorable variances in other assets and liabilities including lower cash paid for taxes in compared with the prior year 
included in net cash provided by operating activities was a million voluntary contribution to our us qualified pension plan  compared with no contributions made during included in operating cash flow was a million payment for income tax and other tax related issues in brazil 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities was significantly lower than the amount as a result of lower capital spending and reduced spending on business acquisitions 
cash paid for business acquisitions in  which included the ris safety syringe acquisition  was million higher than cash paid for businesses acquired in capital spending in totaled million  which was a million decrease from the prior year due primarily to the completion of several significant capital projects 
packaging systems capital spending was million  a decrease of million from the prior year which was attributable to the third quarter completion of our new plastics plant in china  our european plants expansion project  and the implementation of new planning and manufacturing information systems in north america 
capital spending for the delivery systems segment was million  which was million below the level of spending in the prior year 
capital spending in totaled million  a million decrease from the amount 
packaging systems spending was million  a decrease of million from resulting from the completion of several major plant expansion projects that began during and were placed into service during in the aggregate  we spent million less for capital expansion projects in compared to  a portion of which was the result of discretionary reductions in spending as we postponed certain components of our expansion plans in response to the recessionary impacts on market demand 
also contributing to the decrease was a reduction in accrued capital spending 
delivery systems capital spending was million  an increase of million compared to the amount 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities the year over year increase in cash used for financing activities was primarily the result of a larger amount of debt repayments in compared to cash flows used in financing activities for included million in net repayment of borrowings and debt issue costs compared with combined net debt repayments of million in the majority of debt repayments in both years was attributable to borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
for  the year over year decrease in cash used for financing activities was the result of payments made in to acquire the remaining noncontrolling interest in our medimop subsidiaries  partially offset by a larger amount of debt repayment and higher dividend payments in compared to cash flows used in financing activities for included million in net repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and million in payments of short term notes and capital leases compared with combined net debt repayments of million in we paid cash dividends totaling million per share during  compared to million per share and million per share in and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the table below displays selected liquidity and capital measures for west as of december  in millions cash and cash equivalents working capital total debt cash equivalents include short term investments having maturities of ninety days or less when purchased 
working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities 
working capital at december  increased million compared with the balance at december   reflecting higher cash and cash equivalents of million and increased inventories in the amount of million  net of foreign currency effects 
the change in inventory balances was primarily due to higher raw materials costs  an increase in goods in transit due to timing of raw materials purchases from suppliers  and a year over year build in finished goods corresponding with higher orders on hand at december  compared with the prior year end 
included in working capital at december  and was cash held in escrow representing judicial deposits for the government of brazil related to various tax positions taken in prior years and the related tax liabilities 
the escrow balance recorded in other current assets at december  was million which will be used to settle our outstanding tax related obligations of million  also recorded within working capital 
as a result of the brazil tax amnesty program  we estimate that million in excess deposits will be returned to us as the underlying tax cases are settled 
in june  we entered into a four year multi currency revolving credit facility agreement  which replaced a prior revolving credit facility which was due to expire in the new credit agreement contains a million committed credit facility and an accordion feature under which the credit facility may be increased to million 
the interest rate is variable determined by reference to libor currently plus a margin ranging from to percentage points determined by our leverage ratio 
in june  we used borrowings of million under the new credit facility to repay all amounts outstanding under the prior credit agreement  which was then terminated 
as of december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under this new credit facility which was classified as long term debt based upon our intent and ability to continue the loans beyond one year 
during the fourth quarter  we had an average outstanding balance of million under our revolving credit facility 
total debt decreased million for the year as a result of repayments of million and from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of million 

table of contents based on our business outlook and our current capital structure  we believe that we have ample liquidity to fund our business needs  new product development  capital expansion  pension and other post retirement benefits and to pay dividends 
we may also use our liquidity from time to time to repay debt  fund acquisitions  repurchase shares for treasury and to make other investments 
we expect that our cash requirements for the next twelve months will be met primarily through our cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand  and amounts available under our multi currency revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had available million of borrowing capacity under this facility  and we have not experienced any limit on our ability to access this source of funds 
we are required by the financial covenants in our debt agreements to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios 
in addition  the agreements contain other customary covenants  none of which we consider restrictive to our operations 
as of the date of this report  we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments at december  these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity 
payments due by period in millions less than year to years to years more than years total purchase obligations long term debt interest on long term debt and interest rate swaps capital lease obligations operating lease obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations our business creates a need to enter into various commitments with suppliers 
in accordance with us gaap  these purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
these purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business 
for fixed rate long term debt  interest was based on principal amounts and fixed coupon rates at year end 
future interest payments on variable rate debt were calculated using principal amounts and the applicable ending interest rate at year end 
interest on fixed rate derivative instruments was based on notional amounts and fixed interest rates contractually obligated at year end 
includes capital lease obligations of million under an agreement we signed in december for the construction and lease of our new global headquarters building 
the construction will begin in early and is expected to be completed in january at december  this agreement had no long term debt associated with it since the lease term is not expected to begin until early we also have the option to purchase the building 
the total cost of purchasing the building would be based on actual construction and development costs incurred 
refer to note  subsequent event  for additional information 
represents acquisition related contingencies 
in connection with certain business acquisitions  we agreed to make payments to the sellers when and if certain operating milestones are achieved such as sales and operating income targets 
this table does not include obligations pertaining to pension and postretirement benefits because the actual amount and timing of future contributions may vary significantly depending upon plan asset performance  benefit payments  and other factors 
the minimum required contributions to our plans are expected to be million in refer to note  benefit plans  for estimated benefit payments over the next ten years 

table of contents reserves for uncertain tax positions the table above does not include million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately million of associated accrued interest as of december  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows  we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for amounts which may be paid 
letters of credit we have letters of credit totaling million supporting the reimbursement of workers compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers and to guarantee equipment lease payments in ireland and the payment of sales tax liabilities in the us the accrual for insurance obligations was million at december  off balance sheet arrangements at december   the company had no off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations  outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs and leased equipment  and sales tax liability guarantees  all incurred in the ordinary course of business 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions  some of which are subjective and complex  that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position revenue recognition the majority of our revenue within both segments is generated from product manufacturing operations and sales directly to our customers 
we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss passes to the customer which may be upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site  based upon shipping terms or legal requirements 
we offer volume rebates to certain customers as sales incentives 
provisions for rebates  as well as sales discounts and allowances  are accounted for as a reduction of sales when revenue is recorded 
we estimate rebates based on our assessment of the likelihood that required volumes will be attained using available information including historical experience 
we generally are able to ensure that products meet customer specifications prior to shipment 
we establish product return liabilities for customer quality claims when such liabilities are deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
impairment of long lived assets we review goodwill and other long lived assets annually and whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment as part of the reporting unit to which it belongs 
our reporting units are the same as  or one level below  our operating segments which are defined as the americas  europe and asia pacific divisions of the packaging systems segment and the americas and europe divisions of our delivery systems segment 
for assets held and used in the business  management estimates the future cash flows to be derived from the related asset or business unit 
when assets are held for sale  management determines fair value by estimating the anticipated proceeds to be received upon the sale of the asset  less disposition costs 
changes in the estimate of fair value  including the estimate of future cash flows  could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position 

table of contents employee benefits we maintain funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the us and a number of other countries that cover employees that meet eligibility requirements 
in addition  we sponsor postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or become disabled 
the measurement of annual cost and obligations under these defined benefit postretirement plans is subject to a number of assumptions  which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans 
the assumptions  which are reviewed at least annually  are relevant to both the plan assets where applicable and the obligation for benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees 
two of the most critical assumptions in determining pension and retiree medical plan expense are the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement age  rates of compensation increases  mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience 
for our funded plans  we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets  as well as historical and expected rates of return in estimating the long term rate of return on plan assets 
under us gaap  differences between actual and expected results are generally accumulated in other comprehensive income loss as actuarial gains or losses and subsequently amortized into earnings over future periods 
changes in key assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position 
we estimate that every basis point reduction in our long term rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by million  and every basis point reduction in our discount rate would increase pension expense by million 
a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations 
our net pension underfunded balance at december  was million compared to million at december  our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was million at december  and income taxes we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation 
in addition  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability  generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level 
changes in tax legislation  business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments  which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 
when accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements  we apply a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
please refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies and note  new accounting standards  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounting and reporting standards considered in the preparation and presentation of our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to various market risk factors such as fluctuating interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and increasing commodity prices 
these risk factors can impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
to manage these risks  we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  call options and forward exchange contracts for periods consistent with and for notional amounts equal to or less than the underlying exposures 
in accordance with company policy  derivative financial instruments are not used for speculation or trading purposes 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk we have subsidiaries outside the us accounting for over of consolidated net sales 
virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars for consolidated reporting purposes 
although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary  they may also hold assets or liabilities denominated in other currencies 
these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
as a result  our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing currency exchange rates 
we periodically use forward contracts to hedge certain transactions or to neutralize month end balance sheet exposures on cross currency intercompany loans 
we have designated our million euro denominated notes as a hedge of our investment in the net assets of our european operations 
we also have a billion yen denominated note payable which has been designated as a hedge of our investment in a japanese affiliate 
at december   a cumulative foreign currency translation loss on these net investment hedges of million net of tax of million was recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income 
interest rate risk as a result of our normal borrowing activities  we have long term debt with both fixed and variable interest rates 
long term debt consists of senior notes  convertible debentures  revolving credit facilities and capital lease obligations 
our exposures to fluctuations in interest rates are managed to the extent considered necessary by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
the following table summarizes our interest rate risk sensitive instruments in millions thereafter carrying value fair value current debt and capital leases euro denominated average interest rate fixed long term debt and capital leases us dollar denominated average interest rate variable us dollar denominated average interest rate fixed euro denominated average interest rate fixed yen denominated average interest rate variable as of december   we have two interest rate swap agreements outstanding which are designed to protect against volatility in variable interest rates payable on a million note maturing on july  series a note and a million note maturing july  series b note 
the first interest rate swap agreement has a notional amount of million and corresponds to the maturity date of the series a note and the second interest rate swap has a notional amount of million and corresponds with the maturity date of the series b note 
under each of the swap agreements we will receive variable interest rate payments based on three month libor in return for making quarterly fixed payments 
the interest rate swap agreements effectively fix the interest rates payable on our series a and b notes at and  respectively 
at december   the interest rate swap agreements had a fair value of million  unfavorable to the company  and were recorded as a noncurrent liability 

table of contents commodity price risk many of our packaging systems products are made from synthetic elastomers  which are derived from the petroleum refining process 
we purchase the majority of our elastomers via long term supply contracts  some of which contain clauses that provide for surcharges related to changes in crude oil prices 
in december  we purchased a series of crude oil call options  which were intended to reduce our exposure to increases in oil based surcharges and protect operating cash flows with regard to a portion of our forecasted elastomer purchases during the months of july through december these call options capped our cost of the crude oil component of elastomer prices for a portion of our forecasted purchases  allowing us to limit our exposure to increasing petroleum prices 
these call options were not designated as hedging instruments 
as of december   there were no options outstanding
