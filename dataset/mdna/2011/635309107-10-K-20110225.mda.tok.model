table of contents years ended december  and january  revenue 
total revenue of the company for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the period  an increase of million  or over the period 
the increase in total revenue was the result of an increase in total advertising revenue of including revenue from our founding member beverage concessionaire agreements  or beverage revenue and a increase in fathom events revenue 
national advertising revenues of million including million of beverage revenue for the year ended december  increased from million including million of beverage revenue of revenue for the period 
national advertising revenue excluding beverage revenue for the year ended december  increased million or to million compared to million for the period  primarily due to an increase in inventory utilization excluding beverage revenue to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended january  and a increase in advertising impressions available for sale 
the increase in inventory utilization was primarily due to the continued broadening of our overall client base 
the impact on revenue from inventory utilization and impressions was somewhat offset by a decrease in cpms due to a soft market television pricing environment 
the decrease in payments from the founding members for their beverage concessionaire agreements was primarily due to a reduction in the amount of beverage advertising time acquired by two of our founding members from to seconds  as compared to the seconds acquired during the year ended january   offset slightly by a contractual annual increase in beverage advertising cpm and the additional attendance increase associated with the consolidated theatres acquired by regal in the second quarter of local advertising revenue decreased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the period 
the decrease is primarily due to one less week in the fiscal year and the economic conditions present in and its effect on local and regional businesses 
local revenue per theatre attendee decreased slightly to per attendee for the full year of compared to for the period  due to the combination of slightly lower revenue coupled with a attendance increase across our network 
total advertising revenue per attendee for the year ended december  was per attendee  which represents a decrease of compared to the period 
the slight decrease in the advertising contract value per attendee was due to the impact of a increase in revenue versus a increase in theatre attendance  excluding beverage revenue  total advertising revenue per attendee increased fathom events revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the period 
this increase was due to continued growth in our fathom consumer events division offset by a decrease in our fathom business events division which was adversely impacted by the soft economy as larger corporate clients delayed their marketing and employee communication events 
our fathom consumer events business revenue benefited from the continued expansion of our live network capabilities and broadening of programming distributed over our theatre network  resulting in a increase in the consumer division s number of event locations 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the period 
the increase in compared to the period was primarily the result of an increase in advertising operating costs  fathom events costs  network costs and selling and marketing costs  which are primarily the result of the increase in our national advertising excluding beverage and fathom events revenues 
set forth below is a discussion of the more significant operating expenses 
advertising operating costs 
advertising operating costs of million for the year ended december  increased over the million for the period 
this increase was primarily 
table of contents the result of the increase in national advertising revenue excluding beverage resulting in an increase of in associated payments made to our advertising affiliates pursuant to our contractual agreements under which the payment is based on a percentage of revenue displayed in those theatres 
this is due to an increase of in advertising affiliate attendance 
the overall number of network affiliate screens decreased for as compared to  due to the loss of one advertising affiliate during network affiliate screens represented of total network screens for versus in fathom events operating costs 
fathom events operating costs of million for the year ended december  increased compared to million during the periods due to the increase in revenues associated with a increase in the number of events and the high level of variable event expenses associated with those events 
network costs 
network costs of million for the year ended december  increased compared to million for the period due primarily to the increase in size of our digital network and increased maintenance expenses related to aging network equipment in theatres 
total digital network screens operated during increased to  from  in  or an increase of approximately 
theatre access fees 
theatre access fees were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the period 
the increase for versus the period was the result of a increase in founding member attendance  including the addition of amc loews for the full year ended december  selling and marketing costs 
selling and marketing costs increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the period  or an increase of 
selling and marketing costs have increased primarily due to increases in personnel and operating costs of our online business as well as increased marketing initiatives to support our expanding business  an increase in bad debt expense primarily related to our local advertising business  offset slightly by a decrease in local sales commissions associated with lower sales revenues 
administrative and other costs 
administrative and other costs for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the period  an increase of primarily due to increased personnel costs  including share based compensation expense  partially offset by a decrease in professional fees  travel and other costs due to various cost savings efforts implemented by management during the year 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in compared to the period primarily as a result of increased depreciation on capital expenditures made to support the growth of our network  including network equipment installed in network affiliate theatres and amortization expense recognized on additional intangible assets associated with new founding member theatres added to our network in accordance with the common unit adjustment agreement 
net income 
net income generated for the year ended december  was million compared to net income for january  of million  primarily related to lower net interest expense offset by a higher provision for income taxes  an increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and a prior year impairment charge and charge for distributions to noncontrolling interests in excess of proportionate share of earnings 
the decrease in net interest expense is primarily due to a million non cash credit for the year ended december  as compared to a million non cash charge for the year ended january  in interest expense related to the change in fair value of our interest rate hedge of our senior secured credit facility due to the bankruptcy of lehman as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document  as well as lower market interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt 
for the year ended january   we had an million non operating impairment charge which related to our investment in a start up advertising company as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
the increase in income taxes is due to higher pre tax income and an increase in the effective state income tax rate 
the increase in the net amount attributable to noncontrolling 
table of contents interest is primarily due to the higher amount of income allocable to the noncontrolling interests in fiscal  caused by the items discussed above including the impact of additional common membership units issued in and by distributions to noncontrolling interest in excess of proportionate share of earnings of million recorded for the year ended january  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
known trends and uncertainties the current macro economic environment  and continued late breaking national television scatter advertising market in general  present uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  including the timing and amount of spending from our advertising clients and collections of accounts receivable 
however  we are cautiously optimistic that the impact to our business associated with these issues will not be significant due to factors including the growth in our advertising client base  the effectiveness of cinema advertising relative to other advertising mediums  and the effectiveness and increasing scale of our national network and the related increase in salable advertising impressions and fathom live broadcast locations 
as noted previously  in the fourth quarter of and during  we added several new affiliate theatres to our national network including galaxy theatres  llc  storyteller theatres corporation  starplex cinemas  showbiz cinemas  metropolitan theatres corporation  la live theatre  great escape theatres and rc theatres  and in mid we will add consolidated theatres and rave cinemas  llc  and theatres operated by showplex cinemas  inc in total  these additions will add nearly million new attendees on a full year pro forma basis  representing in excess of million new salable advertising impressions 
our sales force either has integrated or will integrate these additional impressions into the advertising sales process during and and we expect that the yield on these attendees to be additive to our revenue  operating income and cash flow 
we believe that the continued growth of our network will continue to strengthen our selling proposition and competitive positioning versus other national advertising platforms 
under the esas  up to seconds of the firstlook program can be sold to our founding members to satisfy their on screen advertising commitments under their beverage concessionaire agreements 
during and in  we sold seconds to our founding members 
we expect to continue to sell seconds of time to the founding members in and for the foreseeable future 
on may   a subsidiary of amc entertainment completed the acquisition of kerasotes showplace theatres  llc 
certain kerasotes theatres were later sold to regal 
these theatres and screens were included in our network since january under a network affiliate agreement with kerasotes showplace theatres  llc that terminated on may  these theatres and screens remain in our network and became part of our long term esa with amc as of the acquisition date 
on june   in accordance with the common unit adjustment agreement  ncm llc issued to a subsidiary of amc entertainment membership units related to the extraordinary attendance increase created by the acquisition 
the issuance of these units resulted in the company recording an intangible asset at fair value representing the contractual rights associated with the exclusive access to the net new theatre screens and attendance associated with the acquisition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
the addition of kerasotes to amc entertainment and regal did not increase our screen count or attendance as it represents a movement of the screens from a network affiliate revenue share structure to the esa theatre access fee and beverage revenue structure  however  the term of the agreement on these screens is now lengthened from the two years remaining on the existing kerasotes affiliate agreement to an approximate year term remaining on the esas 
we expect that the shift from the affiliate revenue share structure to the esa structure will increase the margins associated with these screens as  after the common unit adjustment  we expect our beverage revenue to increase and our affiliate expense to decrease  partially offset by increases in the theatre access fee and as a result our operating income should increase 
we remain involved in discussions with the founding member circuits to explore a restructuring of the fathom events business relationship 
the discussions are preliminary and we do not know how the existing 
table of contents relationship might be changed or if it will be changed 
any change to the fathom events business relationship with the founding members will require approval of our audit committee and a majority of our independent directors in addition to any other required approvals by our board of directors 
during the third quarter of  amc and regal completed an underwritten public offering of an aggregate  shares of the company s common stock 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
as a result  the company recorded a net step up in tax basis related to the investment in ncm llc of million 
in addition  we expect the accretion of interest on the discounted payable to founding members to increase approximately million in the company s increased ownership percentage in ncm llc as a result of this redemption is expected to proportionally reduce net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and increase net income attributable to ncm  inc our net income and earnings per share could fluctuate significantly with interest rate movements 
for example  the change in derivative fair value included in our results of operations increased  or million  to a million non cash charge for the year ended december  compared to a million non cash credit for the year ended december  due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
we believe these fluctuations are reasonably likely to continue 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note included elsewhere in this document 
our effective tax rate for the years ended december   december  and january  was  and  respectively 
during fiscal our effective tax rate included the effect of a valuation allowance 
our tax rate is affected by recurring items and the relative amount of income that ncm  inc earns in various state and local jurisdictions  which we expect to be fairly consistent in the near term 
it is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year  but are not consistent from year to year 
refer to note for additional details on our effective tax rate 
financial condition and liquidity liquidity and capital resources as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance was million  a decrease of million compared to the balance of million as of december  in addition  we had access to million on our revolver as of december  for a total liquidity position of million 
this increase in net cash balances relates primarily to a repayment of our revolving credit balance due to the restructuring of the lehman portion of the revolving credit balance as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this document

table of contents investing activities

the increase in cash used for investing activities for the year ended december  versus the period was primarily due to a decrease in the sale of short term investments offset by lower levels of capital expenditures 
the period included amounts for the purchase of equipment and related installation for certain network affiliate theatres 
financing activities 
the increase in cash used for financing activities for the year ended december  versus the period was due to an increase in repayments on borrowings on our revolving credit agreement  due to the restructuring of the revolving credit agreement as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in we expect to treat the revolving credit facility in a customary manner with regular borrowings and repayments as determined by our operating needs 
in addition  in we distributed additional available cash distributions to our founding members as well as additional cash disbursements for dividends to our stockholders as compared to  which were offset by net proceeds from share based compensation activities in the increase in cash used for financing activities for the year ended december  versus the period was primarily due to lower net proceeds from borrowings and higher available cash distributions to our founding members as defined in the operating agreement 
our cash balances will fluctuate due to the timing of collections of accounts receivable balances and operating expenditure payments  as well as available cash payments as defined in the ncm llc operating agreement to ncm llc s founding members  interest payments on our term loan and principal payments on debt  income tax payments  tax sharing payments to our founding members and quarterly dividends to ncm  inc s common stockholders 
sources of capital and capital requirements 
ncm  inc s primary source of liquidity and capital resources is available cash distributions from ncm llc 
ncm llc s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are its operating activities and availability under its senior secured revolving credit facility 
management believes that future funds generated from ncm llc s operations and cash on hand should be sufficient to fund working capital requirements  ncm llc s debt service requirements  and capital expenditure and other investing requirements  through the next months 
cash flows generated by ncm llc s distributions to ncm  inc and the founding members can be impacted by the seasonality experienced in advertising revenues and to a lesser extent theatre attendance 
ncm llc is required pursuant to the terms of its operating agreement to distribute its available cash  as defined in the operating agreement  to its members the founding members and ncm  inc 
the available cash distribution to the members of ncm llc for the year ended december  was million  of which million was distributed to ncm  inc ncm  inc 
will use cash received from the available cash distributions to fund income taxes  payments associated with the tax sharing agreement with the founding members and current and future dividends as declared by the board of directors  including a dividend declared in january of per share approximately million which will be paid on march  the company expects the available cash distributions to ncm  inc to increase proportionally with the increase in its ownership percentage in ncm llc due to the redemption of units by two of ncm llc s founding members in the third quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
distributions from ncm llc and ncm  inc cash balances should be sufficient to fund ncm  inc 
s tax sharing payments to the founding member circuits  income taxes and its regular dividend for the next months at the discretion of the board of directors dependent on anticipated cash needs  overall financial condition  future prospects for earnings  available cash and cash flows as well as other relevant factors 
capital expenditures

table of contents required for our noc and content production and post production facilities  office leasehold improvements  desktop equipment for use by our employees  and in certain cases  the costs necessary to digitize all or a portion of a network affiliate s theatres when they are added to our network 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million including million associated with network affiliate additions compared to million including million associated with network affiliate additions for the period 
the capital expenditures have typically been satisfied through cash flow from operations 
all capital expenditures related to the dcn within ncm llc s founding members theatres have been made by the founding members under the esas 
we expect they will continue to be made by the founding members in accordance with the esas 
we expect to make approximately million to million of capital expenditures in fiscal  primarily for upgrades to our digital content system  distribution software and our internal management systems  including our advertising inventory optimization  management and reporting systems  our internet site and network equipment related to currently contracted network affiliate theatres 
we expect these upgrades and improvements to our management reporting systems  which are intended to provide additional advertising scheduling and placement flexibility for our clients  should enhance our operating efficiencies  including allowing us to better manage our advertising inventory  and prepare us for continued growth 
our capital expenditures may be increased should we decide to add any additional network affiliates to our network 
we expect that additional expenditures  if any  would be funded in part by additional cash flows associated with those new network affiliates 
the commitments associated with our operating lease requirements are included in contractual and other obligations below 
we also expect depreciation and amortization to increase over due to the addition of the future common unit adjustment intangible assets 
financings senior secured credit facility 
on february   concurrently with the closing of the ipo of ncm  inc  ncm llc entered into a senior secured credit facility with a group of lenders 
the facility consists of a six year million revolving credit facility and an eight year  million term loan facility 
the net proceeds of the term loan were used  together with million of proceeds from the offering  to redeem all the preferred common membership units of ncm llc for an aggregate price of million 
the term loan will be due on the eighth anniversary of the funding 
the revolving credit facility portion is available  subject to certain conditions  for general corporate purposes of the company in the ordinary course of business and for other transactions permitted under the credit agreement  and a portion is available for letters of credit 
the obligations under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of ncm llc 
the outstanding balance of the term loan facility at december  was million 
the outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility at december  was million 
as of december   the effective rate on the term loan was including the effect of the interest rate swaps both those accounted for as hedges and those not

the weighted average interest rate on the unhedged revolver was 
commencing with the fourth fiscal quarter in fiscal year  the applicable margin for the revolving credit facility is determined quarterly and is subject to adjustment based upon a consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio for ncm llc and its subsidiaries the ratio of secured funded debt less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  over a non gaap measure defined in the credit agreement which is equivalent to adjusted oibda 
the senior secured credit facility also contains a number of covenants and financial ratio requirements  with which the company was in compliance at december   including the consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio of times in there are no distribution restrictions as long as the company is in compliance with its debt covenants

table of contents arrangements  as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
the company expects to remain in compliance with its covenants and financial ratio requirements as set forth in its credit facility for based on its budgets 
critical accounting policies the significant accounting policies of ncm llc are described in note of the financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  which management considers critical accounting policies 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates used by management are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and are evaluated on an ongoing basis 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of ncm llc 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in its trade receivables  which represent a significant asset on the balance sheet 
estimating the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of estimated losses based on historical loss experience  consideration of current economic trends and conditions and debtor specific factors  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
account receivable balances are charged against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged are credited to the allowance 
a provision for bad debt is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for bad debt could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
share based compensation 
the company s equity incentive plan is treated as an equity plan under the provisions of asc compensation stock compensation  and the determination of fair value of options for accounting purposes requires that management make complex estimates and judgments 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our options 
this model requires that the company make estimates of various factors used 
the following assumptions were used in the valuation of the options expected life of options the expected life of the options is determined by using the average of the vesting and contractual terms of the options the simplified method as described in sec staff accounting bulletin 
due to the short length of time over which our options have been outstanding  the company has not developed a historical option exercise experience and has determined that the simplified method is a reasonable basis to estimate the expected life of the options 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is determined by using the applicable treasury rates as of the grant dates  commensurate with the expected terms of the options 
expected volatility ncm closed its ipo on february  since the length of time our shares have been publicly traded is shorter than the contractual terms of our options  we believe historical volatility may not be completely representative of future stock price trends 
as a result  we estimate expected volatility based on comparable companies and industry indexes as well as on our historical volatility for stock price volatility 
dividend yield the estimated dividend yield was determined using management s expectations based on estimated cash flow characteristics and expected long term dividend policy 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc income taxes  which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax amounts are determined using the tax rates 
table of contents expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received  as provided under currently enacted tax law 
valuation allowances are to be established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we currently have a million valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not that we will not realize such assets in future periods as we do not expect offsetting capital gains 
in addition  due to the basis differences resulting from our ipo date transactions and subsequent adjustments pursuant to the common unit adjustment agreement  and entry into the tax receivable agreement with our founding members  we are required to make cash payments to the founding members in amounts equal to of our actual tax benefit realized from the tax amortization of the basis difference for certain deferred assets noted above 
the requirements of the tax receivable agreement  as amended  are highly technical and complex and involve management s judgment  including judgments to determine hypothetical tax outcomes exclusive of the ipo date transaction and agreements 
if we were to fail to meet certain of the requirements of the tax receivable agreement  we could be subject to additional payments to taxing authorities or to our founding members 
in addition  we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities

the value in this table represents the maximum potential payout under the revenue guarantees made by ncm llc to its network affiliates 
no revenue guarantee amounts have ever been paid under these agreements and no liabilities were recorded as of december  for additional details see the information provided under note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
the tax receivable agreement entered into at the completion of our ipo provides for the payment by us to the founding members of of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize as a result of certain increases in our proportionate share of tax basis in ncm llc s tangible and intangible assets 
the payments to the founding members are based  in part  on actual annual income and as such  will vary based on our operating results 
the value in the table represents the estimated amounts payable under the tax receivable agreement as of december  the amended and restated esas entered into at the completion of our ipo require payments based on a combination of founding member attendance and the number of digital screens of each founding member 
the amount relating to the attendance factor will vary from quarter to quarter and year to year as theatre attendance varies while the amount relating to the screens factor will be more predictable but will also vary quarter to quarter and year to year as screens are converted to digital screens and other screens are added or removed through acquisition  divestiture or closure activities of the founding members 
the payments made to founding members also will vary due to the escalation of the rates paid for each factor pursuant to the amended and restated esas 
the table above does not include amounts payable under the amended and restated esas as they are based on variable factors  which are not capable of precise estimation 
seasonality our revenue and operating results are seasonal in nature  coinciding with the attendance patterns within the film exhibition industry as well as the timing of marketing expenditures by our advertising clients 
advertising expenditures tend to be higher during the second  third  and fourth fiscal quarters and are correlated to theatre attendance levels and new product releases and advertising client marketing priorities and cycles 
the actual quarterly results for each quarter could differ materially depending on these factors or other risks and uncertainties 
based on our historical experience  our first quarter typically has less revenue than the other quarters of a given year due primarily to lower theatre industry attendance levels and lower advertising client demand 
accordingly  there can be no assurances that seasonal variations will not materially affect our results of operations in the future 
the following table reflects the quarterly percentage of total revenue for the fiscal years ended and first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fy fy

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
we have entered into variable to fixed interest rate swap arrangements economically hedging million of the million term loan at a fixed interest rate of 
the current interest rates on that debt are lower than those implicit in the hedge  thus a basis point fluctuation in market interest rates would have the effect of increasing or decreasing our cash interest expense by approximately million for an annual period on a total of million of unhedged debt which includes million outstanding on our revolver 
because each of our interest rate swaps was in a liability position at december   we are not currently exposed to counterparty risk related to the swaps
