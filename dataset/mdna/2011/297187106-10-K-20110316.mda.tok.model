during the years ended december   and  the company invested approximately million  million and million  respectively into new cranes and attachments for our rental fleet 
these investment decisions contributed greatly to the repositioning our fleet to maximize its utilization rates and average rental rates 
although we believe the repositioning of the fleet has maximized utilization rates and average rental rates  the economic downturn has significantly adversely impacted our business activity levels 
during the periods reported utilization rates of crawler cranes decreased to or  if calculated using the hits method in from or  if calculated using the hits method in on a pro forma basis  average crawler crane rental rates decreased to  in from  in on a pro forma basis  and average attachment rental rates decreased to  in from  in on a pro forma basis  and utilization rates of crawler crane attachments decreased to or if calculated using the hits method in from or if calculated using the hits method in on a pro forma basis

equipment repairs and maintenance expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase was related to cost incurred from the post acquisition operations of coast crane in yard operating expense decreased by to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the slight decrease was primarily related to lower average crane rental utilization

the following financial information provides a comparison of the company s results of operations for the year ended december  to the unaudited pro forma results of operations for the year ended december  as if we had acquired holdings and essex crane on january  management believes that such pro forma comparison provides a more meaningful comparison of our business s results of operations for the year ended december  the following unaudited pro forma operating results of our business are not intended to be  and not indicative of  the consolidated results of operations of the company that would have been reported had the acquisition of holdings and essex crane been completed as of the dates presented  and are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected going forward

the company also experienced a decrease in the average crane rental rate of to  per crane per rental month for the year ended december  relative to  on a pro forma basis for the year ended december  the slight decrease in the average rental rate is due to the expiration of rental agreements executed at higher rental rates in the prior year and new agreements being entered into at lower average rental rates 
as more rental agreements expire  we expect the average rental rates will continue to decline further in until utilization rates recover 
used rental equipment sales revenue  which represented of total revenue  was million for the year ended december   a decrease from pro forma used rental equipment sales revenue of million for the year ended december  these used equipment sales have presented essex with opportunities to further enhance its combination of cranes and attachments by providing an additional cash flow source for purchasing additional new rental equipment

transportation expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was related primarily to lower crane rental utilization 
equipment repairs and maintenance expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily related to lower crane rental utilization and also related to improved cost productivity and lower parts expense 
yard operating expense decreased by to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily related to lower crane rental utilization 
our gain on the sale of used rental equipment was million margin  calculated by dividing the gain on the sale divided by the revenue from such sale for the year ended december  compared to a pro forma gain of million margin for the year ended december  the lower level of gains on sales was due to the increase in book value of equipment driven by a higher relative asset basis resulting from the fair value acquisition accounting recorded on october  and also due to the lower levels of used equipment sales in the current period 
the pro forma gain on sale of equipment included in these pro forma financial results for the year ended december   presented consistently with that used in the company s definitive proxy statement  filed with the sec on october   will not be indicative of future results since the rental equipment was adjusted to fair value as of the closing date of the acquisition  thereby reducing potential future gains on sale

our coast crane subsidiary has three interest rate swap agreements in place with an aggregate notional amount of million that locks this portion of its debt based upon a fixed rate of 
management believes this cost of interest is more than sufficient to cover the rental revenue it generates since rental rates are established as a percentage of the values of the underlying equipment 
the weighted average interest rate on all debt obligations outstanding as of december  including the impact of the interest rate swaps was cash flow from operating activities the company s cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the purposes of this document are based upon our audited consolidated audited financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results  however  may materially differ from the calculated estimates and this difference would be reported in its current operations 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
our significant accounting policies are presented in note to our audited financial statements  and the following summaries should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the related notes thereto 
while all accounting policies affect the financial statements  certain accounting policies may be viewed as critical to us 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the financial statements and results of operations and that require our management s most subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
our management believes the policies that fall within this category are policies related to revenue recognition  rental equipment  impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  derivative financial instruments and income taxes 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue  including multiple element arrangements  in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance 
we generate revenue from the rental of cranes and related equipment and other services such as crane and equipment transportation and repairs and maintenance 
in many instances  the company provides some of the above services under the terms of a single customer equipment rental agreement 
the company also generates revenue from the retail sale of equipment and spare parts 
revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
the company is able to establish vendor specific objective evidence of selling price related to rental revenues after analysis of rental agreements absent any additional services offered by the company 
the company uses the estimated selling price for allocation of consideration to transportation services based on the costs associated with providing such services in addition to other supply and demand factors within specific sub markets 
the estimated selling prices of the individual deliverables are not materially different than the terms of the equipment rental agreements 
revenue from equipment rentals are billed monthly in advance and recognized as earned  on a straight line basis over the rental period specified in the associated equipment rental agreement 
rental contract terms span several months or longer 
because the term of the contracts can extend across financial reporting periods  when rentals are billed in advance  we defer recognition of revenue and record unearned rental revenue at the end of reporting periods so that rental revenue is included in the appropriate period 
repair service revenue is recognized when the service is provided 
transportation revenue from rental equipment delivery service is recognized for the drop off of rental equipment on the delivery date and is recognized for pick up when the equipment is returned to the essex crane service center  storage yard or next customer location 
new and used rental equipment and part sales are recognized upon acceptance by the customer and the execution of a definitive sales agreement stipulating the date risk ownership is transferred 
these policies are directly related to our cash flow and earnings 
there are estimates required in recording certain repair and maintenance revenues and also in recording any allowances for doubtful accounts 
the estimates have historically been accurate in all material respects and we do not anticipate any material changes to our current estimates in these areas 
useful lives of rental equipment essex s primary assets consist of its lattice boom crawler cranes and attachments  rough terrain cranes  tower cranes  boom trucks and other equipment within its fleet  which are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
in conjunction with the acquisitions of essex crane and coast crane  essex recorded all of its crane and attachment and other construction equipment fleet values at fair value 
essex depreciates the existing fleet over periods between and years on a straight line basis such that additions of new cranes to the fleet are depreciated over a year time period while used cranes acquired will be amortized over a period of to years 
essex s management reviews the value of its crane fleet annually in conjunction with its lenders 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memos 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of credit losses in accounts receivable and is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company periodically reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts and balances are written off against the allowance when management believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances  including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers 
accordingly  the company may be required to increase or decrease our allowance 
business combinations acquisition of holdings and essex crane on october   we acquired essex crane through the acquisition of substantially all of the ownership of holdings 
the purchase agreement provided for a gross purchase price of million  less the amount of essex crane s indebtedness outstanding as of the closing which was refinanced as of the closing date with a credit facility made available to essex crane as of the closing date  the million stated value of the membership interests in holdings not acquired in the acquisition and the amount of certain other liabilities of essex crane as of the closing of the acquisition 
the purchase price was subject to adjustment at and after the closing date based on essex crane s working capital as of the closing date and crane purchases and sales by essex crane prior to the closing date 
the adjusted purchase price of the holdings acquisition was million  including the amount of essex s indebtedness outstanding under essex crane s credit facility immediately prior to the closing 
for additional information regarding the gross purchase price paid in the acquisition of essex crane  including related transaction expenses  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the acquisition  excluding transaction costs was financed with approximately million of cash from the proceeds of the company s initial public offering  the million stated value of the membership interests in holdings not acquired in the acquisition and approximately million of assumption of essex crane s indebtedness outstanding as of the closing which was assumed and credit agreement amended as of the closing date 
in addition  as was required under the company s certificate of incorporation  shortly after completion of the acquisition approximately million of the proceeds of the company s initial public offering was paid to shareholders who voted against the acquisition of essex crane and exercised their conversion rights 
the ownership interests in holdings that were not acquired by the company in the acquisition were retained by the management members of holdings  including ronald schad  our chief executive officer  and martin kroll  our chief financial officer  and are referred to throughout this annual report as the retained interests 
the retained interests are exchangeable at the option of the holder for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
the retained interests do not carry any voting rights and are entitled to distributions from holdings only if the company pays a dividend to its stockholders  in which case a distribution on account of the retained interests will be made on an as exchanged basis 
holders of the retained interests have agreed  subject to certain exceptions  not to sell their retained interests in holdings or their shares of our common stock issuable upon exchange of such retained interests  before october  we have granted certain registration rights to the holders of the retained interests with respect to the shares of our common stock issuable upon exchange of the retained interests 
for additional information on our acquisition of essex crane and related transactions  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
purchase price in the acquisition the purchase price of the holdings acquisition was negotiated during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of and was agreed upon on march   the date the purchase agreement was signed 
the company based its purchase price negotiations on its estimates of the enterprise value of holdings  which in turn were based on holdings historical and projected revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  which were provided by the sellers 
the company s management and financial advisor determined that the purchase price was fair to the company from a financial point of view using three methodologies an analysis of expected discounted future cash flows  wherein the advisor applied a discount rate of to six years of forecasted ebitda to compute the fair value of essex crane s discounted future cash flows  an analysis of comparable public companies  wherein the advisor utilized the median ebitda and ebit multiple of eight publicly traded companies that the advisor and management believed were comparable to essex crane  and an analysis of comparable transactions  wherein the advisor utilized the median ebitda and ebit multiple from transactions the advisor and management believed were comparable to the holdings acquisition 
for additional information regarding the assumptions used to negotiate the purchase price and the analysis performed by our financial advisor  please see the sections of essex s definitive proxy statement  filed with the commission on october   entitled the acquisition proposal background of the acquisition beginning on page and the acquisition proposal fairness opinion beginning on page 
the company s management continued to believe that the negotiated purchase price was fair as of the october  closing date given the financial results of holdings through september   which were consistent with the projections evaluated by the company s management and the financial advisor that provided a fairness opinion when originally analyzing the enterprise value of holdings and negotiating the purchase price 
under the terms of its initial public offering  the company s initial business combination was required to be with a business whose fair market value was at least equal to of the company s net assets on the acquisition date 
the fairness opinion obtained by the company s board of directors in connection with the acquisition included an opinion that the fair market value of holdings satisfied the test  based on the maximum net asset value of the company  which the financial advisor determined to be approximately million based on the company s book value as of september  of approximately million and approximately million in contingent capital representing the aggregate exercise price of the company s outstanding warrants that would become exercisable following the closing of a business combination  which had not significantly changed as of the acquisition date 
the purchase price excluding transaction costs the fair market value of the acquired company of million was well in excess of million of million  the maximum value of the acquiring company 
goodwill impairment subsequent to essex crane acquisition in goodwill of  was recorded associated with the acquisition of holdings on october  for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed 
the goodwill was subsequently determined to be impaired as of december  upon review of information up until the date the financial statements were issued and was written off in full 
as required by applicable accounting guidance  the company was required to consider various triggering events that could indicate that its fair value had fallen below its book value as of december  which could result in the recognition of an impairment loss 
management determined that the decline in its stock price from on october   the date of the acquisition  to at december  was a triggering event that required further analysis 
the decline in stock price resulted in the company s market capitalization being less than the book value of equity for the month of december  which management considered an extended period of time 
as such  the company engaged an experienced and qualified third party to assist management in performing a valuation of goodwill using management s assumptions discussed below 
the company  as required by applicable accounting guidance  considered all financial information available through february in refining its assumptions used to perform the valuation including its declining revenues  gross margin  a declining backlog and other financial information in determining its forecast of future revenues  gross margin  ebitda and ebit 
these forecast assumptions were significantly worse than those utilized in determining the purchase price in march which management also considered appropriate as of the october  acquisition date due to the rapidly declining economy and the credit crisis during november and december which continued into the first quarter of at which time it began negatively affecting our business 
in addition to reduced forecast assumptions  there was also a decline in other market based measures  including the ebitda median multiple of comparable public companies  which were brought on by the rapidly declining economy and credit crisis 
a valuation of the company was prepared for goodwill impairment analysis purposes using the following methodologies an analysis of expected discounted future cash flows  wherein a discount rate of was applied to five years of forecasted future cash flows to compute the fair value of essex s discounted future cash flows  and an analysis of ebitda multiples calculated using an estimated enterprise value based on financial information for comparable public companies  wherein an ebitda multiplier was used for seven publicly traded companies that the advisor and management believed were comparable to essex 
the average ebitda estimates for the comparable five year period used in the discounted cash flow valuation for the goodwill impairment evaluation were lower than those used for the fairness opinion 
also  the ebitda multiple derived from the estimated enterprise value of comparable public companies used for the goodwill impairment evaluation decreased approximately from the acquisition date value used in the fairness opinion 
based on the results of the valuation performed  and in conjunction with the significant decreases in the metrics used in the valuation  the fair value of the equity of the company s single reporting unit was estimated at approximately million  compared to book value of equity of approximately million 
as a result  the company performed a step impairment analysis 
since the book value of equity exceeded its fair value by more than the amount of the goodwill recorded at december   all of the goodwill was deemed to be impaired resulting in a loss of approximately million recognized in the company s statement of operations for the year ended december acquisition of coast crane s assets on november   the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of washington approved an asset purchase agreement the coast crane purchase agreement between cc bidding  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company  and coast crane  a delaware corporation pursuant to which cc bidding agreed to purchase substantially all of the assets including the tradename  and also of the outstanding shares of capital stock of coast crane ltd  and assume certain liabilities  of coast crane the coast crane acquisition 
coast crane  a leading provider of specialty lifting solutions and crane rental services on the west coast of the united states  filed a voluntary petition for relief under the united states bankruptcy code on september  case number 
the coast acquisition was completed on november  the primary reasons for the company s acquisition of coast crane s assets are as follows broaden the company s product offerings to encourage customers to utilize the company s expanded product offerings for their heavy lifting construction equipment needs with an ability to leverage customer relationships between the operating subsidiaries while providing for cross selling opportunities  extend the company s geographic footprint to the western and northwestern us  alaska  hawaii  guam and the south pacific  provide new revenue streams from the distribution of new and used equipment and diversifying revenue streams from a larger mix of equipment allowing for more consistent earnings through economic cycles  and providing an opportunity for the company to obtain a significant pool of rental equipment assets in one transaction as well as a highly trained workforce with significant construction equipment expertise 
it would have taken significantly longer and would have been more expensive had the company built this platform from the ground up 
the components of the total consideration transferred of million  which includes settlement of certain liabilities in accordance with the bankruptcy proceedings  by cc bidding for the purchase of coast crane s assets is as follows cash consideration cash from proceeds of common share issuance cash from essex rental corp 
cash from proceeds from new revolving credit facility total cash transferred at close plus transaction expenses paid outside of close less transaction expenses total cash consideration liabilities assumed unsecured promissory note canadian revolving credit facility purchase money security interest debt interest rate swap agreements trade payables accrued benefits and employee compensation total liabilities assumed per the purchase agreement total consideration transferred the allocation of total consideration transferred to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows assets acquired cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable other receivables equipment inventory retail spare parts prepaid expenses and other assets rental equipment property and equipment loan acquisition costs assumed identifiable intangible assets goodwill total assets acquired liabilities assumed other accounts payable accrued taxes accrued other expenses unearned revenue and customer deposits deferred tax liabilities total other liabilities assumed foreign currency exchange impact net assets acquired the methodology in allocating the total consideration transferred to acquire the assets of coast crane of million  to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is described below as follows the book value of other current assets  accounts payable and accrued liabilities were determined to approximate their fair value due to their short term nature  certain amounts related to income taxes remain subject to adjustment and will be finalized during the measurement period  accounts receivables were recorded at their estimated fair values based on expected collectability 
the gross contractual receivables of accounts and other receivables as of the date of acquisition were approximately million 
managements best estimate of the gross accounts receivable not expected to be collected is million  an experienced and qualified third party assisted in the valuation of the company s rental equipment and property and equipment using the cost and market approaches based in part on assumptions provided by management  an experienced and qualified third party assisted in the valuation of intangible assets including customer relationship intangible and trademark and spare parts inventory using the income approach based in part on assumptions provided by management  and the remaining excess purchase price paid over the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill all of which will be deductible for tax purposes 
goodwill includes the value of the assembled workforce and synergies created through the coast acquisition 
the following table contains the amounts of revenues and earnings of cc bidding included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  for the period november  to december  total revenues gross profit loss from operations net loss income taxes the company uses an asset and liability approach  as required by the applicable accounting guidance for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those assets and liabilities are expected to be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that the change in tax rates is enacted 
management makes certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax credits and in the calculation of the deferred income tax expense or benefit associated with certain deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to essex rental s tax provision in a subsequent period 
management assesses the likelihood that it will be able to recover its deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  the company will increase its provision for income taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that are unlikely to be recovered 
the company follows the applicable accounting guidance related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
the company files income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in most state jurisdictions 
the company is subject to us federal or state income tax examinations for years through and coast crane ltd is subject to canadian income tax examinations for the tax years through essex management makes certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax credits and in the calculation of the deferred income tax expense or benefit associated with certain deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to essex s tax provision in a subsequent period 
at december   the company had unused us federal net operating loss carry forwards totaling approximately million that begin expiring in at december   the company also had unused state net operating loss carry forwards totaling approximately million that expire between and impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value 
losses related to long lived assets are recorded where indicators of impairment are present and the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset rental and associated revenues less related operating expenses plus any terminal value are less than the assets carrying value 
if the carrying value of the assets will not be recoverable  as determined by the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value of the assets is reduced to fair value 
essex  under the terms of its credit agreement  engages an independent third party to help management appraise the value of the crane and attachment fleet on at least an annual basis 
we consider a number of factors including value in use for crane and attachment rental  secondary market values and possible values in alternate use 
derivative financial instruments essex uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations on its revolving credit facility with the objective of converting a targeted amount of its floating rate debt to a fixed rate 
the company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes  and therefore holds no derivative instruments for trading purposes 
essex believes that the use of derivatives in the form of interest rate swaps is an important tool to manage its balance sheet liabilities and interest rate risk  while protecting its associated rental margins 
the company sets its equipment rental rates based in part as a percentage of the investment cost of the equipment and then uses the interest rate swap to lock in the associated interest costs of a period of time 
recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements please refer to note within our notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the fact that interest on our revolving credit facilities is calculated based upon either libor or prime rate plus an applicable margin as of december  for which we have an interest rate swaps to effectively fix the interest rate at on million of the million of outstanding borrowings under essex crane s senior secured credit facility and three undesignated interest rate swaps to effectively fix the interest rate at on million of the million of outstanding borrowings under coast crane s senior secured credit facility 
the weighted average interest rate in effect on all of the company s borrowings at december  was excluding the impact of the interest rate swaps and taking into consideration the swaps 
a increase in the effective interest rate on our total outstanding borrowings including our short term debt obligations not effectively fixed as a result of the interest rate swap at december  would increase our interest expense by approximately million on an annualized basis 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
see also note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 
the fair values of the company s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their carrying values based on their nature and terms 
the fair value of the company s total debt outstanding as of december  was million  excluding the impact of our interest rate swaps 
if market rates of interest increased basis points due to a change in the applicable margin rate of interest a increase from the company s current margin the estimated fair value of the company s total debt obligations would be approximately million 
if market rates of interest decreased basis points due to a change in the applicable margin rate of interest a decrease from the company s current margin the estimated fair value of the company s total debt obligations would be approximately million 
the company s interest rate swaps had a liability fair value of approximately million as of december  if market rates of interest permanently increased by basis points  the fair value of the company s interest rate swap would result in a million liability 
if market rates of interest permanently decreased by basis points  the fair value of the company s interest rate swap would be a million liability 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s financial instruments 
theses analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in the overall economy that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of changes of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure or results 
the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and  therefore  the company cannot predict its exposure to market risk 
consequently  further results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above
