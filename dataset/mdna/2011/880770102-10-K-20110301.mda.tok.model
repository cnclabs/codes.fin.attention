overview we are a leading global supplier of automatic test equipment 
we design  develop  manufacture  and sell automatic test systems and solutions used to test complex electronics in the consumer electronics  automotive  computing  telecommunications  and aerospace and defense industries 
our automatic test equipment products and services include semiconductor test semiconductor test systems  and military aerospace mil aero test instrumentation and systems  hard disk drive test hdd systems  circuit board test and inspection commercial board test systems and automotive diagnostic and test diagnostic solutions systems  collectively these products represent systems test group 

table of contents we have a broad customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers idms  outsourced sub assembly and test providers osats  wafer foundries  fabless companies that design  but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits ics  manufacturers of circuit boards  automotive companies  hdd manufacturers  aerospace and military contractors as well as the united states department of defense 
the sales of our products and services are dependent  to a large degree  on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products 
these cyclical periods have had  and will continue to have  a significant effect on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor industry 
historically  these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations 
this was particularly relevant beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year where we saw a significant decrease in revenue in our semiconductor test business which was impacted by the deteriorating global economy  which negatively impacted the entire semiconductor industry 
the sharp swings in the semiconductor industry in recent years have generally affected the semiconductor test equipment and services industry more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector 
commencing in the fourth quarter of  we experienced improvement in our semiconductor test business 
we believe our acquisitions of nextest and eagle test and our entry into the high speed memory and hdd markets have enhanced our opportunities for growth 
we will continue to invest in our business to expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs 
as demonstrated  with our current cost structure  we can achieve significantly higher profitability than we achieved at comparable revenue levels in the past 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
preparation of financial statements and use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  investments  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  bad debts  income taxes  deferred tax assets  pensions  warranties  contingencies  and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing non software and software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
in october  the fasb also amended the accounting standards for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of our first quarter of on a prospective basis 
adoption had no material impact on our financial position or results of operations in we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  title and risk of loss have passed  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and 
table of contents collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point 
in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination  acceptance or cash payment  we defer revenue recognition until such events occur 
our equipment has non software and software components that function together to deliver the equipment s essential functionality 
revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point  provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment 
certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications  which are generally conducted prior to shipment 
where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received 
we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance  which represents deferred profit 
for multiple element arrangements  we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  a hierarchy is used to determine the selling price for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price besp 
for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit  the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control 
our post shipment obligations include installation  training services  one year standard warranties  and extended warranties 
installation does not alter the product capabilities  does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors 
installation is typically provided within five days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter 
training services are optional and do not affect the customers ability to use the product 
we defer revenue for the selling price of installation and training 
extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
our products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized 
we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue 
service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed 
we generally do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products 
for transactions involving the sale of software  revenue is recognized in accordance with asc  software revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
in instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements  revenue related to the undelivered elements is deferred to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe exists for such elements 
in instances where vsoe does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement  all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered 
vsoe is the price charged when the element is sold separately 
revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element 
for certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under asc  revenue recognition construction type and production type contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs 
these arrangements require significant production  modification  or customization 
in all cases  changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
with respect to contract change orders  claims or similar items  judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured  generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order 

table of contents inventories inventories  which include materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
on a quarterly basis  we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value 
we record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such write downs or write offs are identified through the quarterly review process 
the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand  product mix  and possible alternative uses 
equity incentive and stock purchase plans stock based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc as required by asc  we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stock based compensation awards expected to vest 
on may   our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain outstanding  unvested out of the money stock options awarded to employees  officers  and other eligible participants under our various stock option plans in effect at that time 
the stock options that were accelerated had exercise prices that were in excess of  the closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on may   and ranged in exercise price from to per share 
as a result of the vesting acceleration  options to purchase approximately million shares became exercisable immediately  and we reduced the compensation expense we otherwise would have been required to record under asc by approximately million in the aggregate  on a pre tax basis  over fiscal years  and income taxes on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assess the need for a valuation allowance 
as a result of this review  undertaken at december   we concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions  most notably the united states 
due to the continued uncertainty of realization  we have maintained our valuation allowance at december  and we will assess the level of the valuation allowance required in future periods 
should more positive than negative evidence regarding the realizability of tax attributes exist in a future period  the valuation allowance may be reduced or eliminated altogether 
reduction of the valuation allowance  in whole or in part  would result in a non cash income tax benefit during the period of reduction 
investments we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of asc  investments debt and equity securities 
on a quarterly basis  we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential other than temporary impairment 
factors considered in determining whether a loss is other than temporary include the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we determined that we did not intend to hold certain marketable securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery in market value and recognized an other than temporary impairment loss in the amount of million and million  respectively  in the years ended december  and  primarily related to mortgage and asset backed debt securities 

table of contents as a result of our november  acquisition of eagle test  we acquired million of auction rate securities ars at fair value million par value 
in addition  we acquired the right ubs put to sell our ars back to ubs at par plus interest  at our sole discretion  during a two year period beginning on june   and received an option to borrow up to of the fair value of the ars at no cost 
we classified the ars as trading securities under asc the ars portfolio was repurchased by ubs in and we no longer own any ars securities 
on november   we also recognized the ubs put as an asset measured at a fair value of million 
the ubs put was exercised in june at december   the fair value of the ubs put was million 
during  we recorded a million loss in interest expense for the decrease in the fair value of the ubs put 
during  we recorded million gain in interest income for an increase in the fair value 
goodwill  intangible and long lived assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets  and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks 
we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter  on a reporting unit basis  or more frequently  when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
we considered the significant adverse change in the business climate for our products at the end of a triggering event for testing the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long lived assets 
based upon a review of the operations and activities associated with our long lived assets  we determined that our long lived assets should be grouped with other assets and liabilities and identified four asset groups system on a chip high speed memory  nextest  eagle test and assembly test that resulted in the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows were largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we identified developed technology as the primary asset for the nextest and eagle test asset groups  test system fixed assets as the primary asset for the system on a chip high speed memory asset group  and fixed assets as the primary asset for the assembly test asset group 
we tested the recoverability of our asset groups by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group to the asset group s carrying amount 
the projections utilized in the undiscounted cash flows to test the recoverability of the asset groups were consistent with the underlying projections utilized in our goodwill impairment evaluation  except that the undiscounted cash flows included only the future cash flows directly associated with the direct use and eventual disposition of the asset group 
the sum of the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amount of the asset groups and  as a result  the carrying amount of asset groups was deemed recoverable 
as a result  no impairment loss was recognized 
no impairment indicators were present in or

retirement plans we adopted the funded status recognition provision of asc  compensation retirement benefits defined benefit plans effective december  asc requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by asc the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plan s assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december for other postretirement benefit plans  the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december our pension expense  which includes the us qualified pension plan us plan  certain qualified plans for us subsidiaries  and a us supplemental executive defined benefit plan  was approximately million for the year ended december  the largest portion of our pension expense was million for our supplemental executive defined benefit plan 
pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  a significant input to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations 
discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense and asset liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis 
we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors  such as retirement age  mortality and turnover periodically  and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 
in developing the expected return on us plan assets assumption  we evaluated input from our investment managers and pension consultants  including their review of asset class return expectations 
based on this review  we believe that was an appropriate rate to use for we will continue to evaluate the expected return on plan assets at least annually  and will adjust the rate as necessary 
the december  asset allocation for our us plan is invested in fixed income securities  invested in equity securities  and invested in other securities 
the february  asset allocation for our us plan is invested in fixed income securities  invested in equity securities and invested in other securities 
our investment managers regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations 
we base our determination of pension expense or benefit on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return on assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized 
as of december   under the us plan  we had cumulative losses of approximately million  which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us plan is based on the citigroup pension index adjusted for the us plan s expected cash flows and was at december   down from at december  we estimate that in we will recognize approximately million of pension expense for the us plan 
the us plan related pension expense estimate for is based on a discount rate  and return on us plan assets 
future pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans 
as of december   we had unrecognized pension losses and prior service costs of million  of which million is for the us plan 

table of contents we performed a sensitivity analysis  which expresses the potential change in our us plan expense for the year ending december   that would result from changes to either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets

during  we made a discretionary contribution of million to the us plan  million contribution to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and million contribution to certain qualified plans for non us subsidiaries

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents  marketable securities  forward currency contracts and accounts receivable 
our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in us treasuries and government agencies 
our fixed income available for sale marketable securities have a minimum rating of aa by one or more of the major credit rating agencies 
we place forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable 
exchange rate risk management we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in euro  british pound  japanese yen and the taiwan dollar 
these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of approximately one month 
these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures 
we do not engage in currency speculation 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of december   and  the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate risk management we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
our interest rate exposure is primarily in the united states in short term and long term marketable securities 
in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk  a fluctuation in interest rates was assumed 
market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio 
the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is immaterial as of december  and
