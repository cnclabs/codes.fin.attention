item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which we refer to as md a  of cenveo  inc and its subsidiaries  which we refer to as cenveo  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  which we refer to as the form k 
certain statements we make under this item constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of see cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements in item and risk factors in item a 
introduction and executive overview we are one of the largest diversified printing companies in north america  according to the december printing impressions report 
we operate a global network of strategically located manufacturing facilities  serving a diverse base of over  customers 
the united states printing industry is highly fragmented  with a broad range of sectors  including commercial printing and envelope converting  labels and forms manufacturing among others 
we believe the printing industry has excess capacity and will continue to be highly competitive 
our business strategy has been and continues to be focused on pursuing strategic acquisitions  improving our cost structure  providing a diverse quality product offering portfolio to our customers and maintaining reasonable levels of financial flexibility 
we believe this strategy has allowed us to diversify our revenue base  maintain our low cost producer focus and deliver quality product offerings to our customers over the past five years 
we continue to selectively review acquisition opportunities that will allow us to grow in niche markets  broaden our product offerings and increase our economies of scale 
our acquisition strategy is focused on product expansion into highly complimentary niche businesses or expanding our presence in the current markets in which we operate today 
over the past five years we have completed twelve acquisitions that either provided us entry into new highly complementary print related markets or expanded our existing print or envelope manufacturing platform 
we believe our focused approach to acquisitions should allow us to grow at a faster pace than the broader commercial printing industry 
we intend to continue practicing our acquisition disciplines and pursuing opportunities that allow for greater expected profitability and cash flows or improved operating efficiencies 
we believe that our manufacturing platform  strategically located facilities and our industry experienced management team enables us to continuously seek improvements to our operating margins 
we continue to pursue cost savings measures in an effort to align our cost structure with our anticipated revenues and mitigate the impact of pricing pressures 
we work closely with our vendors with a focus on supply chain enhancements that lower our input costs and improve our operating margins 
our acquisitions along with our cost savings and restructuring plans have allowed us to mitigate the need for significant capital expenditures by realigning our most efficient equipment throughout our manufacturing platform while maintaining a reasonable level of financial flexibility during the extended economic uncertainty 
our continued approach to review our cost structure could require additional plant closures  consolidations and employee headcount reductions throughout our operating platform 
our broad portfolio of products includes commercial printing  envelope production  forms and labels manufacturing  packaging and publisher offerings 
many of our customers focus on price as a key decision driver 
we believe that given the extended economic uncertainty  our customers will continue to focus on price 
in addition  certain of our key customers have recently provided us the opportunity to become a single source supplier for all of their printed product needs 
this trend benefits our customers as they seek to leverage their buying power and helps us improve operating efficiencies in our plants with increased throughput in multiple product lines via a single customer relationship 
our financial flexibility depends heavily on our ability to maintain relationships with existing customers  attract new financially viable customers and maximize our operating profits  all of which are vital to our ability to service our current debt level 
our level of indebtedness  which requires significant principal and interest payments  could potentially impact our ability to reinvest cash flows from operations into our business via capital expenditures or niche acquisitions 
we therefore closely monitor working capital  including the credit we extend to and the collections we receive from customers as well as inventory levels and vendor pricing  while continuously seeking out pricing and manufacturing improvements to increase our cash flow 
see part item of this form k for a more complete description of our business 
outlook we believe that the mild recovery we experienced in from the economic downturn will continue in we believe our efforts to reduce our operating cost structure  which we began implementing at the beginning of the economic downturn  allowed us to mitigate significant impacts to our operating performance and to our business over the past two years 
the envelope and print industries are highly competitive and significantly fragmented 
as a result of those factors as well as with the impact of the economic downturn  we have seen significant attrition in our competition during  which we believe we were able capitalize on for our future benefit 
in  we anticipate higher net sales as compared to primarily due to i our acquisitions  ii our february acquisition of epg  iii anticipated increases in direct mail volume  iv anticipated increases derived from pricing as a result of material cost increases  and v anticipated increases in sales volumes as a result of a mild recovery related to the general economic conditions 
we anticipate increased operating margin performance in as compared to  excluding the impact of restructuring  impairment and other charges 
we believe this improvement will be facilitated by i the incremental operating efficiencies provided by the acquisitions and epg  ii our continued focus on being a low cost producer and iii anticipated increases in net sales combined with our lower cost structure 
our debt refinancing activities  which included refinancies in february and december  improved our capital structure and extended our scheduled debt maturities 
these refinancing activities extended our maturities on approximately million of our outstanding long term debt and provided more favorable financial covenants 
our next scheduled debt maturity is in when our million senior subordinated notes  which we refer to as the notes  come due and payable 
we believe that the completion of these refinancing activities will allow for greater focus on our operating results in consolidated operating results this md a includes an overview of our consolidated results of operations for  and followed by a discussion of the results of each of our reportable segments for the same period 
our results of operations for the year ended include the operating results of the acquisitions  subsequent to their respective acquisition dates 
our results of operations for the year ended include the operating results of nashua subsequent to its acquisition date of september  our results of operations for the year ended include the operating results of rex  subsequent to its acquisition date on march  segment performance overview during  our envelopes  forms and labels segment was impacted by i disruption in the traditional envelope and direct mail envelope markets as a result of exacerbated pricing pressures in the envelope converting marketplace due to a significant competitor entering and reemerging from bankruptcy combined with higher raw material costs  ii increased unit volume for our direct mail envelope customers  primarily financial institutions  as compared to  iii overall decline in the traditional documents and forms marketplace and pricing pressures resulting from customers continued and improved abilities to print high quality documents on their own  and iv improved performance of our labels business due to general improvement in the economy as compared to during  our commercial printing segment was impacted by i significant revenue and operating margin decline in our stm journals business  which has lagged the economic downturn due to customer committed print requirements  and ii improved performance in our commercial print and specialty packaging businesses due to general improvement in the economy as compared to cost savings  restructuring and acquisition overview the completion of our cost savings initiatives coupled with our integration initiatives in connection with our acquisition of nashua in and our acquisitions included a reduction of approximately employees and the closure or consolidation of three manufacturing facilities in we have completed the integration of nashua into our existing manufacturing platform and have achieved our targeted synergies 
in november of  we completed the acquisition of gilbreth 
gilbreth utilizes specialized printing technologies as a manufacturer and marketer of full body shrink sleeves and tamper evident neck bands 
we believe the acquisition of gilbreth will allow us to internally produce product that we historically had to purchase from an outsourced partner 
additionally  we expect that gilbreth will enable us to provide additional cross selling opportunities to our existing customer base 
we believe that the integration efforts related to gilbreth are minimal and we expect to be completed with those efforts in early in may of  we completed the acquisition of glyph  which we believe will enhance our content management operations 
we expect to be complete with the integration of glyph in and believe we are on target to achieve our anticipated synergies 
in february of  we completed the acquisition of clixx 
clixx has provided our canadian print operations with end of production capabilities that were previously unavailable to those operations 
debt refinancing activities in february of  we completed a partial debt refinancing  which we refer to as the refinancing  that included an amendment to our revolving credit facility due  which we refer to as the revolving credit facility  and our term loans and delayed draw term loans due  which we refer to as the term loans  which collectively with the revolving credit facility we refer to as the amended credit facilities  and the issuance of million senior second lien notes due  which we refer to as the notes 
this refinancing extended maturities on approximately one quarter of our total debt and provided us with immediate liquidity through the elimination of all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
in december of  we refinanced the remaining amended credit facilities  which we refer to as the credit facility refinancing 
our new million senior secured credit facility consists of a million revolving credit facility due  which we refer to as the revolving credit facility  and a million term loan due  which we refer to as the term loan b  which collectively with the revolving credit facility we refer to as the credit facilities 
this refinancing extended the maturity of approximately one quarter of our total debt and enhanced our liquidity by extending the maturity of our existing revolving credit facility 
goodwill and intangible asset impairments during the third quarter of  given the continued economic uncertainty that remained in the united states and global economies and revisions to our forecasted operating results  primarily in our publisher services group  which is part of the commercial printing segment and which we refer to as our psg reporting unit  we believed that there were sufficient indicators that would require us to perform an interim goodwill and long lived asset impairment analysis as of october  as a result of our goodwill and long lived asset impairment analysis  we recorded non cash  impairment charges of million related to goodwill and million related to other long lived assets  of which million related to an indefinite lived tradename and million related to customer relationships within our psg reporting unit 
we believe that these charges primarily resulted from reductions in the estimated fair value of this reporting unit due to i higher discount rates applied to lower estimated future cash flows as compared to our prior year analysis and ii continued economic uncertainty  which has increased customer cost awareness resulting in continued price pressures  lower page counts  and a shift from historical web and sheet fed print products to lower cost digital print products 
a summary of our consolidated statement of operations is presented below 
the summary presents reported net sales and operating income loss 
see segment operations below for a summary of net sales and operating income loss of our operating segments that we use internally to assess our operating performance 
our reporting periods for  and consisted of  and week periods  respectively  ending on the saturday closest to the last day of the calendar month and ended on january   january  and january   respectively 
we refer to such periods herein as i the year ended  ii the year ended  and iii the year ended all references to years and year ends herein relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years

the increased sales for our envelopes  forms and labels segment primarily resulted from the integration of nashua into our operations  as nashua was not included in our results for a full year during the decrease in sales within our commercial printing segment was due to volume declines  changes in product mix and lower material costs  primarily due to the extended economic uncertainty that we experienced during  and lost sales resulting from plant closures as part of our restructuring plans 
these decreases to our commercial printing segment were partially offset by sales from the acquisitions  as the acquisitions were not included in our results in see segment operations below for a more detailed discussion of the primary factors for the changes in net sales by reportable segment 
net sales for decreased million  as compared to  due to lower sales from our commercial printing segment of million and from our envelopes  forms and labels segment of million 
these decreases were primarily due to volume declines  changes in product mix and lower material costs  primarily due to the general economic conditions that we experienced during including pricing pressures and lost sales resulting from plant closures as part of our restructuring plans 
these declines were partially offset by increased sales generated from our envelopes  forms and labels segment from the integration of nashua into our operations  as nashua was not included in our results in see segment operations below for a more detailed discussion of the primary factors for the changes in net sales by reportable segment 
operating income operating income in  excluding the non cash goodwill and other long lived assets impairment charges of million in our commercial print segment  increased million  as compared to this increase was primarily due to higher operating income for our commercial printing segment of million and our envelopes  forms and labels segment of million 
these increases were primarily due to an increase in gross margins and a decrease in restructuring and impairment charges resulting from cost savings initiatives taken to mitigate the general economic conditions 
see segment operations below for a more detailed discussion of the primary factors for the changes in operating income by reportable segment 
operating income  excluding the non cash goodwill impairment charges of million for our commercial print and envelope reporting units  decreased million in  as compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower operating income for our commercial printing segment of million and our envelopes  forms and labels segment of million 
these declines were primarily due to the general economic conditions that we experienced during and increased restructuring and impairment charges resulting from cost savings initiatives taken to mitigate the general economic conditions 
see segment operations below for a more detailed discussion of the primary factors for the changes in operating income by reportable segment 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million in  from million in the increase was primarily due to higher interest rates resulting from i the april amendment to our amended credit facilities  which we refer to as the amendment  and ii the refinancing 
interest expense in reflected average outstanding debt of approximately billion and a weighted average interest rate of  compared to the average outstanding debt of approximately billion and a weighted average interest rate of in we expect interest expense in to be lower than largely due to the maturity of our interest rate swap agreements 
interest expense decreased million to million in  from million in  primarily due to our lower debt balances resulting from i the repurchase and retirement of a portion of our senior subordinated notes due  which we refer to as the notes  senior notes due  which we refer to as the notes  and the notes  and ii the repayment of a portion of term loans  primarily from a mandatory excess cash flow payment made in march the decrease in interest expense was partially offset by higher interest rates resulting from the amendment 
interest expense in reflected average outstanding debt of approximately billion and a weighted average interest rate of  compared to the average outstanding debt of approximately billion and a weighted average interest rate of in gain loss on early extinguishment of debt 
during  in connection with our credit facility refinancing  we incurred a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million of which million related to fees paid to consenting lenders and million related to the write off of previously unamortized debt issuance costs 
in connection with the refinancing  we incurred a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million of which million related to fees paid to consenting lenders and million related to the write off of previously unamortized debt issuance costs 
in  we recognized net gains on early extinguishment of debt of million  comprising of gains of million from the repurchase and retirement of principal amounts of million of our notes  million of our notes  and million of our notes 
these gains were partially offset by the loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the amendment of million  of which million related to fees paid to consenting lenders and million related to the write off of previously unamortized debt issuance costs 
in  we i repurchased million of our notes and million of our notes  and recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of million  and ii converted our million senior unsecured loan due  which we refer to as the senior unsecured loan  into our notes  and recognized a million loss on early extinguishment of debt 
income taxes years ended in thousands income tax expense benefit for us operations income tax expense benefit for foreign operations income tax expense benefit effective income tax rate in  we had an income tax benefit of million  which primarily related to income tax benefits from our non cash impairment charges related to goodwill and other long lived assets and the reversal of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as well as taxes on our domestic operations 
our effective tax benefit rate during was lower than the federal statutory rate  primarily due to the non deductibility for income tax purposes of the non cash impairment charges related to goodwill and other long lived assets 
we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly in the next twelve months 
we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and  to the extent recoverability does not satisfy the more likely than not recognition criteria under asc  income taxes  record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we consider all positive and negative evidence in evaluating our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets  including our operating results  ongoing tax planning  and forecast of future taxable income  on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
significant judgment is required with respect to the determination of whether or not a valuation allowance is required for certain of our deferred tax assets 
we considered the fact that we have reported a cumulative loss in recent years  which generally provides negative evidence regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets 
however  such cumulative losses mainly resulted from the goodwill impairment and restructuring related charges recorded over the last three years 
a substantial majority of the goodwill impairment charges had no impact on taxable income as these charges primarily are non deductible 
we performed an analysis of the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets as of january  deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards did not reach the more likely than not realizability criteria and accordingly  were subject to a valuation allowance 
during  our valuation allowance was reduced by million  consisting of a reduction related to our state net operating loss carryforwards 
we analyzed the remaining net deferred tax assets using all positive and negative evidence to determine whether we met the more likely than not recognition criteria 
we believe that such remaining net deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable based primarily on the weight of positive evidence provided by our tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income  including restructuring related charges and our historical results of operations excluding impairment charges related to non deductible goodwill 
however  in the circumstance that the financial projections are not achieved  our ability to realize these net deferred tax assets may be significantly impacted 
in  we had an income tax benefit of million  which primarily relates to the tax benefit on our domestic operations 
our effective tax benefit rate in was lower than the federal statutory rate  primarily due to non deductible expenses  offset in part by state tax benefits 
the non deductible expenses primarily relate to stock based compensation expense resulting from a difference in tax deductions available to us based on the market price of our stock based compensation at the time of exercise as compared to our recorded stock based compensation expense 
if we generated pre tax income  this would cause our effective income tax rate to be higher than our statutory federal rate 
in  we had an income tax benefit of million  which primarily relates to the million income tax benefit recorded in connection with the non cash goodwill impairment charges  offset in part by taxes on our domestic operations 
our effective tax benefit rate in was lower than the federal statutory rate  primarily due to non deductible goodwill impairment charges  offset in part by state tax benefits 
the non deductible goodwill impairment charges accounted for a reduction to the effective tax benefit rate of approximately 
income from discontinued operations  net of taxes 
income from discontinued operations for primarily related to the reduction of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions of million  net of deferred tax assets of million  as a result of the expiration of certain statute of limitations on uncertain tax positions related to the supremex income fund  which we refer to as the fund 
income from discontinued operations for primarily relates to the reduction of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions of million  net of deferred tax assets of million  as a result of the expiration of certain statute of limitations on uncertain tax positions related to the fund

envelopes  forms and labels years ended in thousands segment net sales segment operating income loss operating income loss margin items included in segment operating income restructuring and impairment charges segment net sales segment net sales for our envelopes  forms and labels segment increased million  or  in  as compared to this increase was primarily due to i million of sales generated from the integration of nashua into our operations  including the impact of work transitioned from our existing operations to nashua  as nashua was not included in our results for a full year in  and ii higher sales volumes of approximately million due to increased unit volumes from our envelope customers  primarily our financial institution customers  offset in part by the loss of sales from three plant closures in and our decision to exit certain lower margin transactional business within our envelope operations 
these increases were offset in part by lower sales of million from price and product mix changes  primarily due to pricing pressures on our office products business as a result of the continued general economic conditions and our business forms operations  primarily resulting from an overall decline in the traditional documents and forms marketplace and pricing pressures resulting from customers continued and improved abilities to print high quality documents on their own  which are being offset in part by our ability to pass along material price increases to our customers over time 
segment net sales for our envelopes  forms and labels segment decreased million  or  in  as compared to this decrease was primarily due to i lower sales volume of million  primarily due to the general economic conditions  which has had a significant impact on our envelope business  for which we have seen a shift from direct mail and customized envelopes to generic transactional envelopes and lost sales in connection with the closure of three envelope plants and one forms plant that were integrated into our existing operations  and ii lower pricing and product mix of million  primarily due to pricing pressures in the current envelope marketplace and lower material costs 
these decreases were partially offset by million of sales generated from the integration of nashua into our operations  as nashua was not included in our results in segment operating income loss segment operating income for our envelopes  forms and labels segment increased million or in  as compared to this increase was primarily due to i increased gross margins of million primarily due to gross margins generated from nashua  as nashua was not included in our results for a full year in  and lower fixed costs resulting from three envelope plant closures in  and ii lower restructuring and impairment charges of million 
these increases were offset in part by i higher selling  general and administrative expenses of million primarily due to nashua  as nashua was not included in our results for a full year in  partially offset by our cost savings initiatives  and ii higher amortization expense of million  primarily due to amortizable intangible assets relating to nashua  as nashua was not included in our results for a full year in segment operating income for our envelopes  forms and labels segment  excluding the non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  decreased million or in  as compared to this decrease was primarily due to i lower gross margins of million  primarily due to the general economic conditions  which has resulted in increased pricing pressures  lower sales volume and product mix changes from high color direct mail envelopes to transactional envelope products  partially offset by lower material costs and increased gross margins from nashua  as nashua was not included in our results for  and ii increased restructuring and impairment charges  excluding the non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  of million  primarily due to the closure of three envelope plants and one forms plant

corporate expenses include the costs of running our corporate headquarters 
corporate expenses were lower in  as compared to  primarily due to lower stock based compensation offset in part by higher restructuring and impairment charges from our cost savings initiatives 
corporate expenses were lower in  as compared to  primarily due to lower stock based compensation expense 
restructuring  impairment and other charges 
we have three active and two residual cost savings  restructuring and integration plans i the plans related to the integration of the nashua and glyph acquisitions and the cost savings and restructuring plan  and ii the cost savings and integration plan and the cost savings and restructuring plan 
as a result of these cost savings actions  over the last five years we have closed or consolidated a significant number of manufacturing facilities including  three manufacturing facilities in  and have had a significant number of headcount reductions  including approximately employees in we continue to pursue additional cost savings opportunities in an effort to mitigate any further potential impact on our operations from the continued general economic conditions and have begun formulating our integration plan related to epg 
therefore  we expect to incur further restructuring and integration charges in as of the year ended  our total restructuring liability was million  of which million is included in other current liabilities and million  which is expected to be paid through  is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
during  we incurred million of restructuring and impairment charges  which included million of employee separation costs  asset impairments  net of million  equipment moving expenses of million  lease termination expenses of million  multi employer pension withdrawal expenses of million and building clean up and other expenses of million 
also during  we recorded non cash impairment charges of million related to goodwill and million related to other long lived assets  of which million related to an indefinite lived tradename and million related to customer relationships in our psg reporting unit 
during  we incurred million of restructuring and impairment charges  which included million of employee separation costs  asset impairment charges  net of million  equipment moving expenses of million  lease termination expenses of million  pension withdrawal liability of million and building clean up and other expenses of million 
during  we incurred million of restructuring  impairment and other charges  which included a million non recurring charge for professional fees related to the internal review initiated by our audit committee  million of employee separation costs  asset impairment charges  net of million  equipment moving expenses of million  lease termination expenses of million  pension withdrawal income of million and building clean up and other expenses of million 
during the fourth quarter of  our reporting units experienced declines in their net sales  gross profit and operating income on a comparable basis with the third quarter of historically  the fourth quarter has been our strongest quarter for net sales  gross profit and operating income for our reporting units 
as a result  we recorded non cash impairment charges of goodwill of million and million related to our commercial print and envelope reporting units  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  which was primarily due to our net loss adjusted for non cash items of million and a decrease in working capital of million 
the decrease in our working capital primarily resulted from a decrease in accounts payable due largely to the timing of payments to our vendors and an increase in inventory due to the timing of work performed for our customers  offset significantly by an increase in other working capital primarily due to the timing of interest payments on our long term debt and a decrease in receivables primarily due to the timing of collections from and sales to our customers 
cash provided by operating activities is generally sufficient to meet daily disbursement needs 
on days when our cash receipts exceed disbursements  we reduce our revolving credit balance or place excess funds in conservative  short term investments until there is an opportunity to pay down debt 
on days when our cash disbursements exceed cash receipts  we use our invested cash balance and or our revolving credit balance to fund the difference 
as a result  our daily revolving credit balance fluctuates depending on working capital needs 
the refinancing and notes issuance resulted in the elimination of nearly all of our revolving credit facility balances and thereby substantially increasing our liquidity position  which we may utilize for future acquisitions or debt repayments 
regardless  at all times we believe we have sufficient liquidity available to us to fund our cash needs 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  which was primarily due to our net loss adjusted for non cash items of million and a decrease in our working capital of million 
the decrease in our working capital primarily resulted from a reduction in inventories due to the timing of work performed for our customers and a decrease in receivables due to lower sales volume and the timing of collections from and sales to our customers  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable due to lower sales volume and the timing of payments to our vendors and accrued compensation liabilities primarily due to lower employee headcount 
net cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  primarily resulting from million of cash consideration for the acquisitions and capital expenditures of million  offset in part by million of proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
our debt agreements limit capital expenditures to million in plus any proceeds received from the sale of property  plant and equipment and  if certain conditions are satisfied  any unused permitted amounts from we estimate that we will spend approximately million on capital expenditures in  before considering proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
our primary sources for our capital expenditures are cash generated from operations  proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment  and financing capacity within our current debt arrangements 
these sources of funding are consistent with prior years funding of our capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  primarily from capital expenditures of million and cost of business acquisitions of million for nashua  offset by million of proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment and million of proceeds from the sale of an investment 
net cash provided by used in financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily due to i cash proceeds from issuance of the notes  net of the original issuance discount  of million  and ii cash proceeds from issuance of the term loan b of million  net of original issuance discount  offset in part by i the repayment of term loans of million and million  net pay down of our revolving credit facility in connection with the refinancing  ii payment of fees and expenses of million in connection with the issuance of the notes  the refinancing and the credit facility refinancing  and iii repayments of other long term debt of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  primarily resulting from i aggregate payments of million related to the repurchase and retirement of million  million and million of our notes  notes and notes  respectively  ii the repayment of million of term loans  primarily related to our march mandatory excess cash flow payment  iii the repayment of million of other long term debt  and iv the payment of million in fees and expenses for the amendment  offset in part by the proceeds of net borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility 
contractual obligations and other commitments 
the following table details our significant contractual obligations and other commitments as of january  in thousands payments due long term debt operating leases other total thereafter total includes million of estimated interest expense over the term of our long term debt  with variable rate debt having an average interest rate of approximately 
includes pension and other postretirement benefit payments of million  anticipated worker s compensation paid losses of million  restructuring related liabilities of million  including interest expense on lease terminations and multi employer pension withdrawal liabilities  derivative liabilities of million  and purchase commitments for equipment of million 
excluded from the table are million income tax contingencies as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount payable or timing of settlement 
long term debt 
our total outstanding long term debt  including current maturities  was approximately billion as of the year ended  an increase of million from this increase was primarily due to i the acquisitions  ii the issuance of our notes  offset by repayments of our term loans and iii fees and expenses paid related to the refinancing and the credit facility refinancing 
as of the year ended  approximately of outstanding debt was subject to fixed interest rates 
as of march   we had approximately million borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility 
credit facilities and debt compliance on december   we entered into the credit facilities 
the proceeds of the credit facility refinancing were used to refinance our existing amended credit facilities 
the credit facilities extended the maturity of approximately one quarter of our total debt and enhanced our liquidity by extending the maturity of the revolving credit facility 
proceeds from the credit facilities together with available cash were used to repay the outstanding term loans  accrued interest thereon and to pay fees and expenses incurred related to the credit facilities 
the term loan b was issued at a discount of million  of which substantially all remains unamortized as of the year ended borrowing rates under the credit facilities are selected at our option at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on london interbank offered rate libor or the prime rate publicly announced by bank of america  na from time to time  in each case plus a specified interest rate margin 
with respect to the term loan b  libor based borrowings will not have an interest rate of less than per annum plus an applicable margin of per annum  and prime rate borrowings will not have an interest rate of less than per annum plus an applicable margin of per annum 
we also pay a commitment fee on unused revolving loan commitments of per annum 
all revolving loans mature on december   and the term loan b amortizes in quarterly installments equal to per year  commencing march   with the remaining principal balance due at maturity on december   in each case subject to certain conditions that could result in an earlier maturity 
the credit facilities contain certain restrictions that  among other things and with certain exceptions  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  prepay subordinated debt  transfer assets outside of cenveo  pay dividends or repurchase shares of common stock 
the credit facilities also contain customary financial covenants  including a maximum consolidated leverage covenant  a maximum consolidated first lien leverage covenant and a minimum consolidated interest coverage covenant 
all three of these financial covenants were reset as a result of the credit facilities 
the consolidated leverage covenant threshold  with which we must be in pro forma compliance at all times  now requires us not to exceed at any time during fiscal year  then steps down in increments beginning in the second quarter of until we reach during the third quarter of our fiscal year and remains at that level for the remainder of the term 
the consolidated first lien leverage covenant now requires us to not exceed through the second quarter of  then steps down to and remains at that level for the remainder of the term 
the consolidated interest coverage covenant now requires us to not be less than through the fourth quarter of  then steps up incrementally  reaching in and remains at that level for the remainder of the term 
the obligations under the credit facilities are guaranteed by us and each existing and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiary of cenveo 
the credit facilities are secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all assets of cenveo and our domestic subsidiaries 
as the credit facilities have senior secured and first priority lien position in our capital structure and the most restrictive covenants  then provided we are in compliance with the credit facilities  we would also be in compliance  in most circumstances  with our debt incurrence tests within all of our indentures 
any default under the credit facilities would prevent us from borrowing additional amounts and could cause the indebtedness outstanding under the credit facilities and  by reason of cross acceleration or cross default provisions  all of the aforementioned notes and any other indebtedness we may then have  to become immediately due and payable 
as of the year ended  we were in compliance with all debt agreement covenants 
we anticipate being in compliance with all debt agreement covenants through the fiscal year ended notes issuance on february   we issued our million notes that were sold with registration rights to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with rule a under the securities act of  and to certain non united states persons in accordance with regulation s under the securities act of the notes were issued at a discount of approximately million  of which approximately million remains unamortized as of the year ended net proceeds after fees and expenses were used to pay down million of our term loans and million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the notes were issued pursuant to an indenture among cenveo  inc  certain subsidiary guarantors and wells fargo bank  national association  as trustee  and an intercreditor agreement among cenveo  inc  certain subsidiary guarantors  bank of america  na  as first lien agent and control agent  and wells fargo bank  national association  as second lien collateral agent 
the notes pay interest semi annually on february and august  commencing august  the notes have no required principal payments prior to their maturity on february  the notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by cenveo  inc and substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries with a second priority lien on substantially all of the assets that secure the amended credit facilities  and on a senior unsecured basis by substantially all of our canadian subsidiaries 
as such  the notes rank pari passu with all our senior debt and senior in right of payment to all of our subordinated debt 
we can redeem the notes  in whole or in part  on or after february   at redemption prices ranging from to approximately  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in addition  at any time prior to february   we may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes originally issued with the net cash proceeds of certain public equity offerings 
we may also redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of notes per twelve month period before february  at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  and redeem some or all of the notes before february  at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the redemption date  plus a make whole premium 
each holder of the notes has the right to require us to repurchase such holder s notes at a purchase price of of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon  upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the indenture that constitute a change in control 
the notes contain covenants  representations  and warranties substantially similar to our notes  including a consolidated secured debt to consolidated cash flow liens incurrence test 
in order to fulfill our registration rights obligations  on april   we launched a registered exchange offer  which we refer to as exchange offer  to exchange any and all of our outstanding unregistered notes for publicly tradable notes having substantially identical terms and guarantees  except that the exchange notes will be freely tradable 
the exchange offer expired on may   and nearly all unregistered notes were exchanged for registered notes 
letters of credit as of the year ended  we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million and a de minimis amount of surety bonds related to performance and payment guarantees 
based on our experience with these arrangements  we do not believe that any obligations that may arise will be significant 
credit ratings our current credit ratings are as follows rating agency corporate rating credit facilities notes notes notes notes outlook last update moody s b ba b caa caa caa negative december standard poor s b bb b ccc ccc ccc stable december in december  moody s investors services  which we refer to as moody s and standard poor ratings services  which we refer to as standard poor s  lowered our corporate rating and the ratings on our credit facilities  notes  notes  notes and notes in conjunction with the credit facility refinancing  and the detail of our current ratings have been provided in the table above 
the terms of our existing debt do not have any rating triggers that impact our funding availability or influence our daily operations  including planned capital expenditures 
we do not believe that our current ratings will unduly influence our ability to raise additional capital if and or when needed 
some of our constituents closely track rating agency actions and would note any raising or lowering of our credit ratings  however  we believe that along with reviewing our credit ratings  additional quantitative and qualitative analyses must be performed to accurately judge our financial condition 
we expect that our internally generated cash flows and financing available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs through our fiscal year  however  this cannot be assured 
off balance sheet arrangements 
it is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
accordingly  as of the years ended and  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting matters the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from estimates 
we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for losses on accounts receivable 
we maintain a valuation allowance based on the expected collectability of our accounts receivable  which requires a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the current creditworthiness of customers and related aging of past due balances 
as of the years ended and  the allowance provided for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable was million and million  respectively 
charges for bad debts recorded to the statement of operations were million in  million in and million in we cannot guarantee that our current credit losses will be consistent with those in the past 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the allowance for losses required for uncollectible accounts receivable 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out or average cost basis 
cost includes materials  labor and overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories 
if there were to be a significant decrease in demand for our products  we could be required to reduce our inventory balances accordingly 
provision for impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of specific assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
when an evaluation is required  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the specific asset or group of assets 
if the cost of the asset or group of assets cannot be recovered by these undiscounted cash flows  we would assess the fair value of the asset or asset group and if necessary  an impairment charge would be recorded 
our estimates of future cash flows are based on our experience and internal business plans 
our internal business plans require judgments regarding future economic conditions  product demand and pricing 
during  and  in connection with our restructuring and integration programs  we recorded non cash impairment charges  net on long lived assets of million  million and million  respectively 
our non cash impairment charges include a million non cash impairment charge related to customer relationships within our psg reporting unit  which is part of our commercial printing segment 
although we believe our estimates are appropriate  significant differences in the actual performance of an asset or group of assets may materially affect our evaluation of the recoverability of the asset values currently recorded 
additional impairment charges may be necessary in future years 
provision for impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually at the beginning of december and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred 
accounting standards codification asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  prescribes a two step method for determining goodwill impairment 
in the first step  we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value  step two is completed to determine the amount of the impairment loss 
step two requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets  including any unrecognized intangible assets  and liabilities in a hypothetical purchase price allocation 
any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to the corresponding carrying value of goodwill to compute the goodwill impairment amount 
as part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit  we estimate the fair value of each unit  primarily using the income approach 
the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit  including projected future operating results  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  discount rates  and the allocation of shared service or corporate items 
the market approach was used as a test of reasonableness of the conclusions reached in the income approach 
the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping 
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer group companies  control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete  the discount rate  terminal growth rates  and forecasts of net sales  operating income  depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures 
the allocation requires several analyses to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including  among others  trade names  customer relationships  and property  plant and equipment 
although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable  actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates 
changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units  the amount of the goodwill impairment charge  or both 
we also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to our total enterprise value as implied by the market value of our equity securities 
this comparison indicated that  in total  our assumptions and estimates were not unreasonable 
however  future declines in the overall market value of our equity securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below their carrying value 
in  we recorded non cash goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges of million  of which million related to goodwill and related to an indefinite lived tradename in our psg reporting unit  which is part of our commercial printing segment 
in we did not record any goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges 
in  we recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges of million and million related to our commercial print and envelope reporting units  respectively 
one measure of the sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment charges to key assumptions is the amount by which each reporting unit had fair value in excess of its carrying amount or had carrying amount in excess of fair value for the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
in  the three reporting units had fair value in excess of carrying value with fair value exceeding carrying value by at least 
generally  changes in estimates of expected future cash flows would have a similar effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
that is  a change in estimated future cash flows would decrease the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by approximately 
of the other key assumptions that impact the estimated fair values  most reporting units have the greatest sensitivity to changes in the estimated discount rate 
in  the discount rate for each reporting unit was estimated to be 
a basis point increase in our estimated discount rates would not have resulted in any additional reporting units failing step one 
determining whether an impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets has occurred requires an analysis of the fair value of each of the related tradenames 
however  if our estimates of the valuations of our tradenames prove to be inaccurate  an impairment charge could be necessary in future periods 
our annual impairment analysis for trade names utilizes a relief from royalty method in which the hypothetical benefits of owning each respective trade name are valued by discounting hypothetical royalty revenue over projected revenues covered by the trade names 
we utilized royalty rates of to for the use of the subject trade names based on comparable market rates  the profitability of the product employing the trade name  and qualitative factors  such as the strength of the name and years in usage 
we utilized a discount rate of  which was based on the weighted average cost of capital for the respective business plus a premium to account for the relative risks of the subject trade name 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations for all of our indefinite lived trade names  we applied hypothetical and decreases to the estimated fair value of our trade names 
such hypothetical decreases in fair value could be due to changes in discount rates and or assumed royalty rates 
these hypothetical and decreases in estimated fair value would not have resulted in an impairment of any of our identifiable indefinite lived trade names other than our colorgraphics trade name  which has a carrying amount of million 
the hypothetical estimated fair value for our colorgraphics trade name would not have exceeded its carrying amount by approximately million at a decrease to its estimated fair value 
self insurance reserves 
we are self insured for the majority of our workers compensation costs and health insurance costs  subject to specific retention levels 
we rely on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insurance claims 
while we believe that the estimates of our self insurance liabilities are reasonable  significant differences in our experience or a significant change in any of our assumptions could materially affect the amount of workers compensation and healthcare expenses we record on an annual basis 
our self insurance workers compensation liability is estimated based on reserves for claims that are established by a third party administrator 
the estimate of these reserves is adjusted from time to time to reflect the estimated future development of the claims 
our liability for workers compensation claims is the estimated total cost of the claims on a fully developed and discounted basis that considers anticipated payment patterns 
as of the years ended and  the undiscounted liability was million and million  respectively  and the discounted liability was million and million  respectively  using a discount rate 
our self insured healthcare liability represents our estimate of claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the years ended and we rely on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries to determine an adequate liability for self insured plans 
this liability was million as of the years ended and  respectively  and was estimated based on an analysis of actuarial completion factors that estimated incurred but unreported liabilities derived from the historical claims experience 
the estimate of our liability for employee healthcare represents between and days of unreported claims 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery has occurred  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
since a significant portion of our products are customer specific  it is common for our customers to inspect the quality of the product at our facilities prior to shipment 
products shipped are not subject to contractual right of return provisions 
we record sales net of applicable sales tax and freight costs that are included in the price of the product are included in net sales while the costs of delivering finished goods to customers are recorded as freight costs and included in cost of sales 
accounting for income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate  which primarily includes the united states  canada and india 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded an expense in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax items that have been deducted for tax purposes  but have not yet been recorded as an expense in our consolidated financial statements 
as of the years ended and  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively  from our united states operations 
the change in united states net deferred taxes is primarily due to an increase in our tax loss carryforward that can be used to offset taxable income in future years as well as the deferred tax benefit recorded in connection with our goodwill and intangible impairment charges 
as of the years ended and we had foreign net deferred tax liabilities of million and million  respectively 
we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and  to the extent recoverability does not satisfy the more likely than not recognition criteria under asc  income taxes  record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we consider all positive and negative evidence in evaluating our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets  including our operating results  ongoing tax planning  and forecast of future taxable income  on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
significant judgment is required with respect to the determination of whether or not a valuation allowance is required for certain of our deferred tax assets 
we considered the fact that we have reported a cumulative loss in recent years  which generally provides negative evidence regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets 
however  such cumulative losses mainly resulted from the goodwill impairment and restructuring related charges recorded over the last three years 
a substantial majority of the goodwill impairment charges had no impact on taxable income as these charges primarily are non deductible 
we performed an analysis of the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets as of january  deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards did not reach the more likely than not realizability criteria and accordingly  were subject to a valuation allowance 
during  our valuation allowance was reduced by million  consisting of a reduction related to our state net operating loss carryforwards 
we analyzed the remaining net deferred tax assets using all positive and negative evidence to determine whether we met the more likely than not recognition criteria 
we believe that such remaining net deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable based primarily on the weight of positive evidence provided by our tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income  including restructuring related charges and our historical results of operations excluding impairment charges related to non deductible goodwill 
however  in the circumstance that the financial projections are not achieved  our ability to realize these net deferred tax assets may be significantly impacted 
we recognize a tax position in our consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
this recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final outcome of uncertain tax positions may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
we adjust such reserves upon changes in circumstances that would cause a change to the estimate of the ultimate liability  upon effective settlement or upon the expiration of the statute of limitations  in the period in which such event occurs 
during  we reduced our liabilities for uncertain tax positions by million as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations 
additionally  during  we reduced our liabilities for uncertain tax positions by million as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
we record annual amounts relating to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates  anticipated rates of return  compensation increases and current expected mortality rates 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so 
the effects of modifications are recognized immediately on our consolidated balance sheet  but are generally amortized into our consolidated statement of operations over future periods  with the deferred amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on our experience  market conditions and input from our actuaries and investment advisors 
we determine our assumption for the discount rate to be used for purposes of computing annual service and interest costs based on the citigroup pension liability index as of our respective year end dates 
the weighted average discount rate for pension and other postretirement benefits was and for the years ended and  respectively 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rates at year end would increase the pension and other postretirement plans projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rates at the year ended would decrease the pension and other postretirement plans projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
our investment objective is to maximize the long term return on the pension plan assets within prudent levels of risk 
investments are primarily diversified with a blend of equity securities  fixed income securities and alternative investments 
equity investments are diversified by including united states and non united states stocks  growth stocks  value stocks and stocks of large and small companies 
fixed income securities are primarily united states governmental and corporate bonds  including mutual funds 
alternative investments are primarily private equity hedge funds and hedge fund of funds 
we consult with our financial advisors on a regular basis regarding our investment objectives and asset performance 
new accounting pronouncements we are required to adopt certain new accounting pronouncements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
commitments and contingencies our business and operations are subject to a number of significant risks  the most of which are summarized in item a risk factors and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect results of operations and financial position 
risks from interest rate fluctuations and changes in foreign currency exchange rates are managed through normal operating and financing activities 
as of the years ended and  we had million and million  respectively  of interest rate swaps 
our hedges of interest rate risk were designated and documented at inception as cash flow hedges and are evaluated for effectiveness at least quarterly 
historically  we have not utilized derivatives for speculative purposes  however  as a result of the refinancing and the issuance of the credit facilities  all of our remaining interest rate swaps have been de designated from hedge accounting 
as of the year ended  we have million of de designated interest rate swap agreements that have not yet been terminated  although we may elect to early terminate these specific interest rate swap agreements prior to their scheduled maturities  of which million of these interest rate swaps will mature in the first quarter of with the remaining million will mature in the second quarter of as of the year ended  we had variable rate debt outstanding of million  after considering our interest rate swaps 
in addition  our term loan b is subject to a libor floor of  as such  a change of to current libor rates would not have a significant impact to our interest expense 
our changes in foreign currency exchange rates are managed through normal operating and financing activities 
we have foreign operations  primarily in canada and india  and thus are exposed to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for the year ended  a uniform strengthening of the united states dollar relative to the local currency of our foreign operations would have resulted in a decrease in sales and operating income of approximately million and million  respectively 
the effects of foreign currency exchange rates on future results would also be impacted by changes in sales levels or local currency prices
