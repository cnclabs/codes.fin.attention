these forward looking statements reflect our view only as of the date of this report 
we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statements 
you should also carefully consider the factors set forth in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development of pharmaceutical products based on our proprietary drug delivery technology platforms 
our product pipeline currently consists of seven investigational drug candidates in clinical development  with one program the subject of a new drug application nda with the us food and drug administration fda  one program in phase iii  two programs in phase ii and three programs in phase i 
the more advanced programs are all in the field of pain management and we believe that each of these targets large market opportunities with product features that are differentiated from existing therapeutics 
we have other programs underway in fields outside of pain management  including several efforts underway which seek to improve the administration of biotechnology agents such as proteins and peptides 
a central aspect of our business strategy involves advancing multiple product candidates at one time  which is enabled by leveraging our resources with those of corporate collaborators 
thus  certain of our programs are currently licensed to corporate collaborators on terms which typically call for our collaborator to fund all or a substantial portion of future development costs and then pay us milestone payments based on specific development or commercial achievements plus a royalty on product sales 
at the same time  we have retained the rights to other programs  which are the basis of future collaborations and over time may provide a pathway for us to develop our own commercial  sales and marketing organization 
collaborative research and development revenues collaborative research and development revenues consist of three broad categories a the recognition of upfront license payments on a straight line basis over the period of our continuing involvement with the third party  b the reimbursement of qualified research expenses by third parties and c milestone payments in connection with our collaborative agreements 
during the last several years  we generated collaborative research and development revenues from collaborative agreements with pain therapeutics  nycomed  king  hospira  endo and others 
product revenues we have historically generated product revenue from the sale of three product lines alzet osmotic pumps for animal research use  
table of contents lactel biodegradable polymers which are used by our customers as raw materials in their pharmaceutical and medical products  and certain key excipients that are included in remoxy 
in the future  we expect to generate modest revenue related to an animal health product which was approved and launched by our licensee in because we consider our core business to be developing and commercializing pharmaceutical systems  we do not intend to significantly increase our investments in or efforts to sell or market any of our existing product lines 
however  we expect that we will continue to make efforts to increase our revenue related to collaborative research and development by entering into additional research and development agreements with third party collaborators to develop product candidates based on our drug delivery technologies 
reduction in force in march  we reduced the size of our california workforce by employees or approximately of our headcount 
the goal of this action was to better align our cost structure with anticipated revenues and operating expenses  while not compromising our key corporate objectives for the year 
we substantially completed this headcount reduction during the first quarter of  and incurred approximately  in severance costs for the impacted employees in operating results since our inception in  we have had a history of operating losses 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and our net losses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred to research and develop our product candidates and to a lesser extent  from selling  general and administrative costs associated with our operations and product sales 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase modestly in the near future as we expect to continue to expand our clinical trials  nonclinical studies and other research and development activities 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to remain comparable in the near future 
we do not anticipate meaningful revenues from our pharmaceutical systems  should they be approved  for at least the next twelve months 
therefore  we expect to incur continuing losses and negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  the recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  accrued liabilities  contract research liabilities  inventories and stock based compensation 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of products is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the product is shipped and title transfers to customers  provided no continuing obligation on our part exists  the price is fixed or determinable and the collectability of the amounts owed is reasonably assured 
we enter into license and collaboration agreements under which we may receive upfront license fees  research funding and contingent milestone payments and royalties 
the accounting standards contain a presumption that separate contracts entered into at or near the same time with the same entity or related parties were negotiated as 
table of contents a package and should be evaluated as a single agreement 
our deliverables under these arrangements typically consist of intellectual property rights and research and development services 
we evaluate whether there is stand alone value for the delivered elements and objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered element s to allocate revenue to each element in multiple element agreements 
when the delivered element does not have stand alone value or there is insufficient evidence of fair value for the undelivered element s  we recognize the consideration for the combined unit of accounting in the same manner as the revenue is recognized for the final deliverable  which is generally ratably over the longest period of involvement 
returns or credits related to the sale of products have not had a material impact on our revenues or net loss 
upfront payments received upon execution of collaborative agreements are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as collaborative research and development revenue based on a straight line basis over the period of our continuing involvement with the third party collaborator pursuant to the applicable agreement 
such period generally represents the longer of the expected research and development period or other continuing obligation period defined in the respective agreements between us and our third party collaborators 
research and development revenue related to services performed under the collaborative arrangements with our corporate collaborators is recognized as the related research and development services are performed and the collectability of the amounts owed is reasonably assured 
these research payments received under each respective agreement are not refundable and are generally based on reimbursement of qualified expenses  as defined in the agreements 
research and development expenses under the collaborative research and development agreements generally approximate or exceed the revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements 
deferred revenue may result when we do not expend the required level of effort during a specific period in comparison to funds received under the respective agreement 
pursuant to asc  collaborative arrangements  for joint control and funding development activities  we recognize revenue from the net reimbursement of the research and development expenses from our partners and record the net payment of research and development expenses to our partners as additional research and development expense 
milestone payments under collaborative arrangements are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the at risk milestone events  which represent the culmination of the earnings process related to that milestone 
milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research and development efforts or by events external to us  such as regulatory approval to market a product or the achievement of specified sales levels by a third party collaborator 
as such  the milestones are substantially at risk at the inception of the collaboration agreement  and the amounts of the payments assigned thereto are commensurate with the milestone achieved 
in addition  upon the achievement of a milestone event  we have no future performance obligations related to that milestone payment 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are primarily comprised of salaries  benefits  stock based compensation and other compensation cost associated with research and development personnel  overhead and facility costs  preclinical and non clinical development costs  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  contract services  and other outside costs 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development costs paid to third parties under sponsored research agreements are recognized as expense as the related services are performed  generally ratably over the period of service 
in addition  net reimbursements of research and development expenses by our partners incurred are recorded as collaborative research and development revenue 
net payments of research and development expenses to our partners are recorded as an addition to our research and development expenses in the period incurred 
goodwill we record intangible assets when we acquire other companies and intellectual property rights 
the cost of an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including intangible assets  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 

table of contents goodwill is periodically assessed for impairment 
we assess the impairment of goodwill at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  our market capitalization relative to net book value  new information affecting the commercial value of the asset  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
we would also reconcile our estimate of total enterprise value to our market capitalization 
as of december   the carrying value of goodwill was approximately million 
no impairment of goodwill has been recorded through december  however  there can be no assurance that at the time other periodic reviews are completed  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
accrued liabilities and contract research liabilities we incur significant costs associated with third party consultants and organizations for pre clinical studies  clinical trials  contract manufacturing  validation  testing  and other research and development related services 
we are required to estimate periodically the cost of services rendered but unbilled based on management s estimates of project status 
if these good faith estimates are inaccurate  actual expenses incurred could materially differ from our estimates 
inventories inventories include certain excipients that are sold to a customer and included in products awaiting regulatory approval 
these inventories are capitalized based on management s judgment of probable sale prior to their expiration date which in turn is based on non binding forecasts from our customer 
the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate the value of inventory that may become expired prior to use 
we may be required to expense previously capitalized inventory costs upon a change in our judgment  due to  among other potential factors  a denial or delay of approval of our customer s product by the necessary regulatory bodies  or new information that suggests that the inventory will not be saleable 
in addition  these circumstances may cause us to record a liability related to minimum purchase agreements that we have in place for raw materials 
stock based compensation employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the employee stock award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite period in a manner similar to other forms of compensation paid to employees 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
we base the risk free rate that we use in the black scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in 
table of contents subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for options granted before january   we amortize the fair value on an accelerated basis 
for options granted on or after january   we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
asu provides application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated to one or more units of accounting 
this update establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence  if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific or third party evidence is available 
we have adopted this guidance prospectively beginning on january  under asu  we may be required to exercise considerable judgment in determining the estimated selling price of delivered items under new agreements and our revenue under new agreements may be more accelerated as compared to the prior accounting standard 
as such  the adoption of asu could have a material impact on our financial statements going forward 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and collaborative research and development and other revenue we recognize revenues from collaborative research and development activities and service contracts 
collaborative research and development revenue primarily represents net reimbursement of qualified expenses related to the collaborative agreements with various third parties to research  develop and commercialize potential products using our drug delivery technologies  revenue recognized from ratable recognition of upfront fees and milestone payments in connection with our collaborative agreements 
we expect our collaborative research and development revenue to fluctuate in future periods pending our efforts to enter into potential new collaborations and our existing third party collaborators commitment to and progress in the research and development programs 
the collaborative research and development and other revenues associated with our major collaborators are as follows in thousands year ended december  collaborator king pharmaceuticals  inc king hospira inc hospira nycomed danmark aps nycomed pain therapeutics  inc pain therapeutics endo pharmaceuticals  inc endo others total collaborative research and development and other revenue amounts related to ratable recognition of upfront fees were million in  million in and  in amounts related to ratable recognition of upfront fees were million in and zero in and 
table of contents amounts related to ratable recognition of upfront fees were million in  million in and million in amounts related to milestone revenue recognized in connection with the pain therapeutics collaboration were zero in both and and  in amounts related to ratable recognition of upfront fees were zero in   in and million in our agreement with endo terminated effective august  we recorded million of collaborative research and development and other revenue in compared to million in the increase in collaborative research and development revenue in compared to was primarily attributable to higher revenue recognized in connection with our agreements with hospira  king  pain therapeutics and nycomed  partially offset by no revenue from endo and lower revenue from feasibility projects 
we recorded million of collaborative research and development and other revenue in compared to million in the decrease in collaborative research and development revenue in was primarily attributable to lower revenue recognized in connection with our agreements with pain therapeutics  endo and nycomed  partially offset by higher collaborative research and development revenue recognized in connection with our agreements with king and various feasibility agreements compared to we received a million upfront fee in connection with the development and license agreement signed with hospira in june relating to posidur 
the million upfront fee is recognized as collaborative research and development revenue ratably over the term of our continuing involvement with hospira with respect to posidur 
we also received a million upfront fee in connection with the development and license agreement signed with alpharma acquired by king which was subsequently acquired by pfizer in september relating to eladur 
the million upfront fee is recognized as collaborative research and development revenue ratably over the term of our continuing involvement with alpharma with respect to eladur 
our estimate of the remaining term of our continuing involvement was modified in the second quarter of as a result of an updated development plan for eladur 
we also received a million upfront fee in connection with the development and license agreement signed with nycomed in november relating to posidur 
the million upfront fee is recognized as collaborative research and development revenue ratably over the term of our continuing involvement with nycomed with respect to posidur 
our estimate of the remaining term of our continuing involvement was modified in the first quarter and the fourth quarter of as a result of updated development plans for posidur in europe 
we also received a million upfront fee in connection with the license agreement signed with endo in march relating to transdur sufentanil 
the million upfront fee is recognized as collaborative research and development revenue ratably over the term of our continuing involvement with endo with respect to transdur sufentanil 
the term of the continuing involvement had been estimated based on the product development plan pursuant to the agreement 
our estimate of the remaining term of our continuing involvement was modified in the fourth quarter of as a result of endo s termination notice that we received in february the million upfront fee from endo was fully recognized as of march  product revenue a portion of our revenues is derived from our product sales  which include our alzet mini pump product line  our lactel biodegradable polymer product line and certain excipients that are included in remoxy 
net product revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively 

table of contents the decrease in product revenue in was primarily attributable to lower product revenue from the sale of certain excipients included in remoxy to king as discussed below  partially offset by higher product revenue from both the lactel and alzet product lines compared to product revenue in included million related to shipments to king that occurred in and the first quarter of but that had been deferred until a long term supply agreement was signed such that final terms and conditions of the sales were established 
this agreement was executed in the quarter ended september   and all of the deferred revenue was recognized as revenue in that period 
in  we experienced higher product revenue from our alzet product line as well as from the lactel product line primarily as a result of alzet s higher average realized prices and higher lactel unit sales compared with the increase in product revenue in compared with was primarily attributable to higher product revenue from the sale of certain excipients included in remoxy to king 
in addition  we experienced higher product revenue from our lactel product line as a result of higher units sold  partially offset by lower revenue from our alzet product line as a result of lower units sold in cost of revenues 
cost of revenues was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cost of revenues include the cost of product revenue from our alzet product line  our lactel product line and certain excipients that are included in remoxy 
the decrease in the cost of product revenue in was primarily the result of lower product revenue associated with certain excipients for remoxy  partially offset by higher units sold from our lactel product line compared to cost of product revenue and gross profit margin will fluctuate from period to period depending upon the product mix in a particular period 
the increase in the cost of product revenue in compared to was primarily the result of recognizing million of cost of certain excipients for remoxy sold to king  partially offset by lower units sold from our alzet product line and improved manufacturing efficiency from our lactel polymer product line 
cost of goods sold aggregating  in had been deferred until the execution of a final supply agreement with king in the third quarter of stock based compensation expense recognized related to cost of revenues was   and  in  and  respectively 
as of december   and  we had  and manufacturing employees  respectively 
we expect the number of employees involved in manufacturing will remain comparable in the near future 
research and development 
research and development expenses are primarily comprised of salaries  benefits  stock based compensation and other compensation cost associated with research and development personnel  overhead and facility costs  preclinical and non clinical development costs  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  contract services  and other outside costs 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and stock based compensation expense recognized related to research and development personnel was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
research and development expenses increased by million in compared to the increase in was primarily attributable to higher development costs associated with posidur  remoxy and other oradur based opioid products licensed to pain therapeutics and our biologics programs  partially offset by lower development costs associated with eladur  oradur adhd  transdur sufentanil and other research programs compared to as more fully discussed below 
research and development expenses decreased by million in compared to the decrease in was primarily attributable to lower development costs associated with eladur  remoxy and other select oradur based opioid drug candidates and our biologics programs  partially offset by higher development costs associated with posidur  our oradur adhd program and our other research programs compared to 
table of contents as more fully discussed below 
in addition  we paid million to epicept in the third quarter of under our amended agreement with epicept and recorded this amount as a research and development expense attributed to eladur in research and development expenses associated with our major development programs approximate the following in thousands year ended december  posidur remoxy and other oradur based opioid products eladur biologics programs oradur adhd transdur sufentanil others total research and development expenses see note strategic agreements in the financial statements for more details about our agreements with hospira  nycomed  king  pain therapeutics and endo 
posidur our research and development expenses for posidur increased to million in from million in  primarily due to higher costs associated with our phase iii clinical trial and higher employee costs for posidur compared to our research and development expenses for posidur increased to million in from million in  primarily due to higher costs associated with phase ii clinical trials conducted by nycomed and us in compared to remoxy and other oradur based opioid products our research and development expenses for remoxy and other oradur based opioids increased to million in from million in  primarily due to increased activities to support the resubmission of the remoxy nda in our research and development expenses for remoxy and other oradur based opioids decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to decreased support activities for remoxy after the filing of the remoxy nda which occurred in as well as decreased formulation and clinical manufacturing activities for other select oradur based opioid drug candidates in eladur our research and development expenses for eladur decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower employee costs and lower contract manufacturing expenses related to this product candidate 
our research and development expenses for eladur decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower employee costs  non clinical studies and contract manufacturing expenses related to this product candidate 
in addition  we paid million to epicept in related to certain intellectual property relevant to eladur under our amended agreement with epicept and recorded this amount as a r d expense in 
table of contents biologics programs our research and development expenses for biologics programs increased to million in from million in primarily due to higher external costs and employee related costs in support of these programs in our research and development expenses for biologics programs decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower external costs and employee related costs in support of these programs in oradur adhd our research and development expenses for oradur adhd decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower employee costs incurred for this program in our research and development expenses for oradur adhd increased to million in from million in  primarily due to increased formulation and other development activities for this program in transdur sufentanil our research and development expenses for transdur sufentanil decreased to  in from million in  primarily due to decreased external and employee costs for this drug candidate in our research and development expenses for transdur sufentanil were million in both and we incurred higher employee related cost for this product candidate in than in  essentially offset by decreased external costs 
other durect research programs our research and development expenses for all other activities decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower employee related costs and decreased formulation and development activities for these programs 
our research and development expenses for all other activities increased to million from million in  primarily due to higher employee related costs and increased formulation and development activities for these programs 
as of december   and  we had  and research and development employees respectively 
we expect research and development expenses to increase modestly in the near future as we continue product development efforts for our internal and partnered product candidates 
we cannot reasonably estimate the timing and costs of our research and development programs due to the risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical systems as outlined in the risk factors section of this report 
the duration of development of our research and development programs may span as many as ten years or more  and estimation of completion dates or costs to complete would be highly speculative and subjective due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products  including significant and changing government regulation  the uncertainties of future preclinical and clinical study results  the uncertainties with our collaborators commitment to and progress in the programs and the uncertainties associated with process development and manufacturing as well as sales and marketing 
in addition  with respect to our development programs subject to third party collaborations  the timing and expenditures to complete the programs are subject to the control of our collaborators 
therefore  we cannot reasonably estimate the timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the research and development programs 
for additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties  see risk factors above 

table of contents selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of salaries  benefits and stock based compensation associated with finance  legal  business development  sales and marketing and other administrative personnel  overhead and facility costs  and other general and administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense recognized related to selling  general and administrative personnel was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  in compared to  primarily due to lower stock based compensation expenses related to selling  general and administrative personnel  offset by higher patent and market research expenses incurred in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  in compared to  primarily due to lower employee  patent and consulting expenses incurred in compared to as of december   and  we had  and selling  general and administrative personnel  respectively 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to remain comparable in the near future 
write down of deferred royalties and commercial rights 
write down of deferred royalties and commercial rights was million in we had no similar charges in the other periods presented 
in  we recorded the fair value of common stock and a warrant that we issued to alza corporation in connection with an amended agreement related to chronogesic 
the amounts were recorded in stockholders equity as additional paid in capital and as a contra equity account referred to as deferred royalties and commercial rights 
at the end of  we made the strategic decision that other research and development programs would take priority over chronogesic and recorded a million non cash write down of deferred royalties and commercial rights given the fact that there are no plans in the foreseeable future to actively attempt to develop chronogesic 
other income expense 
interest and other income was   and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in interest and other income in as compared to was primarily due to the receipt of grants totaling  under the patient protection and affordable care act of for three qualifying therapeutic discovery projects in the fourth quarter of the decrease in interest and other income in was primarily the result of lower yields on our investments as well as lower average cash and investment balances compared to interest expense was   and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense in compared to was primarily due to a lower outstanding balance of equipment financing obligations in the decrease in interest expense in compared to was primarily due to the conversion of the remaining million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes in june income taxes 
as of december   we had net operating loss nol carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in the years through  and federal research and development tax credits of approximately million  which expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
as of december   we had nol carryforwards for state income tax purpose of approximately million  which expire in the years through  and state research and development tax credits of approximately million  which do not expire 
utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to federal and state ownership change limitations 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
as of december  and  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
deferred tax assets reflect the net tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards and the 
table of contents temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
because realization of such tax benefits is uncertain  we provided a valuation allowance as of december  and december  utilization of the nol and r d credits carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future provided by sections and of the internal revenue code of  as well as similar state and foreign provisions 
these ownership changes may limit the amount of nol and r d credits carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax  respectively 
in general  an ownership change  as defined by section  results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain shareholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
since our formation  we have raised capital through the issuance of capital stock on several occasions which  combined with the purchasing shareholders subsequent disposition of those shares  may have resulted in a change of control  as defined by section  or could result in a change of control in the future upon subsequent disposition 
in addition  we issued million of convertible notes in and subsequently all of these notes had been converted as of december  into our common stock 
we also issued approximately million shares of our common stock to venrock in connection with an equity financing in september these transactions may also have resulted in a change of control or could result in a change of control in the future upon the subsequent disposition of the shares 
we have not currently completed a study to assess whether a change in control has occurred or whether there have been multiple changes of control since our formation due to the significant complexity and cost associated with such a study and the fact that there could be additional changes in the future 
if we have experienced a change of control at any time since our formation  utilization of our nol or r d credits carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under sections and which is determined by first multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long term tax exempt rate  and then could be subject to additional adjustments  as required 
any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of our nol or r d credits carryforwards before utilization 
tax years to remain subject to future examination by the major tax jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash  cash equivalents  and investments totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
this includes  and  of interest bearing marketable securities classified as restricted investments on our balance sheet as of december  and  respectively  which primarily serve as collateral for letters of credit securing our leased facilities in california and alabama 
the letters of credit related to the security deposit of the leased facilities will expire in december and july we received million of cash in operating activities in the year ended december  and used million and million of cash in operating activities in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operations in was primarily attributable to the receipt of a million upfront payment from hospira in june the increase in cash used in operating activities in compared to was primarily due to a million upfront payment received from alpharma in we used million and million of cash from investing activities in the years ended december  and  respectively  but generated  of cash from investing activities in the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in investing activities in was primarily due to a decrease in net purchases of investments and in purchases of equipment compared with the increase in cash used in investing activities in was primarily due to higher net purchases of investments  partially offset by reduced purchases of property and equipment compared with we also anticipate incurring capital expenditures of 
table of contents approximately million over the next months 
the majority of these expenditures in relate to our outfitting a newly leased facility in alabama to support our lactel product line and polymer research activities 
the actual amount and timing of other capital expenditures will depend  among other things  on the success of clinical trials for our product candidates and our collaborative research and development activities 
we generated  million and million of cash from financing activities in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the lower amount of cash provided by financing activities in compared to was primarily due to approximately million of cash received from an equity financing in the increase in cash provided by financing activities in compared to was also due to the cash received from the equity financing in in november  we filed a new shelf registration statement on form s with the sec  which upon being declared effective in may  allowed us to offer up to million of securities from time to time in one or more public offerings of our common stock 
in september  we completed a privately negotiated transaction to sell  shares of our common stock to affiliates of venrock at a price of per share  raising total net proceeds of approximately million 
in july  we entered into an equity line of credit facility with azimuth opportunity ltd  or azimuth  under which we may sell to azimuth  subject to certain limitations  up to million of our common stock over a month period 
azimuth will not be obligated to purchase shares under the equity line of credit unless specified conditions are met 
if we are unable to meet the specified conditions with respect to any sale of shares under the azimuth equity line of credit  we may be unable to access this source of financing 
azimuth is also permitted to terminate the equity line of credit under certain circumstances 
cash used in our operating activities is heavily influenced by the timing and structure of new corporate collaborations 
while one feature of our business strategy is seeking new corporate collaborations  assuming no new collaborations and no milestone payments  we anticipate that cash used in operating activities will increase in the near future as we continue to research  develop  and manufacture our pharmaceutical systems 
in aggregate  we are required to make future payments pursuant to our existing contractual obligations as follows in thousands contractual obligations and thereafter total capital lease purchase commitments operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations includes principal and interest payments 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our planned operations  existing debt and contractual commitments and planned capital expenditures through at least the next months 
we may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated  resulting in the need for additional funding 
additionally  we do not expect to generate significant revenues from our pharmaceutical systems currently under development for at least the next twelve months  if at all 
depending on whether we enter into additional collaborative agreements in the near term and the extent to which we earn milestone revenues  we may be required to raise additional capital through a variety of sources  including the public equity markets  private equity financings  collaborative arrangements  and or public or private debt 

table of contents there can be no assurance that we will enter into additional collaborative agreements in the near term  will earn milestone revenues or additional capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our products  technologies or potential markets  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible given these two constraints 
we satisfy liquidity requirements by investing excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not utilized off balance sheet arrangements to fund our operations or otherwise manage our financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall and floating rate borrowings may lead to additional interest expense if interest rates increase 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our portfolio includes money markets funds  commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate notes  government securities and corporate bonds 
the diversity of our portfolio helps us to achieve our investment objectives 
as of december   approximately of our investment portfolio is composed of investments with original maturities of one year or less and approximately of our investment portfolio matures less than days from the date of purchase
