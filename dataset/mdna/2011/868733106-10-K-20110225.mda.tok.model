overview we are one of the leading providers of integrated communications services and are the bandwidth leader in the markets we serve 
we provide data  video and voice services to residential and business customers in the greater sacramento  california sacramento region and greater kansas city  kansas and missouri areas kansas city area 
we continue to expand the use of optical fiber in our networks 
we increasingly deploy our services by combining fiber to the home ftth and fiber to the node fttn facilities with the use of internet protocol ip based communications protocol 
our advanced telecommunications networks give us a competitive edge that enables us to provide our customers with higher data speeds for internet service and deploy multiple services at superior quality through our high bandwidth capacity 
our ip based communication protocol enables us to provide dedicated bandwidth at symmetrical data speeds to each of our customers in the sacramento region 
we classify our operations in two reportable segments broadband and telecommunications telecom 
broadband segment our broadband segment generates approximately of our consolidated operating revenues  primarily from subscriptions to our data  video and voice services broadband services 
we market our broadband services to residential and business customers  either individually or as part of a bundled package 
as of december   our broadband services served approximately  residential subscribers  of which subscribed to two or more of our broadband services  including that subscribed to all three of our broadband services triple play 
as of december   we had approximately  business customers 
during  new products and features including advanced digital tv adtv  faster data speeds  increased high definition hd channels  home networking and internet security software created enhanced subscriber value for our broadband services 
we continue to successfully offset industry wide declines of operating revenues in the telecom segment with our long term strategy to grow our broadband operations 
our data service can provide high speed internet access at symmetrical speeds of up to megabits per second mbps  depending on the nature of the network facilities that are available  the level of service selected and the geographic market availability 
our advanced telecommunications networks gives us the ability to offer our customers both faster and symmetrical data speeds  meaning internet speeds downstream are the same as those upstream  than our competitors 
customers can use the faster speeds 
table of contents for enhanced online gaming and faster uploading and downloading of multimedia such as music  photos and video content 
during  our data customers continued to demand higher data speeds 
as of december   approximately and of our data customers subscribed to speeds of mbps and mbps or greater  respectively 
in the sacramento region  approximately of our data customers subscribe to plans with speeds at or higher than mbps 
as of december   approximately of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to one of our high speed internet services 
our video services range from a limited basic service to our new product offering adtv  powered by microsoft mediaroom 
depending on the service selected and subject to geographic market availability  our video service subscribers have access to over channels  including premium and pay per view channels which include concerts  wrestling  boxing  sporting events and movies  video on demand vod service which allows access to a library of movies and the ability to start a selection at any time and to pause  rewind  fast forward and replay  premium vod channels  music channels and an interactive  on screen program guide which allows the subscriber to navigate the channel lineup  the vod library and recorded programs 
digital video subscribers may also subscribe to our advanced services  which consist of high definition television hdtv  and or digital video recorders dvr 
our adtv product  which is currently available in the sacramento region only  includes a whole home dvr  which allows customers the ability to watch recorded shows on any television in the house  record multiple shows at one time and utilize an intuitive on screen guide and user interface 
we anticipate the deployment of a whole home dvr in the kansas city area during as of december   approximately of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to one of our video services 
our voice over internet protocol voip digital phone product is available in the sacramento market  including those customers residing in the telecom segment service territory 
customers can select individual services or bundled packages that may include unlimited local calling or unlimited local and domestic long distance calling plans 
our voice products also include value added services such as voicemail  call waiting  caller identification and many other calling feature options 
as of december   approximately of the homes in our sacramento market have subscribed to our voip phone service 
we also offer traditional circuit switched voice services in some of the areas we serve 
the total voice penetration in the markets we serve was approximately as of december  we provide a variety of business communications services to small  medium and large business customers 
the services we offer to our business customers include fiber optics based high speed internet  customized data and ethernet transport services  data center and disaster recovery solutions  traditional landline and voip phone services  wireless backhaul and digital tv 
utilizing our existing fiber optic network  we have successfully secured contracts to serve over wireless carrier backhaul sites  primarily in the sacramento region 
we anticipate wireless backhaul revenue will continue to grow as wireless carriers  faced with escalating consumer and business demand for mobile broadband traffic  are forced to increase backhaul capacity 
telecom segment our telecom segment  which operates only in the sacramento region  offers a broad selection of telecommunications services including traditional circuit switched voice services  long distance services and a number of lightly regulated or non regulated services 
most long distance services are offered by our subsidiary surewest long distance  which is a reseller of long distance services 
the telecom segment provides a variety of business service offerings to small  medium and large business customers  including many services over our advanced fiber network 
the services we offer to our business customers include  but are not limited to high speed internet  customized data and ethernet transport services  data center and disaster recovery solutions  traditional landline and scalable ip communication systems 
during  business customers decreased to  as a result of the strained economic conditions 
we anticipate the telecom segment business customer count will stabilize and begin to trend favorably as the real estate market initiates a recovery and commercial vacancy rates decline 

table of contents the telecom segment also provides wholesale access services through the use of its network to the broadband segment  which enables the broadband segment to offer high speed internet  voip and video services to those customers within surewest telephone service area 
we anticipate the wholesale access services revenue stream will continue to increase as customers within the telecom segment service territory continue to demand broadband services 
telecom segment revenues have decreased as a percentage of our consolidated revenues from continuing operations over the past several years 
during  the telecom segment generated of our consolidated revenues from continuing operations  a decrease of from the decline in revenues is primarily the result of an industry wide trend of declining circuit switched voice revenue generating units rgus and a corresponding reduction in the use of related services 
many customers are choosing to subscribe to our broadband digital phone product instead of the traditional circuit switched phone service offered by surewest telephone 
in addition  the telecom segment revenues have been impacted by scheduled reductions in the subsidies we receive from governmental regulatory agencies 
however  the telecom segment remains an important part of our long term growth strategy as it continues to generate the majority of our income from continuing operations and free cash flow  which has been used in the current year to reduce long term debt and fund network enhancements 
current business developments in connection with our efforts to evaluate and potentially monetize excess assets  during we identified and began to actively market for sale certain of our real estate assets 
these regulated assets  which are included in the telecom segment  include acres of undeveloped land and an office building 
during the quarter ended december   we completed our plan to sell these assets and as a result they were classified as assets held for sale 
we expect the land will sell in the range of  to  in connection with the classification to assets held for sale  the carrying value of the office building was reduced to its estimated fair value  less selling costs  based on the current market conditions and listed selling price 
as a result  an impairment charge of  was recorded against accumulated depreciation during  in accordance with regulated telephone plant and equipment composite group remaining life methodology 
we evaluated the estimated fair value of the assets held for sale as of december  and determined there was not a significant change 
therefore  no additional impairment charge was recorded during the year ended december  as of december   these assets continue to be actively marketed for sale and classified as assets held for sale 
in february  we sold fifty two wireless communications towers tower assets owned by our subsidiary west coast pcs  llc west coast pcs to global tower partners 
west coast pcs was a component of our broadband segment 
the sale was completed for an aggregate cash purchase price of  resulting in a gain of  net of tax 
proceeds from the sale of the tower assets were used to repay a portion of outstanding long term debt 
in may  we completed the sale of the operating assets of our wireless business  surewest wireless  to verizon wireless verizon for an aggregate cash purchase price of  resulting in a gain of  net of tax 
as part of the agreement  verizon acquired the spectrum licenses and operating assets of surewest wireless  excluding our owned communication towers 
surewest wireless was previously reported as a separate reportable segment 
in february  we acquired of the issued and outstanding stock of surewest kansas  inc  formerly everest broadband  inc 
everest  surewest kansas or the kansas city operations for a total purchase price of  including transaction costs 
subsequent to the acquisition  the kansas city operations have been included in our broadband segment and consolidated results of operations 
surewest kansas is a competitive provider of high speed data  video and voice services in the kansas city area 
the addition of our kansas city operations accelerates our growth strategy and has positioned us as a premier provider of network services to residential and business customers in the markets we serve there  as well as in california

table of contents consolidated overview financial data in millions graphic for broadband and telecom results  see the financial data table above 
revenue and cost structure our broadband segment contributes the majority of our consolidated operating revenues as telecom revenues continue to decline as a result of a decline in traditional regulatory support mechanisms and continuing competitive challenges within the communications industry 
as we maintain our focus on growing the broadband segment  the telecom segment continues to comprise a smaller percentage of total revenues and adjusted ebitda 
however  the telecom segment remains an important part of our long term growth strategy as it continues to generate the majority of our income from continuing operations and free cash flow  which has been used in the current year to reduce long term debt and fund network enhancements 
our long term strategy remains to continue growing our broadband operations to counter the industry wide trend of declines in telecom revenues 
operating revenues operating revenues in the broadband segment increased  in compared to due to the continued growth in residential and business services

the policy recommendations include guiding principles to foster competition in broadband  telephone  wireless and cable services over the next decade  including recommendations related to universal service fund usf reform  intercarrier compensation  cable set top boxes and spectrum reallocation  among others 
the nbp recommendations most relevant to the company include shifting the current usf mechanisms that support universal voice telephone services to support of universal broadband deployment and the phased reduction of intercarrier access compensation levels to local reciprocal compensation levels  with a potential phase out of all such compensation within ten years 
some of these recommendations only restate pre existing fcc proposals in current rulemakings while others raise new issues 
the fcc has begun some proceedings to implement aspects of the national broadband plan 
in an april  decision  a federal appeals court found that the fcc lacked authority over certain internet related practices of comcast 
this decision came during a proceeding that had been initiated by the fcc to adopt rules related to the conduct of providers of retail internet services 
notwithstanding the federal appeals court decision  on december   the fcc adopted rules requiring that such providers honor certain operating principles  including principles of i transparency  ii no blocking  iii no unreasonable discrimination and iv reasonable network management in connection with their internet services 
the fcc order has already been appealed 
in addition  the fcc initiated action on february  to again consider reform of the current structure for intercarrier compensation and to consider rules for transitioning the current universal service fund to support broadband deployment 
the fcc actions in these and future proceedings could significantly alter the structure of these arrangements  and affect the costs and sources or revenue for affected service

action in any of these proceedings could have a material impact on us 
we will continue to monitor these matters  participate in them as we deem appropriate  and assess the potential impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
california public utility commission cpuc matters a cpuc decision in august allowed surewest telephone to continue receiving our  annual interim draw from the chcf 
the chcf was previously authorized by the cpuc to offset surewest telephone intrastate regulated operating expenses on an interim basis 
in august  we requested permission from the cpuc to implement a graduated phase down of our annual  interim draw 
in september  the cpuc issued decision which provides for surewest telephone to phase down its interim annual chcf draw over a five year period 
the phase down of the interim draw began in january  initially reducing the annual  interim draw to  and in each subsequent year will be incrementally reduced by  in our interim chcf draw was  we anticipate our interim chcf draw will be  in an ongoing proceeding relating to the new regulatory framework under which surewest telephone has been regulated since  the cpuc adopted decision in  which grants carriers broader pricing freedom in the provision of telecommunications services  bundling of services  promotions and customer contracts 
this decision adopted a new regulatory framework  the uniform regulatory framework urf  which among other things i eliminates price regulation and allows full pricing flexibility for all new and retail services except basic residential services  which limits increases to per year during and  ii allows new forms of bundles and promotional packages of telecommunication services  iii allocates all gains and losses from the sale of assets to shareholders and iv eliminates almost all elements of rate of return regulation  including the calculation of shareable earnings 
beginning january   the urf incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs are allowed full pricing flexibility for the basic residential rate 
on december   the cpuc issued a ruling to initiate a new phase to assess whether  or to what extent  the level of competition in the telecommunications industry is sufficient to control prices for the four largest ilecs in the state  including surewest telephone 
the cpuc actions in this and future proceedings could lead to new rules and an increase in government regulation 
in december  the cpuc issued a final decision in a proceeding investigating the continued need for an intrastate access element called the transport interconnection charge tic 
the final decision capped surewest telephone intrastate access charges through and the tic was eliminated effective january  surewest telephone will have an opportunity to recover all or part of our lost tic revenue elsewhere  including residential rate adjustments  as well as through growth of our broadband segment 
we anticipate a reduction in our intrastate access revenues of approximately  other regulatory matters we are also subject to a number of regulatory proceedings occurring at the federal and state levels that may have a material impact on our operations 
the fcc and state commissions have authority to issue rules and regulations related to our business 
a number of proceedings are pending or anticipated that are related to such telecommunications issues as competition  interconnection  access charges  intercarrier compensation  broadband deployment  consumer protection and universal service reform 
some proceedings may authorize new services to compete with our existing services 
proceedings that relate to our cable television operations include rulemakings on set top boxes  carriage of programming  industry consolidation and ways to promote additional competition 
there are various on going legal challenges to the scope or validity of fcc orders that have been issued 
as a result  it is not yet possible to determine fully the impact of the related fcc rules and regulations on our operations

our most significant use of funds in is expected to be for i budgeted capital expenditures of  to  ii scheduled payments of long term debt of  and iii anticipated interest payments of  as discussed above  throughout the year we may repurchase shares of the company common stock in the open market at the prevailing market price up to an amount authorized by the board of directors 
a portion of the budgeted capital expenditures is at our discretion and dependent upon our working capital position  operating cash flows and ability to borrow 
we can modify our planned construction and commitments if the results of operations or available capital so require 
a significant portion of our budgeted capital expenditures are success based and is partially dependent on our ability to manage our growth and expansion

the settlement period for unrecognized tax benefits and potential interest and penalties of cannot be reasonably determined  however  the liabilities are not expected to become due within the next twelve months 
we contribute to our frozen pension plan an actuarially determined amount as deemed necessary and in accordance with applicable federal income tax regulations 
a carryover balance of approximately  will reduce the required cash contribution for the pension plan year to approximately  see the defined benefit pension plan section below and note for more detailed discussion about the plan 
defined benefit pension plan as required  we contribute to our frozen pension plan  supplemental executive retirement plan and certain post retirement benefits other than pensions other benefits plan collectively the plans  which provide retirement benefits to certain eligible employees 
contributions are intended to provide for benefits attributed to service to date 
our funding policy is to contribute annually an actuarially determined amount consistent with applicable federal income tax regulations 
the cost to maintain our pension plan and future funding requirements are affected by several factors including the expected return on investment of the assets held by the pension plan  changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension expense and the amortization of unrecognized gains and losses 
returns generated on plan assets have historically funded a significant portion of the benefits paid under the pension plan 
we estimate the long term rate of return of plan assets will be 
however  the significant decline in the equity markets precipitated by the credit crisis in recent years has negatively affected the value of our pension plan assets 
the pension plan invests in marketable equity securities which are exposed to changes in the financial markets 
if the financial markets experience a downturn and returns fall below our estimate  as seen in recent years  we could be required to make a material contribution to the pension plan  which could adversely affect our cash flows from operations 

table of contents our minimum funding requirement for related to the pension plan is expected to be approximately  however  due to a carryover balance of approximately  and the timing of the quarterly installments  we are not required to make a cash contribution until january we will continue to evaluate the future funding requirements of the plans and fund them as necessary 
see note for a more detailed discussion regarding our pension plan and other benefits plan and the contractual obligations table above for information related to the funding requirement of our pension plan 
income taxes the timing of cash payments for income taxes  which is governed by the internal revenue service and other taxing jurisdictions  will differ from the timing of recording tax expense and deferred income taxes  which are reported in accordance with gaap 
for example  tax laws currently in effect for through regarding accelerated or bonus depreciation for tax reporting may result in less cash payments than the gaap tax expense 
acceleration of tax deductions could eventually result in situations where cash payments will exceed gaap tax expense 
changes in tax laws create uncertainty as to when or if this situation will occur within the next three years 
our deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and through the generation of future taxable income from ordinary and recurring operations 
deferred tax assets that are dependent on specific business segments generating future taxable income were determined to be more likely than not to be realized since those segments have at least years in which to generate the estimated required taxable income 
approximately  of future taxable income is estimated to be required to realize these deferred tax assets 
historically  pre tax earnings for financial reporting purposes have exceeded the amount of taxable income reported for income tax purposes 
this has primarily occurred due to the acceleration of depreciation deductions for income tax reporting purposes

critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies and estimates are discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management application of our accounting policies 
our judgments are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
however  because future events and the related effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results may differ from our estimates and assumptions and such differences could be material 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 

table of contents goodwill as discussed more fully in note  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc formerly statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate potential impairment 
we perform our annual fair value evaluation on november the impairment test for goodwill requires us to estimate the fair value at the reporting unit level 
our goodwill is allocated to the kansas city operations reporting unit and the telephone reporting unit 
the broadband segment includes the kansas city operations reporting unit 
the telecom segment includes the telephone reporting unit 
at december  the goodwill allocated to the kansas city operations reporting unit and the telephone reporting unit was  and  respectively 
kansas city operations reporting unit for the kansas city operations reporting unit  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow dcf model and market based approaches 
the assumptions used in estimating fair value are based upon a combination of historical results and trends  new industry developments  future cash flow projections  and relevant comparable company valuation multiples for the market based approach 
such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
the market based approach used in the valuation effort includes the guideline public companies method and the guideline transaction method 
the various valuation methods are weighted to reach a fair value conclusion for the kansas city operating reporting unit 
assumptions used in the dcf model include the following cash flow assumptions regarding investment in network facilities  distribution channels and customer base the assumptions underlying these inputs are based upon a combination of historical results and trends  new industry developments and the company business plans  weighted average cost of capital based on comparable public companies  and terminal growth rate 
at november  the fair value of the kansas city operations reporting unit was estimated at  and the associated carrying value was  when determining the fair value  the use of different estimates or assumptions within the dcf model could result in a different fair value 
as a sensitivity calculation  if the discount rate in our dcf model was increased to  the fair value would decrease from  to  which would not result in an impairment of goodwill recorded at the kansas city operations reporting unit  assuming there are no changes to the market based approaches used in the valuation 
assuming the discount rate in our dcf model was to increase  the terminal growth rate decreased by and the market based valuation approaches decreased in value by  the fair value of  would decrease by approximately  which may indicate an impairment as the carrying value would exceed the fair value by  in this scenario 
as discussed above  the other market based approaches are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
negative changes relating to the kansas city operations could result in potential impairment of goodwill recorded at the kansas city operations reporting unit 
changes in the overall weighting of the dcf model and the market based approach valuation models may also impact the resulting fair value and could result in potential impairment of goodwill recorded at the kansas city operations reporting unit 

table of contents telephone reporting unit for the telephone reporting unit  the estimated fair value is determined using a dcf model 
assumptions used in the dcf model for the telephone reporting unit include the following cash flow assumptions regarding investment in network facilities  distribution channels and customer base the assumptions underlying these inputs are based upon a combination of historical results and trends  new industry developments and the company business plans  weighted average cost of capital based on industry weighted average cost of capital  and negative terminal growth rate 
at november   the fair value of the telephone reporting unit was  and the associated carrying value was 
when determining the fair value  the use of different estimates or assumptions within the dcf model could result in a different fair value 
as a sensitivity calculation  if the discount rate were to increase and the terminal growth rate decreased by  the fair value would decrease by approximately  but would not result in an impairment of goodwill recorded at the telephone reporting unit 
revenue recognition as discussed more fully in note  total revenues from telephone services are affected by rates authorized by various regulatory agencies 
the fcc monitors surewest telephone interstate earnings through its tariff review procedures and the use of annual cost separation studies prepared by surewest telephone 
the fcc establishes rules that carriers must follow in the filing of tariffs and the preparation of the annual studies 
based on these rules  we are required to prospectively set our interstate rates based on the aforementioned cost separation studies 
these cost studies include estimates and assumptions regarding various financial data including operating expenses  taxes and investment in property  plant and equipment 
non financial data estimates are also utilized in the preparation of these cost studies  including projected demand usage and detailed network information 
we must also make estimates of the jurisdictional separation of this data to assign current financial and operating data to the interstate or intrastate jurisdiction 
these estimates are finalized in future periods as actual data becomes available to complete the separation studies 
we also participate in the neca common line pool for certain interstate services and derive revenues from that pool 
as a result of estimates and assumptions  it is reasonably possible that management estimates of surewest telephone interstate access revenues and shareable earnings obligations could change in the near term  and the amounts involved could be material 
allowances for doubtful accounts as discussed more fully in note  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
in evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable  we assess a number of factors including a specific customer or carrier ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical and future expectations of conditions that may impact our ability to collect our accounts receivable 
if circumstances change or economic conditions worsen such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant  our estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
if uncollectibility of our billed revenue changes by  we would expect an increase in uncollectible expense of approximately  as of december   we had three customers that accounted for approximately of our consolidated accounts receivable  net of allowances 
although management believes that these customers are creditworthy  a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material effect on their ability to pay timely and  therefore  to our results of operations  cash flows and financial 
table of contents condition 
in addition  certain revenues are subject to refund if the customer terminates services or returns equipment within a stipulated time period  or if certain performance criteria are not met 
accordingly  we maintain accounts receivable allowances and recognize certain customer refund liabilities  through charges to revenues  based on our best estimates of the resolution of these contingencies  which are based on historical experience 
income taxes as discussed more fully in notes and  we account for income taxes using the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
as we operate in more than one state  changes in our state apportionment factors  based on operational results  may affect our future effective tax rates and the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes asc formerly fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company financial statements 
under asc  we do not recognize any benefit in our financial statements for any uncertain income tax position if we believe the position in the aggregate has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
if we believe there is greater than likelihood that the position will be sustained  a benefit would be recognized in the financial statements equal to the largest amount that is believed more likely than not to be sustained upon an audit 
pension plan as discussed more fully in note  the cost to maintain our frozen pension plan and future funding requirements for the pension plan are affected by several factors including the expected return on investment of the pension plan assets  changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension expense and the amortization of unrecognized gains and losses 
changes in these estimates and other factors could significantly impact our benefit costs and obligations to maintain the pension plan 
returns generated on pension plan assets have historically funded a significant portion of the benefits paid under the pension plan 
we estimate the long term rate of return of pension plan assets will be 
the pension plan invests in marketable equity securities which are exposed to changes in the financial markets 
if the financial markets experience a downturn and returns fall below our estimate  as seen in recent years  we could be required to make a material contribution to the pension plan  which could adversely affect our cash flows from operations 
for the discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the pension plan was 
the discount rate was determined based on current yields on high quality corporate fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have the following effects on net periodic benefit cost percentage point increase percentage point decrease recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no

regulatory and legal matters significant portions of our telecommunication rates and charges are subject to regulation by the fcc and state commissions 
many of these rates and charges are based on various tariffs or service guides filed by surewest and others  including those filed by the neca for cl charges 
pending and future regulatory actions  with respect to these and other matters and the filing of new or amended tariffs  may have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in addition  the emergence of a range of products and services that operate partially or entirely outside traditional regulatory frameworks but that compete with regulated service offerings has created new challenges for both us and the regulators 
our consolidated financial condition and results of operations have been and will be affected by recent and future proceedings before the state commissions and fcc 
pending before the fcc and state commissions are proceedings that  among other things  are considering additional rules governing the opening of markets to competition and the regulation of the competing telecommunications providers  the nature and extent of the compensation  if any  to be paid by carriers and other providers to one another for network use  and the sums to be recovered through end users and other sources  the goals and definition of universal telephone service in a changing environment  including examination of subsidy support mechanisms for subscribers of different carriers including incumbent carriers and in various geographic areas  rules that will provide non discriminatory access by competing service providers to the network capabilities of local exchange carriers  and the regulated rates and earnings of surewest telephone

the outcomes and impact of these proceedings and related court matters on the telecom segment  the broadband segment and the company as a whole cannot be determined at this time 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and credit risk 
the disclosure is not meant to be a precise indicator of expected future losses  but rather an indicator of reasonably possible losses 
our exposure to market risk is primarily related to the impact of interest rate fluctuations of our debt obligations 
interest rate risks in our debt obligations we enter into debt obligations to fund acquisitions  operations and planned capital expenditures 
at december   we had long term debt outstanding of  of this amount   or  bears interest at fixed rates with a weighted average rate of 
additionally  we had  of outstanding borrowings on our credit facility bearing interest at london interbank offered rate libor based rates with a weighted average rate of 
based on borrowing rates currently available for loans with similar terms and maturities  the estimated fair value of all of our long term debt as of december  was  we currently have no outstanding short term debt obligations as of december  based on our variable rate debt outstanding at december   each basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would  respectively  increase or decrease our annual interest expense and related cash payments by approximately such potential increases or decreases are based on certain simplifying assumptions  including a constant level of variable rate debt and an immediate  across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period 
we continually monitor our interest rate risk exposures and may consider entering into interest rate swaps or interest rate cap contracts to manage the impact of the interest rate changes on earnings and operating cash flows
