item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements and our combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included as part of this annual report on form k 
operating results factors affecting operating results our results of operations are affected by key factors in each of our business segments as discussed below 
agribusiness in the agribusiness segment  we purchase  store  transport  process and sell agricultural commodities and commodity products 
profitability in this segment is affected by the availability and market prices of agricultural commodities and processed commodity products and the availability and costs of energy  transportation and logistics services 
profitability in our oilseed processing operations is also impacted by capacity utilization rates 
availability of agricultural commodities is affected by many factors  including weather  farmer planting decisions  plant disease  governmental policies and agricultural sector economic conditions 
demand for our purchased and processed agribusiness products is affected by many factors  including global and regional economic conditions  including changes in per capita incomes  the financial condition of customers  including customer access to credit  worldwide consumption of food products  particularly pork and poultry  changes in population growth rates  the relative prices of substitute agricultural products  outbreaks of disease associated with livestock and poultry  and  in the past few years  by demand for renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities and commodity products 
we expect that the factors described above will continue to affect global supply and demand for our agribusiness products 
we also expect that  from time to time  imbalances may exist between oilseed processing capacity and demand for oilseed products in certain regions  which impacts our decisions regarding whether  when and where to purchase  store  transport  process or sell these commodities  including whether to change the location of or adjust our own oilseed processing capacity 
sugar and bioenergy our sugar and bioenergy segment is an integrated business including the procurement and growing of sugarcane and the production of sugar  ethanol and electricity in our eight mills in brazil  five of which were acquired in february in the moema acquisition  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  our global sugar trading and merchandising activities and our minority interests in us corn based ethanol producers 

table of contents profitability in this segment is affected by the availability and quality of sugarcane  which impacts our capacity utilization rates  and by market prices of sugarcane  sugar and ethanol 
availability and quality of sugarcane is affected by many factors  including weather  geographical factors  such as soil quality and topography  and agricultural practices 
once planted  sugarcane may be harvested for several continuous years  but the usable crop decreases with each subsequent harvest 
as a result  the current optimum economic cycle is generally five or six consecutive harvests  depending on location 
we own and lease land on which we grow and harvest sugarcane and we also purchase sugarcane from third parties 
prices of sugarcane in brazil are established by consecana  the s o paulo state sugarcane and sugar and ethanol council  based on the sucrose content of the cane and the market prices of sugar and ethanol 
demand for our products is affected by many factors  including changes in global or regional economic conditions  the financial condition of customers  including customer access to credit  worldwide consumption of food products  changes in population growth rates  changes in per capita incomes  and demand for and governmental support of renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities  including sugarcane 
we expect that the factors described above will continue to affect supply and demand for our sugar and bioenergy products 
food and ingredients in the food and ingredients division  which consists of our edible oil products and milling products segments  our operating results are affected by changes in the prices of raw materials  such as crude vegetable oils and grains  the mix of products we sell  changes in eating habits  changes in per capita incomes  consumer purchasing power levels  availability of credit to commercial customers  governmental dietary guidelines and policies  changes in general economic conditions and competitive environment in our markets 
fertilizer in the fertilizer segment  demand for our products is affected by the profitability of the agricultural sectors we serve  the availability of credit to farmers  agricultural commodity prices  international fertilizer prices  the types of crops planted  the number of acres planted  the quality of the land under cultivation and weather related issues affecting the success of the harvest 
in addition  our profitability is impacted by international selling prices for imported fertilizers and fertilizer raw materials  such as phosphate  sulfur  ammonia and urea  and ocean freight rates and other import fees 
due to our significant operations in south america  our results in this segment are typically seasonal  with fertilizer sales normally concentrated in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to the timing of the agricultural cycle 
in addition to the above industry related factors which impact our business divisions  our results of operations are affected by the following factors foreign currency exchange rates due to the global nature of our operations  our operating results can be materially impacted by foreign currency exchange rates 
both translation of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements and foreign currency transactions can affect our results 
on a monthly basis  local currency based subsidiary statements of income and cash flows are translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes based on weighted average exchange rates during the monthly period 
as a result  fluctuations of local currencies compared to the us dollar during a monthly period impact our consolidated statements of income and cash flows for that period and also affect comparisons between periods 
subsidiary balance sheets are translated using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date with the resulting translation adjustments reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
included in accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ended december  and were foreign exchange net translation gains of million and  million  
table of contents respectively  and for the year ended december  were foreign exchange net translation losses of  million resulting from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities 
additionally  we record transaction gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity 
these amounts are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date  with the resulting gains or losses included in the entity statement of income and  therefore  in our consolidated statements of income as a foreign exchange gain loss 
we primarily use a combination of equity and intercompany loans to finance our subsidiaries 
intercompany loans that are of an investment nature with no intention of repayment in the foreseeable future are considered permanently invested and as such are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
as a result  any foreign exchange translation gains or losses on such permanently invested intercompany loans are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets 
in contrast  foreign exchange translation gains or losses on intercompany loans that are not of a permanent nature are recorded in our consolidated statements of income as a foreign exchange gain loss 
agribusiness segment brazil 
our agribusiness sales are us dollar denominated or us dollar linked 
in addition  commodity inventories in our agribusiness segment are stated at market value  which is generally linked to us dollar based international prices 
as a result  these commodity inventories provide a natural offset to our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates in our agribusiness segment 
appreciation of the real against the us dollar generally has a negative effect on our agribusiness segment results in brazil  as real denominated industrial costs  which are included in cost of goods sold  and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are translated to us dollars at stronger us dollar exchange rates  which results in higher us dollar costs 
in addition  appreciation of the real generates losses based on the changes in the real denominated value of our commodity inventories  which are reflected in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income 
however  appreciation of the real also generates offsetting net foreign exchange gains on certain derivative financial instruments and the net us dollar monetary liability position of our brazilian agribusiness subsidiaries  which are reflected in foreign exchange gains losses in our consolidated statements of income 
as a portion of working capital funding for our brazilian subsidiaries is denominated in us dollars  the mark to market losses on the commodity inventories during periods of real appreciation generally offset the foreign exchange gains on the us dollar denominated debt 
the converse is true for devaluations of the real and the related effect on our consolidated financial statements 
sugar and bioenergy segment brazil 
sales of ethanol and electricity  and certain sugar products produced by our mills are domestic and real denominated  as are our sugarcane growing and harvesting costs and industrial and selling  general and administrative expenses 
sugar produced in our brazilian mills is sold in both the export market and domestic market 
appreciation of the real against the us dollar generally has a negative effect on our sugar and bioenergy results in brazil as real denominated industrial costs  which are included in cost of goods sold  and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are translated to us dollars at stronger us dollar exchange rates  which results in higher us dollar costs 
these higher costs are largely offset by sales of domestic real denominated ethanol  energy and certain sugars produced in our mills 
edible oil and milling products segments brazil 
our food and ingredients businesses are generally local currency businesses 
the costs of raw materials  principally wheat and vegetable oils  are largely us dollar linked and changes in the costs of these raw materials have historically been passed through to the customer in the form of higher or lower selling prices 
however  delays or difficulties in passing through changes in raw materials costs into local currency selling prices can affect our margins 

table of contents fertilizer segment brazil 
our fertilizer segment sales prices are linked to us dollar based international fertilizer prices 
industrial and sg a expenses are real denominated costs 
inventories in our fertilizer segment are not marked to market but are accounted at the lower of cost or market 
these inventories have generally been financed with us dollar denominated debt  however  during we replaced a large portion of these liabilities with long term financing  including a combination of equity and long term intercompany loans  which are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
appreciation of the real against the us dollar generally results in higher industrial and sg a expenses when translated into us dollars and net foreign exchange gains on the net us dollar monetary liability position of our fertilizer segment subsidiaries 
gross profit margins are generally adversely affected if the real appreciates during the year as our local currency sales revenues are based on us dollar international fertilizer prices  whereas our cost of goods sold would reflect the higher real cost of inventories acquired and production costs incurred when the real was weaker 
inventories are generally acquired in the first half of the year  whereas sales of fertilizer products are generally concentrated in the second half of the year 
as a result  there is generally a lag between the recording of exchange gains on the net us dollar monetary liability position related to inventory purchases and the effects of the appreciating real on our gross profit margins 
the converse is true for devaluations of the real and the related effect on our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes as a bermuda exempted company  we are not subject to income taxes on income in our jurisdiction of incorporation 
however  our subsidiaries  which operate in multiple tax jurisdictions  are subject to income taxes at various statutory rates ranging from to 
determination of taxable income requires the interpretation of related and often complex tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction where we operate and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future events 
as a result of our significant business activities in south america  our effective tax rate is impacted by relative foreign exchange differences between the us dollar and the brazilian real 
at december  and  respectively  we recorded uncertain tax liabilities of million and million in other non current liabilities and million and million in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  of which million and million relates to accrued penalties and interest 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income 
during and  respectively  we recognized million and million in adjustments to accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in our consolidated statements of income 
results of operations overview net income attributable to bunge for was  million  an increase of  from in  resulting primarily from a  net gain on the sale in may of our brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets 
total segment ebit of  million represented an increase of  from the reported for and included  of pretax gain from the sale of our brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets 
also included in total segment ebit were million of expenses related to make whole payments in connection with the repayment of debt with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets 
the year was difficult for our fertilizer segment  where segment ebit declined significantly from a very strong to a loss in  primarily as a result of declines in both domestic and international prices of our key product raw materials and the sales prices of our products over almost all of which created negative margins for our business as the gradual decline in our inventory costs could not keep pace with the more rapidly declining selling prices 
agribusiness segment ebit increased with solid results comparable to oilseed processing margins were solid across all regions 
grain distribution activities benefited from strong 
table of contents chinese demand  particularly in the first half of  and the impact of a weather related crop shortage in eastern europe that increased our distribution volumes from north and south america 
volumes for the year were reduced slightly compared to due to the crop shortage in eastern europe  despite a good south american harvest compared to s short crop in that region 
impairment and restructuring charges of million were recorded in compared with million of impairment charges in in sugar and bioenergy  results were adversely affected by dry weather in brazil which reduced the volume and quality sucrose content of sugarcane available for milling  thus reducing the production of sugar and ethanol and lowering our capacity utilization which resulted in increased fixed cost absorption 
the drought also damaged our sugarcane plantations  resulting in increased depletion of these assets  which will require replanting 
in addition  increased costs associated with construction of our pedro afonso mill and the expansion of our santa juliana mill  as well as start up challenges as these mills became operational in the fourth quarter of reduced segment results 
results for included moema related acquisition expenses of approximately million and restructuring charges of approximately million related to the consolidation of our brazilian operations 
in the food and ingredients division  our edible oil products segment ebit decreased by million from million in to million in this reduction related primarily to the sale of our saipol joint venture in december  which contributed million to segment ebit  including a million gain from the sale of saipol 
impairment and restructuring charges of million  including primarily the write down of an oilseed processing and refining facility in europe  reduced results 
there were million of restructuring charges in volumes in the segment grew by largely due to our acquisition of raisio margarines in europe in late results improved in our milling products segment with a increase in segment ebit  primarily related to better operating conditions for our wheat mills in brazil compared to  when a very large brazilian wheat crop brought smaller  opportunistic competitors into the market for the crop season  pressuring wheat milling margins 
segment results in the first quarter of  bunge began reporting the results of its sugar and bioenergy businesss as a reportable segment 
prior to the first quarter of  sugar and bioenergy results and assets were included in the agribusiness segment 
accordingly  amounts for prior periods presented have been reclassified to conform to the current period segment presentation 
as a result  bunge has five reportable segments agribusiness  sugar and bioenergy  edible oil products  milling products and fertilizer  which are organized based upon similar economic characteristics and are similar in nature of products and services offered  the nature of production processes  the type and class of customer and distribution methods 
the agribusiness segment is characterized by both inputs and outputs being agricultural commodities and thus high volume and low margin 
the sugar and bioenergy segment involves sugarcane cultivation and milling to produce sugar  ethanol and electricity  trading and merchandising activities  and corn based ethanol investments and activities 
the edible oil products segment involves the manufacturing and marketing of products derived from vegetable oils 
the milling products segment involves the manufacturing and marketing of products derived primarily from wheat and corn 
following the completion of the sale of our brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets in may  the activities of the fertilizer segment include fertilizer blending and distribution in brazil as well as operations in argentina and the united states see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  we retained our interest in its fertilizer joint venture in morocco

table of contents year ended december  us in millions depreciation  depletion and amortization agribusiness sugar and bioenergy edible oil products milling products fertilizer total net income attributable to bunge total segment earnings before interest and tax ebit is an operating performance measure used by bunge management to evaluate its segments operating activities 
total segment ebit is a non gaap financial measure and is not intended to replace net income attributable to bunge  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
bunge management believes ebit is a useful measure of its segments operating profitability  since the measure allows for an evaluation of the performance of its segments without regard to its financing methods or capital structure 
in addition  ebit is a financial measure that is widely used by analysts and investors in bunge industries 
total segment ebit is not a measure of consolidated operating results under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to bunge or any other measure of consolidated operating results under us gaap 
a reconciliation of total segment ebit to net income attributable to bunge follows year ended december  us in millions total segment earnings before interest and tax interest income interest expense income tax noncontrolling interest share of interest and tax net income attributable to bunge compared to agribusiness segment 
agribusiness segment net sales increased due primarily to higher agricultural commodity prices when compared to volumes decreased by from due to lower grain origination and oilseed processing volumes in europe as a severe drought and export restrictions in eastern europe reduced volumes  which were partially offset by strong demand from china in the first half of and higher south american volumes compared to when south american crops were reduced due to adverse weather conditions 
cost of goods sold increased primarily due to higher agricultural commodity prices when compared to cost of goods sold in included million in impairment and restructuring charges primarily related to the write down of an oilseed processing and refining facility in europe and the closure of an older  less efficient north american oilseed processing facility 
included million of impairment and restructuring charges 
gross profit increased from as a result of strong margins in grain origination which more than offset lower oilseed processing margins across all of our geographies in gross profit in 
table of contents included million of impairment and restructuring charges 
risk management strategies performed well overall in a volatile market in sg a increased largely due to higher employee related costs and the unfavorable impact of the weaker average us dollar on foreign local currency costs when translated to us dollars 
restructuring charges of million were recorded in compared to million of impairment charges related to certain real estate assets and an equity investment in a north american biodiesel company in foreign exchange losses were million in compared to gains of million in  which reflected the impact of the significant brazilian real appreciation on our net us dollar monetary liability position in brazil in equity in earnings of affiliates increased in due primarily to improved results in our south american oilseed processing joint ventures 
noncontrolling interest was million in and million in and represents the noncontrolling interest share of period income at our non wholly owned subsidiaries  primarily our oilseed processing operations in china 
other income expense for was income of million compared to a net expense of million in agribusiness segment ebit increased primarily as a result of the factors discussed above 
sugar and bioenergy segment 
sugar and bioenergy segment net sales increased when compared to due to the expansion of our sugar and ethanol production activities in brazil  driven by our acquisition of the moema mills 
the increased net sales also reflect increased sugar and ethanol prices in volumes increased  mainly from this expansion of our sugar industrial business 
cost of goods sold increased due to a number of factors  including the moema acquisition and increased prices of sugarcane 
in addition  cost of goods sold includes the impact of the severe drought which reduced the availability and quality of sugarcane for production 
the impact of operating our facilities below capacity  including losses from settlement of certain forward contracts for which we did not have sufficient sugar production to meet related delivery obligations and higher fixed cost absorption  increased cost of goods sold 
further  the drought impact includes a charge for the loss of portions of our growing sugarcane 
increased costs and start up challenges related to construction and expansion at certain of our mills also contributed to the increase 
the unfavorable impact of a weaker us dollar on the translation of local currency costs to us dollars also contributed to the increase 
gross profit increased to million in from million in primarily as a result of the increased volumes from acquisition of the moema mills and improved margins in our sugar trading and merchandising business  largely offset by the impact of a drought in our primary sugarcane growing areas in brazil and increased costs incurred in connection with construction and expansion projects at two mills that were completed in the fourth quarter of sg a expenses increased to million in from million in primarily due to the addition of the moema mills and the related expansion of our industrial operations 
sg a was also unfavorably impacted by the impact of a weaker us dollar on the translation of local currency costs into us dollars 
in addition  includes transaction costs of million related to the moema acquisition and restructuring charges of million related to consolidation of our brazilian operations 
foreign exchange gains increased by million to million in compared to million in driven primarily by the volatility of the brazilian real us dollar exchange during on our expanded industrial operations in brazil 

table of contents equity in earnings of affiliates was a loss of million in compared to a loss of million in representing the results of our north american bioenergy investments 
noncontrolling interest was million in and million in and represents the noncontrolling interest share of period losses at our non wholly owned brazilian sugar cane mills 
segment ebit decreased by million to a loss of million from income of million in largely due to the impact of operating our facilities significantly below capacity  the related settlement losses on forward contracts  and the destruction of a portion of our growing sugarcane due to the severe drought conditions in brazil 
these impacts reduced gross profit to a level that was below our total selling  general and administrative expenses  contributing to the ebit loss 
edible oil products segment 
edible oil products segment net sales increased primarily due to higher average selling prices 
volumes increased primarily driven by higher volumes in north america and europe 
cost of goods sold increased as a result of higher raw material prices  higher volumes and the unfavorable impact of the weaker us dollar on the translation of local currency costs in brazil into us dollars 
cost of goods sold also included impairment charges of million in primarily related to the write down of a european oilseed processing and refining facility 
impairment and restructuring charges were million in gross profit increased  primarily as a result of improved margins resulting from a better alignment of selling prices and cost of goods sold in europe and an improved product mix in north america in  which were partially offset by the million of impairment and restructuring charges 
sg a increased primarily due to the impact of a weaker average us dollar on foreign local currency costs in brazil translated into us dollars and restructuring charges of million 
foreign exchange results for were negligible compared with losses of million in equity in earnings of affiliates was negligible for compared to million in  which included a million gain related to bunge sale of its interest in saipol  a european edible oil joint venture in the fourth quarter of in addition  our share of saipol earnings for was million 
noncontrolling interest decreased due to weaker results in non wholly owned subsidiaries  mainly in poland 
other income expense was a net expense of million in compared to net expense of million in segment ebit decreased by million to million from million in ebit for included impairment and restructuring charges of million 
ebit for included million from our share of earnings in saipol and the gain on the sale of our saipol investment 
milling products segment 
milling products segment net sales increased from primarily due to higher volumes and higher average selling prices in wheat milling as global wheat prices increased due to drought related crop shortages in eastern europe 
cost of goods sold increased when compared to primarily due to higher volumes and impairment and restructuring charges of million related primarily to the write down of a long term supply agreement that accompanied a wheat mill acquisition 
gross profit increased primarily as a result of better operating conditions for our wheat mills in brazil compared to  when a very large brazilian wheat crop brought smaller  opportunistic competitors into the market for the crop season  pressuring wheat milling margins 
the higher gross profit in wheat milling are partially offset by lower volumes and margins in corn milling 

table of contents sg a expenses increased primarily due to restructuring charges of million and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation of the brazilian real into us dollars 
other income of million in was primarily related to a gain on the sale of a wheat milling facility in brazil 
segment ebit increased to million in from million in as a result of the factors described above 
fertilizer segment 
fertilizer segment net sales declined during when compared to primarily due to the sale of our brazilian nutrients assets  including our interest in fosfertil  in the second quarter of volumes declined compared to due primarily to the sale of our brazilian nutrients assets as well as lost sales opportunities and other disruptions as we continued to adjust our footprint and business model following the sale of these assets 
cost of goods sold decreased primarily as a result of lower volumes and raw material costs compared to  also included restructuring charges of million 
gross profit increased to million in from a loss of million in as a result of improved margins resulting from lower raw material and finished product inventory costs and lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses as a result of the sale of the brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets 
gross profit also increased as a result of our argentine fertilizer acquisition in january  sg a declined slightly to million in from million in primarily as a result of the elimination of certain costs associated with the brazilian nutrients assets  which was partially offset by expenses at our argentine operations and the unfavorable impact of a weaker us dollar on functional currency expenses when translated into us dollars 
included a transactional tax credit of million due to a law change in brazil 
gain on sale of fertilizer nutrients assets was  million in the disposal of our brazilian nutrients assets  including our investments in fosfertil and fosbrasil  a phosphoric acid joint venture  was completed during the second quarter of the reported gain is net of approximately million of transaction related costs 
foreign exchange losses of million in decreased from a gain of million in  primarily driven by lower us dollar monetary liability positions funding working capital during when compared to equity in earnings of affiliates increased by million to million from due to improved results in our moroccan phosphate joint venture which began operations in noncontrolling interest was million in  which was the noncontrolling interest share of period income at fosfertil 
in  noncontrolling interest was million  which was the noncontrolling interest share of period losses at fosfertil 
our investment in fosfertil was included in the brazilian nutrients assets sale in the second quarter of and accordingly  fosfertil was deconsolidated from our financial statements as of the sale date 
segment ebit increased to  million as a result of the gain on the sale of the brazilian nutrients assets and improved gross profit when compared to losses of million in when results were impacted by high inventory costs in a declining price environment 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
in  we recorded an expense of million  primarily related to make whole payments made in connection with the early repayment of approximately million of debt with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets 

table of contents interest 
a summary of consolidated interest income and expense for the periods indicated follows year ended december  us in millions interest income interest expense interest income decreased primarily due to lower rates on interest bearing cash balances 
interest expense increased due primarily to debt acquired as part of the moema acquisition at higher average borrowing rates and higher average working capital requirements during when compared to these increases were partially offset by reduced average borrowings in the latter part of resulting from the early extinguishment of debt noted above 
interest expense includes facility commitment fees  amortization of deferred financing costs and charges on certain lending transactions  including certain intercompany loans and foreign currency conversions in brazil 
income tax expense 
in  we recorded an income tax expense of million compared to an income tax benefit of million in the effective tax rate for was compared to a benefit of for the higher effective tax rate for resulted primarily from the gain on the brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets sale in the second quarter of the benefit for resulted primarily from a combination of losses in our brazilian fertilizer operations altering the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions and tax benefits of approximately million primarily related to the reversal of a valuation allowance at a european subsidiary and the receipt of a favorable ruling in brazil regarding an uncertain tax position 
included in our income tax expense for was the million of tax reported on the gain of the brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets sale that occurred in the second quarter of and million for valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets which we currently do not expect to fully recover prior to their expiration 
tax expense also included million of tax expense related to the new thin capitalization tax legislation that was enacted in brazil in september  which denies income tax deductions for interest payments with respect to certain debt to the extent a company debt to equity ratio exceeds a certain threshold or the debt is with related parties located in a tax haven jurisdiction as defined under the law 
net income attributable to bunge 
net income attributable to bunge increased by  million to net income of  million from million in net income attributable to bunge for included the result of the gain on the sale of the brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets of  million and net impairment and restructuring charges of million

compared to agribusiness segment 
agribusiness segment net sales decreased due primarily to lower agricultural commodity prices when compared to the historically high prices experienced during much of volumes decreased by from primarily due to lower overall grain and oilseed distribution volumes as a result of the reduced soybean crops in south america 
partially offsetting this decrease was strong demand for soybeans from china  as well as higher oilseed processing volumes in eastern europe and asia  reflecting our investments to expand in these high growth areas 
cost of goods sold decreased primarily due to lower agricultural commodity prices when compared to the historically high prices experienced during much of cost of goods sold in

gross profit in included million of mark to market valuation adjustments related to counterparty risk on commodity and other derivative contracts  which were partially offset by transactional tax credits of million as a result of a favorable tax ruling in brazil 
sg a decreased largely due to lower employee variable compensation related costs  focused cost reduction efforts and the beneficial impact of the stronger us dollar on foreign local currency costs when translated to us dollars 
these cost reductions were partially offset by million of impairment charges related to certain real estate assets and an equity investment in a north american biodiesel company 
in  sg a expenses were reduced by million of transactional tax credits in brazil resulting from a favorable tax ruling 
foreign exchange gains of million reflected mainly the impact of the brazilian real appreciation on the net us dollar monetary liability position in brazil compared to million of losses in resulting from depreciation of the brazilian real 
foreign exchange gains and losses in our agribusiness segment were substantially offset by the currency impact on inventory mark to market valuations  which were included in cost of goods sold 
equity in earnings of affiliates increased in due primarily to higher results in solae  our north american soy ingredients joint venture 
noncontrolling interest increased due to improved results in non wholly owned subsidiaries  largely in our oilseed processing operations in china  which was partially offset by weaker results in poland

ebit for also benefited from the impact of a stronger us dollar which reduced translated local currency costs and expenses 
milling products segment 
milling products segment net sales decreased primarily due to lower average selling prices when compared to the historically high wheat and corn raw material prices experienced in the impact of a weaker average real exchange rate also reduced wheat milling net sales when translated into us dollars 
these decreases more than offset a volume increase of in when compared to  due largely to the acquisition of a us mill in the fourth quarter of the corn milling volume increase was partially offset by lower volumes in wheat milling as a result of a larger than expected brazilian wheat crop which resulted in low wheat prices that brought smaller  opportunistic competitors into the wheat milling industry in cost of goods sold decreased due primarily to lower raw material costs as a result of lower raw material prices and the beneficial impact of foreign exchange translation of the brazilian real into us dollars

financing arrangements and outstanding indebtedness 
we conduct most of our financing activities through a centralized financing structure that enables us and our subsidiaries to borrow more efficiently 
this structure includes a master trust facility  the primary assets of which consist of intercompany loans made to bunge limited and its subsidiaries 
certain of bunge limited owned finance subsidiaries  bunge limited finance corp  bunge finance europe bv and bunge asset funding corp  fund the master trust with long and short term debt obtained from third parties  including through our commercial paper program and certain credit facilities  as well as the issuance of senior notes 
borrowings by these finance subsidiaries carry full  unconditional guarantees by bunge limited 
revolving credit facilities

the following table summarizes these facilities as of the periods presented total availability borrowings outstanding commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities maturities december  december  december  us in millions commercial paper long term revolving credit facilities total our commercial paper program is supported by committed back up bank credit lines the liquidity facility equal to the amount of the commercial paper program provided by lending institutions that are rated at least a by standard poor and p by moody investor services 
the liquidity facility  which matures in june  permits bunge  at its option  to set up direct borrowings or issue commercial paper in an aggregate amount of up to million 
the cost of borrowing under the liquidity facility would typically be higher than the cost of borrowing under our commercial paper program 
at december   no borrowings were outstanding under the commercial paper program 
in addition to the committed facilities above  from time to time  we enter into uncommitted short term credit lines as necessary based on our liquidity requirements 
at december    million was outstanding under these uncommitted short term credit lines 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under these uncommitted short term credit lines 
short and long term debt 
our short and long term debt increased by billion at december  from december   primarily due to increased working capital resulting from higher commodity prices and million of debt assumed in the moema acquisition  partially offset by debt repayments made with the proceeds received from the sale of our brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets

our million three year and million month syndicated revolving credit facilities are scheduled to mature in april we intend to replace these facilities prior to their maturity dates with a single credit facility in the first quarter of in addition  we have million of term loans and a billion japanese yen term loan maturing in august and october  respectively 
we intend to replace these facilities with term debt prior to their maturity 
depending on prevailing conditions in the credit markets  we may face increased borrowing costs as well as higher bank fees in connection with these financings 
we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt in open markets  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors

our debt agreements do not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate maturity of our debt 
however  credit rating downgrades would increase our borrowing costs under our credit facilities and  depending on their severity  could impede our ability to obtain credit facilities or access the capital markets in agreements as a result of such downgrades 
a significant increase in our borrowing costs could impair our ability to compete effectively in our business relative to competitors with higher credit ratings 
our credit facilities and certain senior notes require us to comply with specified financial covenants  including minimum net worth  minimum current ratio  a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and limitations on secured debt 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  interest rate swap agreements 
we use interest rate swaps as hedging instruments and record the swaps at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded contemporaneously in earnings 
additionally  the carrying amount of the associated debt is adjusted through earnings for changes in the fair value due to changes in benchmark interest rates 
ineffectiveness  as defined in the accounting standards codification  is recognized to the extent that these two adjustments do not offset

on june   the company announced a common share repurchase program and repurchased approximately million of shares 
the treasury shares were fully utilized to satisfy the conversion of bunge cumulative mandatory convertible preference shares to common shares on december  noncontrolling interest decreased to million at december  from million at december   due primarily to the deconsolidation of fosfertil and derecognition of million of noncontrolling interests resulting from the sale of our brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets

brazilian farmer credit background 
we advance funds to farmers  primarily in brazil  through secured advances to suppliers and prepaid commodity purchase contracts 
we also sell fertilizer to farmers  primarily in brazil  on credit as described below 
all of these activities are generally intended to be short term in nature 
the ability of our customers and suppliers to repay these amounts is affected by agricultural economic conditions in the relevant geography  which are  in turn  affected by commodity prices  currency exchange rates  crop input costs and crop quality and yields 
as a result  these arrangements are typically secured by the farmer crop and  in many cases  the farmer land and other assets 
on occasion  brazilian farm economics in certain regions and certain years  particularly and have been adversely affected by factors including volatility in soybean prices  a steadily appreciating brazilian real and poor crop quality and yields 
as a result  certain farmers have defaulted on amounts owed 
while brazilian farm economics have improved over the past few years  some brazilian farmers continue to face economic challenges due to high debt levels and a strong brazilian real 
upon farmer default  we generally initiate legal proceedings to recover the defaulted amounts 
however  the legal recovery process through the judicial system is a long term process  generally spanning a number of years 
as a result  once accounts have been submitted to the judicial process for recovery  we may also seek to renegotiate certain terms with the defaulting farmer in order to accelerate recovery of amounts owed 
in addition  we have tightened our credit policies to reduce exposure to higher risk accounts  and have increased collateral requirements for certain customers 
because brazilian farmer credit exposures are denominated in local currency  reported values are impacted by movements in the value of the brazilian real when translated into us dollars 
from december  to december   the brazilian real appreciated by  increasing the reported farmer credit exposure balances when translated into us dollars 
brazilian fertilizer trade accounts receivable 
in our brazilian fertilizer operations  customer accounts receivable are intended to be short term in nature  and are expected to be repaid either in cash or through delivery to bunge of agricultural commodities when the related crop is harvested 
as the farmer cash flow is seasonal and is typically generated after the crop is harvested  the actual due dates of the accounts receivable are individually determined based upon when a farmer purchases our fertilizer and the anticipated date for the harvest and sale of the farmer crop 
these receivables are typically secured by the farmer crop 
we initiate legal proceedings against customers to collect 
table of contents amounts owed which are in default 
in some cases  we have renegotiated amounts that were in legal proceedings to secure the subsequent year crop 
we periodically evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable and record allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful 
we base our determination of the allowance on analyses of credit quality of individual accounts  considering also the economic and financial condition of the farming industry and other market conditions and the fair value of any collateral related to amounts owed 
we continuously review defaulted farmer receivables for impairment on an individual account basis 
bunge considers all accounts in legal collection processes to be defaulted and past due 
for such accounts  bunge determines the allowance for uncollectible amounts based on the fair value of the associated collateral  net of estimated costs to sell 
for all renegotiated accounts current and past due  bunge considers changes in farm economic conditions and other market conditions  its historical experince related to renegotiated accounts and the fair value of collateral in determining the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
in addition to our fertilizer trade accounts receivable  we issue guarantees to third parties in brazil relating to amounts owed these third parties by certain of our customers 
these guarantees are discussed under the heading guarantees

secured advances to suppliers and prepaid commodity contracts 
we purchase soybeans through prepaid commodity purchase contracts advance cash payments to suppliers against contractual obligations to deliver specified quantities of soybeans in the future and secured advances to suppliers advances to suppliers against commitments to deliver soybeans in the future  primarily in brazil 
these financing arrangements are typically secured by the farmer future crop and mortgages on the farmer land  buildings and equipment  and are generally settled after the farmer crop is harvested and sold 
interest earned on secured advances to suppliers of million  million and million for  and  respectively  is included in net sales in the consolidated statements of income

we intend to make capital expenditures of approximately  million in of this amount  we expect that approximately will be used for sustaining current production capacity  as well as for safety and environmental programs 
the balance primarily relates to investments to continue to expand our sugarcane milling capacity in brazil  construct our soy processing facilities in vietnam  china and paraguay and our export grain terminal in the us pacific northwest  and expansion of our grain elevator network in the us we intend to fund this level of capital expenditures with cash flows from operations and available borrowings 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements guarantees we have issued or were party to the following guarantees at december  us in millions maximum potential future payments customer financing unconsolidated affiliates financing total we have issued guarantees to third parties in brazil related to amounts owed these third parties by certain of our customers 
the terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financing arrangements  which are generally one year or less  with the exception of guarantees issued under certain brazilian government programs  primarily from and  where terms are up to five years 
in the event that the customers default on their payments to the third parties and we would be required to perform under the guarantees  we have obtained collateral from the customers 
at december   we had approximately million of tangible property that had been pledged to us as collateral against certain of these financing arrangements 
we evaluate the likelihood of customer repayments of amounts due under these guarantees based upon an expected loss analysis and record the fair value of such guarantees as an obligation in our consolidated financial statements 
our recorded obligation related to these guarantees was million at december  we issued guarantees to certain financial institutions related to debt of certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures 
the terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financings which have maturity dates in and there are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable us to recover any amounts paid under these guarantees 
at december   our recorded obligation related to these guarantees was million 
in addition  bunge limited has provided full and unconditional parent level guarantees of the indebtedness outstanding under certain senior credit facilities and senior notes entered into  or issued by  its owned subsidiaries 
at december   our consolidated balance sheet includes debt with a carrying amount of  million related to these guarantees 
this debt includes the senior notes issued by two of our owned finance subsidiaries  bunge limited finance corp 
and bunge na finance na there are no significant restrictions on the ability of bunge limited finance corp  bunge na finance na or any other subsidiary of ours to transfer funds to bunge limited 
accounts receivable securitization facilities in january  we adopted a fasb issued standard that resulted in amounts outstanding under our securitization programs being accounted for as secured borrowings and reflected as short term debt on our consolidated balance sheets 
as a result of this change in accounting standards  we significantly reduced our utilization of these programs and either terminated or allowed these programs to expire 
certain of our european subsidiaries had an accounts receivable securitization facility  through which subsidiaries sold without recourse certain eligible trade accounts receivable up to a maximum amount of million euro 
utilization of these facilities stopped in march and the facility was allowed to expire in october the effective yield rates on accounts receivable sold were based on monthly eur libor plus per annum  which included the program cost and certain administrative fees 
in the years ended december   and  we recognized expenses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income related to this facility 
at december   we had sold approximately million of accounts receivable to the facility  of which we had retained million of beneficial interests in certain accounts receivable that did not qualify as sales 
the 
table of contents beneficial interests were subordinate to investors interests and were valued at historical cost  which approximated fair value 
the beneficial interests were recorded in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million against the beneficial interests at december  there were no amounts outstanding under the facility at december  we had two revolving accounts receivable securitization facilities through our north american operating subsidiaries  through which we sold  on a revolving basis  undivided percentage ownership interests undivided interests in designated accounts receivable pools without recourse up to a maximum of approximately million as of december  during  we did not utilize these facilities and we terminated the million facility in march and allowed the million facility to expire in july the effective rate on these facilities approximated the day commercial paper rate plus annual commitment fees ranging from basis points on an undrawn basis to basis points on a drawn basis 
during  outstanding undivided interests averaged million 
there were no outstanding undivided interests in pooled accounts receivable at december  or we recognized expenses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual obligations and their expected maturities at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in the future periods indicated at december  contractual obligations total less than year years years after years us in millions other short term borrowings variable interest rate obligations long term debt fixed interest rate obligations non cancelable lease obligations freight supply agreements inventory purchase commitments uncertain income tax positions total contractual obligations we also have variable interest rate obligations on certain of our outstanding borrowings 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into purchase commitments for time on ocean freight vessels and freight service on railroad lines for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities 
in addition  we sell time on these ocean freight vessels when excess freight capacity is available 
these agreements range from two months to approximately five years in the case of ocean freight vessels and to years in the case of railroad services 
actual amounts paid under these contracts may differ due to the variable components of these agreements and the amount of income earned by us on the sale of excess capacity 
the railroad freight services agreements require a minimum monthly payment regardless of the actual level of freight services used by us 
the costs of our freight supply agreements are typically passed through to our customers as a component of the prices we charge for our products 
however  changes in the market value of 
table of contents freight compared to the rates at which we have contracted for freight may affect margins on the sales of agricultural commodities 
represents estimated payments of liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
also in the ordinary course of business  we enter into relet agreements related to ocean freight vessels that we have leased from third parties 
these relet agreements are similar to sub leases 
payments to be received by us under such relet agreements are anticipated to be approximately million in at december   we had million of contractual commitments related to construction in progress 
in addition  we have land lease agreements for the production of sugarcane 
these agreements have an average life of six to seven years and cover approximately  hectares of land 
amounts owed under these agreements are dependent on several variables including the quantity of sugarcane produced per hectare  the total recoverable sugar trs per ton of sugarcane produced and the price for each kilogram of trs as determined by consecena  the s o paulo state sugarcane and sugar and ethanol council 
the related expense included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income for was million 
employee benefit plans we expect to contribute million to our defined benefit pension plans and million to our post retirement healthcare benefit plans in critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part iii of this annual report on form k 
allowances for uncollectible accounts accounts receivable and secured advances to suppliers are stated at the historical carrying amounts net of write offs and allowances for uncollectible accounts 
we establish an allowance for uncollectible trade accounts receivable and secured advances to farmers based on historical experience  farming economic and other market conditions as well as specific identified customer collection issues 
uncollectible accounts are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount that is less than the outstanding historical balance or when we have determined that collection of the balance is unlikely 
we adopted the accounting guidance on disclosure about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses as of december  this guidance requires information to be disclosed at disaggregated levels  defined as portfolio segments and classes 
based upon its analysis of credit losses and risk factors to be considered in determining the allowance for credit losses  we have determined that the long term receivables from farmers in brazil is a single portfolio segment 
we evaluate this single portfolio segment by class of receivables  which is defined as a level of information below a portfolio segment in which the receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring risk 
we have identified accounts in legal collection processes and renegotiated amounts as classes of long term receivables from farmers 
valuation allowances for accounts in legal collection processes are determined on individual accounts based on the fair value of the collateral provided as security for the secured advance or credit sale 
the 
table of contents fair value is determined using a combination of internal and external resources  including published information concerning brazilian land values by region 
for determination of the valuation allowances for renegotiated amounts  we consider historical experience with the individual farmers  current weather and crop conditions  as well as the fair value of non crop collateral 
for both classes  a long term receivable from farmers in brazil is considered impaired  based on current information and events  if we determine it to be probable that all amounts due under the original terms of the receivable will not be collected 
recognition of interest income on secured advances to farmers is suspended once the farmer defaults on the originally scheduled delivery of agricultural commodities as the collection of future income is determined to not be probable 
no additional interest income is accrued from the point of default until ultimate recovery  where amounts collected are credited first against the receivable and then to any unrecognized income 
recoverable taxes we evaluate the collectibility of our recoverable taxes and record valuation allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful 
recoverable taxes primarily represent value added or other similar transactional taxes paid on the acquisition of raw materials and other services which can be recovered in cash or as compensation of outstanding balances against income taxes or certain other taxes we may owe 
management assumption about the collectibility of recoverable taxes requires significant judgment because it involves an assessment of the ability and willingness of the applicable federal or local government to refund the taxes 
the balance of these allowances fluctuates depending on the sales activity of existing inventories  purchases of new inventories  percentages of export sales  seasonality  changes in applicable tax rates  cash payment by the applicable government agencies and compensation of outstanding balances against income or certain other taxes owed to the applicable governments 
at december  and  the allowance for recoverable taxes was million and million  respectively 
we continue to monitor the economic environment and events taking place in the applicable countries and in cases where we determine that recovery is doubtful  recoverable taxes are reduced by allowances for the estimated unrecoverable amounts 
inventories and derivatives we use derivative instruments for the purpose of managing the exposures associated with agricultural commodity prices  transportation costs  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and energy costs and for positioning our overall portfolio relative to expected market movements in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we are exposed to loss in the event of non performance by counterparties to certain of these contracts 
the risk of non performance is routinely monitored and adjustments recorded  if necessary  to account for potential non performance 
different assumptions  changes in economic circumstances or the deterioration of the financial condition of the counterparties to these derivative instruments could result in additional fair value adjustments and increased expense reflected in cost of goods sold  foreign exchange or interest expense 
we did not have significant allowances relating to non performance by counterparties at december  and at december   we recorded allowances of million for current mark to market values of open positions and over the counter transactions related to non performance by specific customers  of which million was recorded in cost of goods sold and million was recorded as bad debt expense in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our readily marketable commodity inventories  forward purchase and sale contracts  and exchange traded futures and options are valued at fair value 
readily marketable inventories are freely traded  have quoted market prices  may be sold without significant additional processing and have predictable and insignificant disposal costs 
we estimate fair values of commodity inventories and forward purchase and sale contracts based on exchange quoted prices  adjusted for differences in local markets 
changes in the fair values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in our consolidated statements of 
table of contents income as a component of cost of goods sold 
if we used different methods or factors to estimate fair values  amounts reported as inventories and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts in the consolidated balance sheets and cost of goods sold could differ 
additionally  if market conditions change subsequent to year end  amounts reported in future periods as inventories  unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and cost of goods sold could differ 
property  plant and equipment and other intangible assets long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 
when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of property  plant and equipment assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the projected future cash flows to be generated by such assets 
if it appears that the carrying value of our assets is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against results of operations 
our judgments related to the expected useful lives of property  plant and equipment assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amount of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our property  plant and equipment assets  changes in these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges 
in  we recorded pretax non cash impairment charges of million in cost of goods sold  which consisted of million related to the write down of a european oilseed processing and refining facility that commenced operations in but has not reached its expected profitability  million related to the closure of an older  less efficient oilseed processing facility in the united states and a co located corn oil extraction line  million related to the closure of oilseed processing and refining facilities in europe with restructuring of our european footprint  million related to a long term supply contract acquired in connection with a wheat mill acquisition in brazil  million related to the write down of an older and less efficient brazilian distribution center and million related to the write down of an administrative office in brazil 
in  we recorded pretax non cash impairment charges of million in cost of goods sold in our agribusiness segment  relating to the permanent closure of a smaller  older and less efficient oilseed processing and refining facility in brazil 
in addition  we recorded million of pretax non cash impairment charges in selling  general and administrative expenses in our agribusiness segment  relating to the write down of certain real estate assets in south america 
the fair values of the real estate assets were determined by using third party valuations 
in  we recorded pretax non cash impairment charges of million and million in cost of goods sold in our agribusiness and edible oil products segments  respectively  relating to the permanent closures of a smaller  older and less efficient oilseed processing and refining facility in europe and a smaller  older and less efficient oilseed processing plant in the united states 
the fair values of land and equipment at these facilities were determined by using third party valuations 
investments in affiliates we continually review our equity investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge  including the length of time that the fair value of the investment is less than our carrying value  the financial condition  operating performance and near term prospects of the investment  which include general market conditions specific to the investment or the industry in which it operates  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery in fair value 
in  we recorded million of pretax non cash impairment charges in selling  general and administrative expenses in our agribusiness segment relating to an equity investment in a us biodiesel producer 
the fair value of this investment was determined utilizing 
table of contents projected cash flows of the biodiesel producer 
we did not have any significant impairment charges relating to our equity investments in or goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in a business acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
we use a two step process to test goodwill at the reporting unit level 
the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
fair value is estimated using discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on planned growth rates and estimates of discount rates 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the second step of the process is necessary 
the second step measures the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill 
to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  we compare the fair value of the intangible assets with their carrying values 
the fair values of indefinite lived intangible assets are determined using estimated discount rates 
if the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value  the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to its fair value 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
if estimates or related projections of the fair values of reporting units or indefinite lived intangible assets change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we performed our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarters of  and for the year ended december   we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in the milling products segment see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
there were no impairments of goodwill for the years ended december  and contingencies we are a party to a large number of claims and lawsuits  primarily tax and labor claims in brazil  arising in the normal course of business  and have accrued our estimate of the probable costs to resolve these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel and is based on an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
for more information on tax and labor claims in brazil  please see item legal proceedings 
employee benefit plans we sponsor various us and foreign pension and post retirement benefit plans 
in connection with the plans  we make various assumptions in the determination of projected benefit obligations and expense recognition related to pension and post retirement obligations 
key assumptions include discount rates  rates of return on plan assets  asset allocations and rates of future compensation increases 
management develops its assumptions based on its experience and by reference to market related data 
all assumptions are reviewed periodically and adjusted as necessary 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate on primarily the us and foreign defined benefit pension plans would increase annual expense by million and million  respectively  and would increase the projected benefit obligation by million and million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease annual expense by million on the us defined pension plans and have an immaterial effect on the expense of the foreign defined benefit plans and would increase the projected benefit obligation of the us and foreign defined pension plans by million and million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase or decrease 
table of contents in the long term return assumptions on our defined benefit pension plan assets would increase or decrease annual pension expense by million and million  respectively 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we are likely to realize 
we consider projections of future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies to assess the need for and the size of the valuation allowances 
if we determine that we can realize a deferred tax asset in excess of our net recorded amount  we decrease the valuation allowance  thereby increasing net income 
conversely  if we determine that we are unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset  we increase the valuation allowance  thereby decreasing net income 
prior to recording a valuation allowance  our deferred tax assets were  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
however  we have recorded valuation allowances of million and million at december  and  respectively  primarily representing the uncertainty regarding the recoverability of certain net operating loss carryforwards 
we apply a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and de recognition of tax benefits 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether it is more likely than not additional taxes will be due 
we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determined the liabilities are no longer necessary 
at december  and  we had recorded tax liabilities of million and million  respectively  in our consolidated balance sheets 
recent accounting pronouncements adoption of new accounting pronouncements amendment to consolidation in june  the fasb issued a standard that requires an enterprise to determine whether an entity is a variable interest entity vie  determine whether the enterprise has a controlling financial interest indicating it is a primary beneficiary of a vie  which would result in the enterprise being required to consolidate the vie in its financial statements  and provide enhanced disclosures about the enterprise involvement in vies 
as a result of the adoption of this standard on january   we consolidated one of our agribusiness joint ventures see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for transfers of financial assets in june  the fasb issued a standard that amended a previously issued standard to improve the information reported in financial statements related to the transfer of financial assets and the effects of the transfers of such assets on the financial position  results from operations and cash flows of the transferor and a transferor continuing involvement  if any  with transferred financial assets 
in addition  the amendment limits the circumstances in which a financial asset or a portion of a financial asset should be derecognized in the financial statements of the transferor when the transferor has not transferred the entire original financial asset 
upon adoption of this standard on january   all trade accounts receivables sold after that date under our accounts receivable securitization programs the securitization programs are included in trade accounts receivable and the amounts outstanding under the securitization programs are accounted for as secured borrowings and are reflected as short term debt on our consolidated balance sheets 
as a result of this adoption  we reduced our utilization of these programs and either terminated or allowed certain of these programs to expire 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position  results from operations or cash flows 

table of contents disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses in july  the fasb issued a standard that amended a previously issued standard requiring an entity to include additional disaggregated disclosures in their financial statements about their financing receivables  including credit risk disclosures and the allowance for credit losses 
entities with financing receivables will be required to disclose a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses  certain credit quality information  impaired loan information  modification information and past due information 
trade receivables with maturities of less than one year are excluded from the scope of the new disclosures 
as a result of the adoption of this standard  we have expanded our disclosures see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  but the adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our financial position  results from operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management as a result of our global operating and financing activities  we are exposed to changes in  among other things  agricultural commodity prices  transportation costs  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and energy costs which may affect our results of operations and financial position 
we actively monitor and manage these various market risks associated with our business activities 
our risk management decisions take place in various locations but exposure limits are centrally set and monitored 
we have a corporate risk management group  headed by our chief risk officer  which analyzes and monitors our risk exposures globally 
additionally  our board of directors finance and risk policy committee supervises  reviews and periodically revises our overall risk management policies and limits 
we use derivative instruments for the purpose of managing the exposures associated with commodity prices  transportation costs  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and energy costs and for positioning our overall portfolio relative to expected market movements in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we enter into derivative instruments primarily with major financial institutions  commodity exchanges in the case of commodity futures and options  or shipping companies in the case of ocean freight 
while these derivative instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  for hedged exposures those fluctuations are generally offset by the changes in fair value of the underlying exposures 
the derivative instruments that we use for hedging purposes are intended to reduce the volatility on our results of operations  however  they can occasionally result in earnings volatility  which may be material 
credit and counterparty risk through our normal business activities  we are subject to significant credit and counterparty risks that arise through normal commercial sales and purchases  including forward commitments to buy or sell  and through various other over the counter otc derivative instruments that we utilize to manage risks inherent in our business activities 
we define credit and counterparty risk as a potential financial loss due to the failure of a counterparty to honor its obligations 
the exposure is measured based upon several factors  including unpaid accounts receivable from counterparties and unrealized gains from otc derivative instruments including forward purchase and sale contracts 
we actively monitor credit and counterparty risk through credit analysis by local credit staffs and review by various local and corporate committees which monitor counterparty performance 
we record provisions for counterparty losses from time to time as a result of our credit and counterparty analysis 
during periods of tight conditions in global credit markets  downturns in regional or global economic conditions  and or significant price volatility  credit and counterparty risks are heightened 
this increased risk is monitored through  among other things  increased communication with key counterparties  management reviews and specific focus on counterparties or groups of counterparties that we may determine as high risk 
in addition  we have limited new credit extensions in certain cases and reduced our use of non exchange cleared derivative instruments 

table of contents commodities risk we operate in many areas of the food industry  from agricultural raw materials to the production and sale of branded food ingredients 
as a result  we purchase and produce various materials  many of which are agricultural commodities  including soybeans  soybean oil  soybean meal  softseeds including sunflower seed  rapeseed and canola and related oil and meal derived from them  wheat and corn 
in addition  we grow and purchase sugarcane to produce sugar  ethanol and electricity 
agricultural commodities are subject to price fluctuations due to a number of unpredictable factors that may create price risk 
as described above  we are also subject to the risk of counterparty non performance under forward purchase or sale contracts and from time to time have experienced instances of counterparty non performance  including as a result of significant declines in counterparty profitability under these contracts as a result of significant movements in commodity prices between the time in which the contracts were executed and the contractual forward delivery period 
we enter into various derivative contracts with the primary objective of managing our exposure to adverse price movements in the agricultural commodities used for and produced in our business operations 
we have established policies that limit the amount of unhedged fixed price agricultural commodity positions permissible for our operating companies  which are generally a combination of volume and value at risk var limits 
we measure and review our net commodities position on a daily basis 
our daily net agricultural commodity position consists of inventory  forward purchase and sale contracts  over the counter and exchange traded derivative instruments  including those used to hedge portions of our production requirements 
the fair value of that position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each agricultural commodity by valuing all of our commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period where available or utilizing a close proxy 
var is calculated on the net position and monitored at the and confidence intervals 
in addition  scenario analysis and stress testing are performed 
for example  one measure of market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices 
the results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  are as follows year ended december  year ended december  us in millions fair value market risk fair value market risk highest long position highest short position ocean freight risk ocean freight represents a significant portion of our operating costs 
the market price for ocean freight varies depending on the supply and demand for ocean vessels  global economic conditions and other factors 
we enter into time charter agreements for time on ocean freight vessels based on forecasted requirements for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities 
our time charter agreements generally have terms ranging from two months to approximately five years 
we use financial derivatives  known as freight forward agreements  to hedge portions of our ocean freight costs 
the ocean freight derivatives are included in other current assets and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
a portion of the ocean freight derivatives have been designated as fair value hedges of our firm commitments to purchase time on ocean freight vessels 
changes in the fair value of the ocean freight derivatives that are qualified  designated and highly effective as a fair value hedge  along with the gain or loss on the hedged firm commitments to purchase time on ocean freight vessels that is attributable to the hedged risk  are recorded in earnings 
there was no material gain or loss recognized in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december   on the firm commitments to purchase time on ocean freight vessels nor any gain or loss on freight derivative 
table of contents contracts 
there was no material gain or loss recognized in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  due to hedge ineffectiveness 
in the year ended december   we recognized gains of million in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income related to the amortization of amounts recorded in current and non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
energy risk we purchase various energy commodities such as bunker fuel  electricity and natural gas that are used to operate our manufacturing facilities and ocean freight vessels 
the energy commodities are subject to price risk 
we use financial derivatives  including exchange traded and otc swaps and options  with the primary objective of hedging portions of our energy exposure 
these energy derivatives are included in other current assets and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
currency risk our global operations require active participation in foreign exchange markets 
our primary foreign currency exposures are the brazilian real  the euro and other european currencies  the argentine peso and the chinese yuan renminbi 
to reduce the risk arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations we enter into derivative instruments  such as forward contracts and swaps  and to a lesser extent  foreign currency options 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the related currency exposures 
the potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates as of december  was not material 
when determining our exposure  we exclude intercompany loans that are deemed to be permanently invested 
the repayments of permanently invested intercompany loans are not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future and therefore are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
as a result  the foreign exchange gains and losses on these borrowings are excluded from the determination of net income and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
included in other comprehensive income loss are foreign exchange gains of million for the year ended december  and losses of million for the year ended december   related to permanently invested intercompany loans 
interest rate risk we have debt in fixed and floating rate instruments 
we are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure related to our debt portfolio 
the aggregate fair value of our short and long term debt  based on market yields at december   was  million with a carrying value of  million 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the interest yields on our debt at december  would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of our debt 
similarly  a decrease of basis points in the interest yields on our debt at december  would cause an increase of approximately million in the fair value of our debt 
a hypothetical change in libor would result in a change of approximately million in our interest expense 
some of our variable rate debt is denominated in currencies other than in us dollars and is indexed to non us dollar based interest rate indices  such as euribor and tjlp 
as such  the hypothetical change in interest rate ignores the impact from any currency movements 

table of contents derivative instruments interest rate derivatives the interest rate swaps used by us as hedging instruments have been recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded contemporaneously in earnings 
additionally  the carrying amount of the associated debt is adjusted through earnings for changes in the fair value arising from changes in benchmark interest rates 
ineffectiveness as defined in a fasb issued standard is recognized to the extent that these two adjustments do not offset 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of managing certain of our interest rate exposures 
certain of these swap agreements have been designated as fair value hedges within the guidance of a fasb issued standard 
in addition  we have entered into certain interest rate basis swap agreements that do not qualify for hedge accounting  and therefore we have not designated these swap agreements as hedge instruments for accounting purposes 
as a result  changes in fair value of the interest rate basis swap agreements are recorded as an adjustment to earnings 
the following table summarizes our outstanding interest rate swap and interest rate basis swap agreements as of december  us in millions  except percentages notional amount of hedged obligation notional amount of derivative interest rate swap agreements weighted average rate payable weighted average rate receivable interest rate basis swap agreements weighted average rate payable weighted average rate receivable interest is payable in arrears based on the average daily effective federal funds rate  three month us dollar libor and six month us libor prevailing during the respective period plus a spread

the interest rate swap agreements mature in and we recognized approximately million  million  and million as a reduction in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income in the years ended december   and  respectively  relating to our outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
in addition  in  and  we recognized gains of approximately million  million and million  respectively  as a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated statements of income  related to the amortization of deferred gains on termination of interest rate swap agreements 
we reclassified approximately million of loss in and million in each of the years and from accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income  which related to settlements of certain derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges  in connection with forecasted issuances of debt financing 
in  we redeemed the debt related to these cash flow hedges see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign exchange derivatives we use a combination of foreign exchange forward and option contracts in certain of our operations to mitigate the risk from exchange rate fluctuations in connection with anticipated sales denominated in foreign currencies 
the foreign exchange forward and option contracts are designated as cash flow hedges 
we also use net investment hedges to partially offset the translation adjustments arising from the remeasurement of our investments in brazilian subsidiaries 
we assess  both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the hedged items

commodity derivatives we use derivative instruments to manage exposure to movements associated with agricultural commodity prices 
we generally use exchange traded futures and options contracts to minimize the effects of changes in the prices of agricultural commodities on our agricultural commodity inventories and forward purchase and sale contracts  but may also from time to time enter into otc commodity transactions  including swaps  which are settled in cash at maturity or termination based on exchange quoted futures prices 
changes in fair values of exchange traded futures contracts representing the unrealized gains and or losses on these instruments are settled daily generally through our wholly owned futures clearing subsidiary 
forward purchase and sale contracts are primarily settled through delivery of agricultural commodities 
while we consider these exchange traded futures and forward purchase and sale contracts to be effective economic hedges  we do not designate or account for the majority of our commodity contracts as hedges 
changes in fair values of these contracts and related readily marketable agricultural commodity inventories are included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income 
the forward contracts require performance of both us and the contract counterparty in future periods 
contracts to purchase agricultural commodities generally relate to current or future crop years for delivery periods quoted by regulated commodity exchanges 
contracts for the sale of agricultural commodities generally do not extend beyond one future crop cycle 

table of contents in addition  we hedge portions of our forecasted oilseed processing production requirements  including forecasted purchases of soybeans and sales of soy commodity products 
the instruments used are generally exchange traded futures contracts 
such contracts hedging us oilseed processing activities qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges 
such contracts that are used as economic hedges of other global oilseed processing activities generally do not qualify for hedge accounting as a result of location differences and are therefore not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes
