general we are currently focusing our efforts on new and patented pharmaceutical products mostly based on our patented drug delivery technology known as nexact and leveraging the know how of our cro business to assist in our product and nexact technology development 
in  through the acquisition of bio quant  we have expanded our research and development capabilities with nexact into the areas of oncology  inflammation  immunology  and metabolic diseases 
our strategy  starting in the fourth quarter of and beyond  is to continue diverting the bio quant cro s revenue generating capacity to our own technology and pipeline development projects so that we can generate sufficient data to attract commercial and development partners to license both our nexact technology and pipeline products 
in addition  we are conducting additional studies to extend the validation of the nexact technology into the oral  subcutaneous  ocular and rectal delivery of classes of drugs for these and other indications 
bio quant continues to generate revenues through performing services for outside clients in order to off set the costs of our own internal product and technology development at bio quant 
we intend to continue our efforts developing topical treatments based on the application of nexact technology to drugs previously approved by the us food and drug administration fda  with proven efficacy and safety profiles  with patents expiring in the near term or expired and with proven market track records and potential 
we are also seeking commercialization partnerships for our existing pipeline products such as vitaros  mycova  femprox and prevonco and we our enhancing our business development efforts by offering potential partners clearly defined regulatory paths for our products under development 
our lead product  vitaros  was approved for commercialization in canada in november  we are in late stage discussions with several major pharmaceutical companies in canada to commercialize the product in canada 
we expect to sign a commercial partnership for canada in and receive up front payments with sales milestones and royalties to be paid upon commercialization of the product 
we expect to sign a commercialization partnership deal in the second half of and then start receiving royalty revenues from sales of the product during the second half of or the first half of next we plan to file for commercialization approval in europe in the second half of further  our expectation is to sign a commercialization partnership similar to canada for a number of the major european countries in we have already signed a partnership in italy with bracco whereby we expect to receive  before the end of q as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that if vitaros is approved in europe in late  we will start to receive royalty revenues beginning in for the major markets described above 
this strategy of licensing products and product candidates is expected to continue in future years for prevonco  mycova and femprox which are our other late stage products 
we also intend to actively promote the nexact technology to companies seeking innovative alternatives and solutions to their development problems 
we will actively seek to start licensing our drug delivery technology  nexact  to pharmaceutical partners for their own product development 
in these commercial partnership deals we expect that we would license our technology in exchange for a royalty on the annual sales of our commercial partners products containing nexact 
although it is unlikely that we would receive any royalty revenues under these arrangements prior to  we are currently talking to potential partners and expect to sign our first nexact technology license in where we would receive up front payments and milestone payments at a later time 
to date we have signed several material transfer agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
these companies are in the validation phase of the use of our nexact with their compounds and drugs 
liquidity  capital resources and financial condition 
we have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations each year since our inception 
through december   we had an accumulated deficit of  and our operations have principally been financed through private placements of equity securities and debt financing 
funds raised in past periods  including approximately  during from the sale of common stock and units see note to the consolidated financial statements  should not be considered an indication of our ability to raise additional funds in any future periods 
we expect to be cash flow positive in and with the goal of becoming profitable in subject to the timing of revenue recognition of license revenues as we anticipate entering into out licensing agreements for our nexact technology with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide 
we also are actively pursuing partnering opportunities for our clinical stage nexact based and non nexact based candidates in the areas of oncology  inflammation  dermatology  pain  autoimmune diseases and sexual dysfunction 
the successful licensing of one or more of these candidates and or the nexact technology itself would be expected to generate additional revenues for funding our current operations and long term growth strategy 
even if we are successful in obtaining partners who can assume the funding for further development of our products  we may still encounter additional obstacles such as our research and development activities may not be successful  our products may not prove to be safe and effective  clinical development work may not be completed in a timely manner or at all  and the anticipated products may not be commercially viable or successfully marketed 
should we not be able to find development partners in  we would require external financing to fund our operations and we may not achieve our goals of being cash flow positive or becoming profitable from operations in our current cash reserves of approximately million as of the date of this report  which includes approximately  received from the exercise of warrants issued as part of our common stock and warrant offering as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements and approximately million  net of commissions  from the sale of approximately  shares of common stock pursuant to sales agreement with brinson patrick securities corporation as discussed in note the sales agreement of the consolidated financial statements  should provide us with sufficient cash to fund our operations into the third quarter of this projection is based on the monthly operating expenses of maintaining our public listing together with maintaining bio quant s revenue at a level consistent with our current cash reserves also include  in up front payments as a result of entering into exclusive license agreements with elis pharmaceuticals ltd 
elis and neopharm group neopharm for vitaros as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
to the extent we sign additional licensing agreements in and receive up front and milestone payments for one or more of our product pipeline candidates and or the nexact technology itself  our cash reserves would provide us with sufficient cash to fund our operations well into additionally  as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  we still have approximately million available to raise through the sale of our common stock per the s shelf registration statement filed in connection with the sales agreement 
there can be no assurances  however  that we will be able to continue to raise additional capital as may be needed  meet our operating expenses or obtain additional licensing agreements 
if we are unable to raise additional capital as may be needed  meet our projections for operating expenses or obtain additional licensing agreements  it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or require us to cease or significantly delay some of our development programs 
at december  we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million as compared to  at december  during  our net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million as a result of the issuance of convertible notes as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements and from the sale of common stock as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the receipt of this cash during was offset by our capital expenditures of approximately  and our cash used in operations of approximately million 
our cash used in operating activities during includes approximately  in proceeds received during the year from the sale of our new jersey net operating losses in during our bio quant cro had a net cash outflow of approximately  our administrative overhead  including public company expenses  is approximately  per month 
additionally  we spent approximately  for our annual audit fee   in costs associated with three shareholder meetings held during the period   in legal fees for various transactions including the notes issued and common stock sold as discussed in notes and of the consolidated financial statements  the special meetings of our shareholders held in march and september  and also fees related to the acquisition of bio quant in we also spent approximately million for the development of our nexact technology and related pipeline products as well as approximately  for related business development efforts 
during  we spent approximately  in severance and accrued vacation paid as part of our restructuring program implemented in december   in costs related to managing our building in east windsor  nj before the tenant took occupancy in february   in legal fees related to new patent applications for our nexact technology and  for legal fees in connection with a patent lawsuit in which we are the plaintiff suing for patent infringement on our herpes treatment medical device 
the suit was settled in for  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following is a brief description of the more significant accounting policies and related estimate methods that we follow income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates of our current tax exposure and temporary differences resulting from timing differences for reporting items for book and tax purposes 
we recognize deferred taxes by the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in addition  valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
critical estimate in consideration of our accumulated losses and lack of historical ability to generate taxable income to utilize our deferred tax assets  we have estimated that we will not be able to realize any benefit from our temporary differences and have recorded a full valuation allowance 
if we become profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the net operating loss carry forward  we would immediately record the estimated net realized value of the deferred tax asset at that time and would then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates  which would be approximately under current tax laws 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
long lived assets we review for the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
if such assets are considered impaired  the amount of the impairment loss recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  fair value being determined based upon discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the asset 
critical estimate in and we had initiated efforts to sell the facility housing our corporate office  research and development laboratories and manufacturing plant located in east windsor  new jersey 
we have performed a review for impairment of our facility based on discussions with our real estate agent regarding the likely selling price of our facility and the commercial real estate market in general 
accordingly  in we took a write down of approximately  to the carrying value of the facility to approximate the current market value 
overestimating the potential selling price of our facility in a planned sale may lead to overstating the carrying value of the manufacturing facility by not identifying an impairment loss 
intangible assets we review for the impairment of intangible assets  including goodwill  on an annual basis 
the first step of the impairment test requires that the company determine the fair value of each reporting unit  and compare the fair value to the reporting unit carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform a second more detailed impairment assessment 
the second impairment assessment involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date 
critical estimate application of the goodwill and intangible assets impairment test requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for the businesses  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of the company weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or conclusions on goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
at december   we determined that the value of goodwill is impaired and a charge of  was recorded to write off the entire value of goodwill 
the decision to write off the goodwill was based on an assessment of the fair value of the bio quant pre clinical cro business segment 
such impairment was derived mainly from the fact that bio quant significantly changed its strategic focus in the fourth quarter of rather than serve the greater cro market  bio quant is primarily performing cro services for the company s own pharmaceutical product development segment 
as such  the ongoing revenue  profits and cash flows for bio quant have been significantly reduced from the initial projections for bio quant when it was acquired by the company in december additionally  we have taken an impairment charge of  to write down the fair value of know how to  as a result of the bio quant cro shifting its focus from growing revenues and generating increased positive cash flow to largely supporting our research and development business segment which designs and develops pharmaceutical products 
revenue recognition revenues from bio quant s performance of pre clinical services are recognized according to the proportional performance method whereby revenue is recognized as performance has occurred  based on the relative outputs of the performance that has occurred up to that point in time under the respective agreement  typically the delivery of report data to our clients which documents the results of our pre clinical testing services 
revenues from product sales are recognized upon delivery of products to customers  less allowances for returns and discounts 
royalty revenue is recognized upon the sale of the related products as reported to us by our distribution partner  provided the royalty amounts are fixed or determinable and the amounts are considered collectible 
revenues earned under license and research and development contracts are recognized in accordance with the cost to cost method whereby the extent of progress toward completion is measured on the cost to cost basis  however  revenue recognized at any point will not exceed the cash received 
if the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract cost indicate a loss  a provision for the entire loss on the contract would be made 
all costs related to these agreements are expensed as incurred and classified within research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
research and development expenses include costs directly attributable to the conduct of our research and development  including salaries  payroll taxes  employee benefits  materials  supplies  depreciation on and maintenance of research equipment  costs related to research and development fee agreements  the cost of services provided by outside contractors  including services related to our clinical trials  clinical trial expenses  the full cost of manufacturing drugs for use in research  pre clinical and clinical development  and the allocable portion of facility costs 
also  licensing agreements typically include several elements of revenue  such as up front payments  milestones  royalties upon sales of product  and the delivery of product and or research services to the licensor 
non refundable license fees received upon execution of license agreements where we have continuing involvement are deferred and recognized as revenue over the estimated performance period of the agreement 
this requires management to estimate the expected term of the agreement or  if applicable  the estimated life of its licensed patents 
in addition  we evaluate our arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
for example  a license agreement with a pharmaceutical company may involve a license  research and development activities and or contract manufacturing 
management is required to determine if the separate components of the agreement have value on a standalone basis and qualify as separate units of accounting  whereby consideration is allocated based upon their relative fair values or  if not  the consideration should be allocated based upon the residual method 
accordingly  up front and development stage milestone payments are and will be deferred and recognized as revenue over the performance period of such license agreement 
critical estimate in calculating the relative outputs of the performance that have occurred under the proportional performance method for our pre clinical testing services  we must determine whether we have delivered sufficient value to recognize a portion of the contract services revenue and to estimate what percentage of the total costs has been incurred at any given point in time 
in calculating the progress made toward completion of a research contract or licensing agreement  we must compare costs incurred to date to the total estimated cost of the project and or estimate the performance period 
we estimate the cost and or performance period of any given project based on our past experience in product development as well as the past experience of our research staff in their areas of expertise 
underestimating the proportion of final data generated for pre clinical testing services or the total cost and or performance period of a research contract or licensing agreement may cause us to accelerate the revenue recognized under such contract 
conversely  overestimating the proportion of final data for pre clinical testing services or the cost of a research contract may cause us to delay revenue recognized 
stock based compensation in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we must calculate the value of stock options issued to employees  non employee contractors and warrants issued to investors 
the fair value of each option and warrant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model is a generally accepted method of estimating the value of stock options and warrants 
critical estimate the black scholes option pricing model requires us to estimate the company s dividend yield rate  expected volatility and risk free interest rate over the life of the option 
inaccurately estimating any one of these factors may cause the value of the option to be under or over estimated 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for the current estimates used in the black scholes pricing model 
comparison of results of operations between the years ended december  and as there was only one segment for almost all of  segment information regarding the results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was not included 
revenue 
we recorded  in revenue in  as compared to  in revenue during the revenue is primarily attributable to the sale of the us rights of vitaros to warner as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the revenue is almost entirely attributable to the sales of cro services by our bio quant cro 
we expect to continue to see this level of revenue remain relatively constant with minimal growth from our bio quant cro in as it continues to divert its resources to support our nexact technology and product pipeline research and development 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses for and were  and  respectively 
while we began to reduce our research and development expenses in and early  we have now begun to increase our research and development expenses again as a result of the acquisition of bio quant in december we expect to see an increase in research and development spending in as a result of the acquisition of bio quant and the expansion of our nexact technology into the areas of oncology  inflammation  immunology  and metabolic diseases in addition to new delivery routes of our nexact technology 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses were  during as compared to  during the same period in the increase is due to approximately million of stock compensation expense recorded during in as compared to approximately  in as restricted share grants contingent upon stockholder approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares in the nexmed  inc stock incentive plan the plan were awarded in may and afterward upon approval of such shares as discussed in note of consolidated financial statements 
we also incurred higher expenses in in connection with three shareholder meetings held during the first nine months of whereas there were no such meetings in additionally  there was an increase in expenses in related to the general and administrative expenses of our bio quant cro business which was acquired in december and therefore incurred an entire year of such expenses in we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will not exceed this level in interest expense 
we had interest expense of  during  as compared to  during the same period in a significant amount of the interest expense is the result of non cash interest expense recognized on the beneficial conversion feature of the convertible mortgage notes and notes payable as discussed in notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
non cash interest expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the non cash interest expense was significantly higher in due to the beneficial conversion feature of the convertible mortgage notes in there was no such beneficial conversion feature related to the convertible mortgage notes in net loss 
the net loss was  or per share in as compared to net loss of  or per share during although there was a decrease in non cash interest expense in as discussed above  we incurred an impairment charge to goodwill and intangible assets of  as discussed in notes  and of the consolidated financial statements which offset the decrease in net loss realized from the decrease in interest expense 
comparison of results of operations between the years ended december  and the revenues and expenses of bio quant included in the consolidated financial statements represent days of activity in  from the date of the closing of the acquisition through december  as such  the activity is not significant to review in the comparison of the results of operations below 
please see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements to see a pro forma presentation as if the acquisition had taken place in revenues 
we recorded revenues of  during as compared to  during the higher revenue is primarily attributable to the milestone payments received in from novartis under the licensing agreement for nm as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we received million from novartis in march and another million in october these milestones were recognized as revenue during we recognized no revenue from novartis in we expect revenues to increase significantly in with the additional revenue to be generated by the bio quant cro business during the entire year in research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses decreased from  in to  in research and development expenses significantly decreased in due to reduced spending in on our development programs as part of our restructuring program 
during  we reduced our research and development staff and infrastructure 
we expect to see an increase in research and development spending in as a result of the acquisition of bio quant and the expansion of our nexact technology into the areas of oncology  inflammation  immunology  and metabolic diseases 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses decreased from  in to  in the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in staff costs as a result of our restructuring program implemented in december along with a reduction in legal fees related to our patents as we expended over  during for one time national filings of patent applications related to vitaros 
interest expense 
we recognized  and  in interest expense in and  respectively 
the increased interest expense is the result of imputed interest expense recognized as a result of beneficial conversions of the convertible mortgage note as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
non cash interest expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net loss 
the net loss was  or per share and  or per share in and  respectively 
the significant increase in net loss is the result of imputed interest expense recognized as a result of beneficial conversions of the convertible mortgage note as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements
