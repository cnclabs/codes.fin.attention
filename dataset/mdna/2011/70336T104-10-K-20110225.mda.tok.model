item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading producer of thermal coal in the eastern us  with operations and coal reserves in the appalachia and the illinois basin coal regions 
we are also a leading us producer of metallurgical quality coal 
our principal business is the mining and preparation of thermal coal  for sale primarily to electricity generators  and metallurgical coal  for sale to steel mills and independent coke producers 
our operations consist of fourteen active mining complexes  which include company operated mines  contractor operated mines and coal preparation facilities 
the appalachia and illinois basin segments consist of our operations in west virginia and kentucky  respectively 
we ship coal to electricity generators  industrial users  steel mills and independent coke producers 
in  we sold million tons of coal  of which was sold to domestic electricity generators and was sold to domestic and global steel producers 
in  we sold million tons of coal  of which was sold to domestic electricity generators and was sold to domestic and global steel producers 
coal is shipped via various company owned and third party loading facilities  multiple rail and river transportation routes and ocean going vessels 
we typically sell coal to utility and steel making customers under contracts with terms of one year or more 
approximately and of our sales were under such contracts during and  respectively 
effective october   patriot was spun off from peabody 
the spin off was accomplished through a dividend of all outstanding shares of patriot  resulting in patriot becoming a separate  public company traded on the new york stock exchange symbol pcx 
on july   patriot completed the acquisition of magnum 
magnum was one of the largest coal producers in appalachia  operating eight mining complexes with production from surface and underground mines and controlling more than million tons of proven and probable coal reserves 
magnum s results are included as of the date of the acquisition 

table of contents results of operations segment adjusted ebitda the discussion of our results of operations below includes references to and analysis of our appalachia and illinois basin segments adjusted ebitda results 
adjusted ebitda is defined as net income loss before deducting interest income and expense  income taxes  reclamation and remediation obligation expense  depreciation  depletion and amortization  restructuring and impairment charge  and net sales contract accretion 
net sales contract accretion represents contract accretion excluding back to back coal purchase and sales contracts 
the contract accretion on the back to back coal purchase and sales contracts reflects the accretion related to certain coal purchase and sales contracts existing prior to july   whereby magnum purchased coal from third parties to fulfill tonnage commitments on sales contracts 
adjusted ebitda is used by management as a measure of our segments operating performance 
we believe that in our industry such information is a relevant measurement of a company s operating financial performance 
because adjusted ebitda and segment adjusted ebitda are not calculated identically by all companies  our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
segment adjusted ebitda is calculated the same as adjusted ebitda but also excludes selling  general and administrative expenses  past mining obligation expense and gain on disposal or exchange of assets and is reconciled to its most comparable measure below  under net income loss 
adjusted ebitda is reconciled to its most comparable measure under generally accepted accounting principles in item selected consolidated financial data 
geologic conditions our results of operations are impacted by geologic conditions as they relate to coal mining 
these conditions refer to the physical nature of the coal seam and surrounding strata and its effect on the mining process 
geologic conditions that can have an adverse effect on underground mining include thinning coal seam thickness  rock partings within a coal seam  weak roof or floor rock  sandstone channel intrusions  groundwater and increased stresses within the surrounding rock mass due to over mining  under mining and overburden changes 
the term adverse geologic conditions is used in general to refer to these and similar situations where the geologic setting can negatively affect the normal mining process 
adverse geologic conditions would be markedly different from those that would be considered typical geologic conditions for a given mine 
since approximately of our production was sourced from underground operations  geologic conditions can be a major factor in our results of operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  summary our segment adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  increased compared to the prior year primarily due to higher average sales prices and cost savings resulting from the suspension of certain higher cost mining operations in in  we implemented a strategic response to the then weakened coal markets 
as a result  we suspended certain mining operations  which in certain circumstances remained suspended throughout the increase in segment adjusted ebitda was partially offset by decreased sales volumes during sales volume decreases in resulted from the closure of the harris no 
mine in june  and certain mine suspensions  lower production due to more employee time spent with regulators related to inspections at certain of our mines  as well as roof falls at the harris and highland mines 
while increased employee time spent on inspections resulted in lower production  these inspections did not result in increased citations 
due to the nature of our business  we incur a significant amount of fixed costs and  therefore  lower sales volumes contributed to a higher cost per ton 
in june  we announced the closure of the harris no 
mine due to the roof fall on the primary conveyor belt  adverse geologic conditions in the travel entries of the mine and employee safety concerns 
the harris no 
mine was nearing the end of its projected mining life and was scheduled for closure in we recorded a restructuring and impairment charge related to the closure of the harris no 
mine and further rationalization of our operations at the rocklick mining complex 
our panther and federal mining complexes both had major longwall moves and related downtime in our federal longwall was idled for almost two weeks in september as a result of msha enforcement actions that were subsequently vacated 
previously  our federal mine had temporarily suspended active mining operations in late february  upon discovering potentially adverse atmospheric conditions in an abandoned area of the mine 
in september  we recorded an adjustment of million to reclamation and remediation expense as a result of adjusting our estimated selenium remediation costs of three apogee outfalls based on the new technologies required to be used for water treatment at certain locations due to the september  court ruling

tons sold and revenues revenues in the appalachia segment were higher for the year ended december  compared to the prior year primarily due to higher average sales prices for both thermal and metallurgical coal during the higher average sales prices were driven largely by increased metallurgical coal sales volume as a result of our panther and winchester mines product being sold on the metallurgical market rather than the thermal market during these increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes related to the suspension of various mines  which in certain circumstances remained suspended throughout  such as the samples mine 
revenues in the illinois basin segment were higher for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily due to higher average sales prices  partially offset by decreased sales volumes 
decreased sales volumes resulted from lower production caused by difficult geologic conditions including roof falls at our highland mine during and shifting to new mine sections at our bluegrass mining complex 
in addition  more employee time has been spent with regulators related to inspections throughout  particularly at highland  which impacted production volumes 
appalachia other revenue was lower for the year ended december  primarily due to cash settlements received for reduced shipments in as a result of renegotiated customer agreements 
segment operating costs and expenses segment operating costs and expenses for appalachia for the year ended december  decreased as compared to the prior year 
in relation to the closing or idling of certain mines and the reduction in utilization of one of our preparation plants in the second half of  we had decreased contract mining costs million  labor costs million and fuel and explosives  taxes  lease and royalty expenses million during these decreases were partially offset by increased purchased coal million 
the increased purchased coal costs included purchases of thermal coal to cover certain thermal sales commitments at our panther and winchester mines  where production is now being sold as a metallurgical product 
operating costs and expenses also benefited in from an increase in income from equity affiliates million as compared to the prior year 
patriot established two separate joint ventures in designed to produce high quality metallurgical coal 
these investments are beginning to generate more income  as the related mining properties continue to increase production 

table of contents segment operating costs and expenses for the illinois basin increased for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due to increased labor as a result of additional shifts and higher wages million  increased fuel and explosives expense primarily related to higher costs million and additional repairs and maintenance activity million 
higher repair and maintenance costs related to additional belting repairs and roof bolting  as well as equipment maintenance 
costs were also negatively impacted by several roof falls at our highland mine and heightened regulatory inspections throughout most of segment adjusted ebitda our segment adjusted ebitda for appalachia was higher for the year ended december  compared to the prior year primarily due to higher average sales prices and lower costs resulting from suspended or reduced production at certain mining operations  in particular some of our higher cost operations  in response to the economic recession experienced throughout these increases were partially offset by decreased sales volumes in and a decrease in non recurring settlements from renegotiated customer agreements as compared to segment adjusted ebitda for the illinois basin decreased for the year ended december  from the prior year primarily due to higher operating costs

the increase was partially offset by lower costs related to suspended operations 
the results included reduction in workforce costs related to suspended mines  primarily samples 
net gain on disposal or exchange of assets net gain on disposal or exchange of assets increased for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
in  net gain on disposal or exchange of assets included a gain of million in the fourth quarter  a gain of million in the third quarter  gains of million on two transactions in the second quarter and a gain of million in the first quarter 
all of the gains were a result of exchange transactions for mineral interests 
in  net gain on disposal or exchange of assets included a million gain on the exchange of surface land and coal mineral rights for certain mineral interests from two exchange transactions 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense partially offset by a net decrease in stock based compensation expense due to a significant forfeiture in the third quarter 

table of contents depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  primarily due to lower volumes associated with certain mines being closed or suspended in the second half of and due to the full depreciation of a significant number of assets associated with our magnum acquisition 
these decreases were partially offset by increased depreciation at our blue creek complex  which began operations in december reclamation and remediation obligation expense reclamation and remediation obligation expense increased for the year ended december  primarily due to remediation expense related to the selenium liability assumed in the july magnum acquisition  which was recorded at fair value upon finalization of purchase accounting in june additional remediation expense of million was recorded in the third quarter of as a result of adjusting our estimated future costs of selenium remediation at certain outfalls resulting from requirements of the september  court ruling 
see liquidity and capital resources september  us district court ruling for further description of the ruling and the adjustments 
sales contract accretion sales contract accretion decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due to certain contracts assumed in the magnum acquisition expiring in restructuring and impairment charge in the second quarter of  we recorded a million restructuring and impairment charge related to the june closure of the harris no 
mine  resulting from adverse geologic conditions  and further rationalization of our operations at the rocklick mining complex based on this early closure 
the charge included a million impairment charge related to equipment and coal reserves that were abandoned due to the mine closure and a restructuring component of million for payment of obligations that will be made with no future economic benefit for remaining operational contracts 
for the year ended december   we incurred a million impairment charge related to certain infrastructure and thermal coal reserves near our rocklick complex that were deemed uneconomical to mine  as well as a million restructuring charge related to the discontinued use of a beltline into the rocklick preparation plant during the fourth quarter of interest expense interest expense increased for the year ended december  primarily due to the million of senior notes issued on may  as well as the increased amortization of deferred financing costs related to the new notes  accounts receivable securitization program entered into in march  and the amended and restated credit agreement entered into in may in addition  we incurred additional interest expense in due to the blue creek preparation plant capital lease that began in may interest income interest income decreased for the year ended december  compared to the prior year due to the collection of certain black lung excise tax refunds and related interest during income tax provision for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million related to certain state taxes 
for the year ended december   no income tax provision was recorded 
no federal income tax provision was recorded in or due to our tax net operating loss for each respective year and the full valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
the primary difference between book and taxable income for and was the treatment of the net sales contract accretion on the below market purchase and sales contracts acquired in the july magnum acquisition  with such amounts being included in the computation of book income but excluded from the computation of taxable income 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  summary revenues were  million  an increase of million  and segment adjusted ebitda was million  an increase of million  for the year ended december  the increase in revenue and segment adjusted ebitda resulted from the addition of magnum  the successful implementation of our management action plan and improved performance at our longwall mines 
beginning in the third quarter of  the global recession resulted in decreased worldwide demand for steel and electricity  leading to weakened coal markets 
early in  we implemented a management action plan as a strategic response to the weakened coal markets 
the management action plan included output and cost reductions  workforce and capital redeployment and sales contract renegotiations 
as a result of this plan  during we suspended certain company operated and contract mines  including suspension of operations at our samples surface mine  deferred production start up at one newly developed mining complex and cancelled certain operating shifts at various other mining complexes 
additionally  we restructured certain below market legacy coal supply agreements 

table of contents our results reflect the inclusion of a full year of the magnum operations  which were acquired on july  the increased revenue from the acquired magnum operations was partially offset by lower customer demand throughout the year and increased customer deferrals during both our federal and panther longwalls encountered some adverse geologic conditions in  but significantly less than the difficulties encountered in the improved production in reflects the benefits of mine plan adjustments made in late to minimize the impact of difficult geology 
in the third quarter of  significant upgrades were made to certain components of the panther longwall mining equipment 
both of the longwalls were performing well by the end of in the fourth quarter of  federal had its best production quarter in and panther had its best quarter since the magnum acquisition

these increases were partially offset by lower customer demand and increased customer deferrals 
sales volumes in the appalachia segment increased in  primarily from the incremental million tons sold from the acquired magnum operations  partially offset by the overall decline in customer demand for both metallurgical and thermal coal including lower sales due to customer shipment deferrals and settlements 
the overall decline in customer demand led to the suspension of certain operations and decreased operating shifts at other operations 
illinois basin revenue decreased slightly in compared to the prior year primarily due to lower sales volume caused by lower customer demand  unfavorable weather conditions early in the year and increased downtime due to regulatory inspections 
lower sales volumes were partially offset by higher average sales prices 

table of contents appalachia other revenue was higher in primarily due to cash settlements received for reduced shipments as a result of renegotiated customer agreements 
in addition to royalty income  appalachia other revenue in included a structured settlement on a property transaction  a settlement for past due coal royalties which had previously been fully reserved due to the uncertainty of collection  and gains on the sale of purchased coal in the first quarter 
segment operating costs and expenses segment operating costs and expenses represent consolidated operating costs and expenses less past mining obligations 
segment operating costs and expenses for appalachia increased in as compared to the prior year primarily due to the incremental million of costs for the full year of the acquired magnum operations 
excluding the impact of magnum  operating costs were higher due to increased purchased coal million and increased materials and supplies costs primarily related to equipment rebuilds at various locations million 
we purchased coal to cover certain sales commitments at some of our suspended operations 
the increased costs were partially offset by decreased labor costs primarily due to reduced shifts and mine suspensions as a result of lower customer demand million and lower royalties resulting from decreased production at certain mines million 
operating costs and expenses for illinois basin decreased in as compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased costs for purchased coal million and lower diesel fuel and explosives costs million

the decreased costs were partially offset by higher repair and maintenance and outside services costs primarily due to major non recurring repairs including equipment rebuilds  belting and component upgrades million 
segment adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda for appalachia increased in from the prior year primarily due to the contribution from the additional volume associated with the acquired magnum operations 
additionally  during  we received cash settlements for reduced shipments 
these cash settlements approximated the financial impact associated with cancelled customer commitments 
segment adjusted ebitda for the illinois basin decreased in primarily due to lower production volumes attributable to lower customer demand and severe winter storms 
this decrease also reflected higher repair and maintenance and outside services costs that were primarily due to major non recurring repairs including equipment rebuilds  belting and component upgrades

outlook market metallurgical coal markets are showing continued strength 
we anticipate that the metallurgical coal market will remain strong throughout  given the expectation for continued growth in economies around the world 
recent weather conditions  such as the extreme rain in australia  have made the markets even tighter 
we believe this constrained supply is setting the stage for higher pricing in we believe this structural shortage in metallurgical coal will continue for at least the next few years 
this shortage is a result of limited supply in established coal basins  coupled with long lead times to bring on significant production in new basins 
in thermal coal markets  key indicators are favorable 
in the seaborne thermal market  the forward price for coal delivered during into northern europe has increased approximately per metric tonne from the end of october to february as a result  appalachia and illinois basin thermal coal can now frequently be sold into the european market at more favorable margins than if sold domestically 
we believe this is an indication of the continuing globalization of thermal markets  following the same pattern as metallurgical markets in recent years 
in late and early  we entered into contracts to export nearly one million tons of thermal coal to europe in including shipments from all three of the basins where we operate 
the global increase in metallurgical and thermal coal demand is occurring while the western economies have not yet fully rebounded 
moving forward  it is unclear how worldwide coal supply will keep pace with demand 

table of contents patriot operations as discussed more fully under item a 
risk factors  our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by price volatility and demand  unforeseen adverse geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations  changes in general economic conditions  changes in the interpretation  enforcement or application of existing and potential coal mining laws and regulations  availability and the costs of competing energy resources  the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine  increase our mining costs  or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation  existing or new environmental laws and regulations  including selenium related matters  and the interpretation or enforcement thereof  negotiation of labor contracts  labor availability and relations  the outcome of pending or future litigation  changes in the costs to provide healthcare to eligible active employees and certain retirees under postretirement benefit obligations and contribution requirements to multi employer retiree healthcare and pension plans  reductions of purchases or deferral of deliveries by major customers  the availability and costs of credit  surety bonds and letters of credit  customer performance and credit risks  supplier and contract miner performance and the unavailability of transportation for coal shipments 
on a long term basis  our results of operations could also be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves  our ability to attract and retain skilled employees and contract miners  our ability to find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts  and fluctuating prices of key supplies  mining equipment and commodities 
additionally  our cost to provide healthcare to eligible active employees and certain retirees could increase due to the healthcare legislation 
potential legislation  regulation  treaties and accords at the local  state  federal and international level  and changes in the interpretation  enforcement or application of existing laws and regulations  have created uncertainty and could have a significant impact on demand for coal and our future operational and financial results 
for example  increased scrutiny of mining could make it difficult to receive permits or could otherwise cause production delays in the future 
the lack of proven technology to meet selenium discharge standards creates uncertainty as to the future costs of water treatment to comply with mining permits  which may be materially different from our current estimates 
additionally  future regulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions and coal combustion by products could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of our customers and significantly impact the demand for coal 
see item a 
risk factors for expanded discussion of these factors 
if upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize revenue increases  or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties  our operating margins would be negatively impacted 
management continues to focus on controlling costs  optimizing performance and responding quickly to market changes 
increased scrutiny by regulators has resulted in more comprehensive inspections which has caused decreased production and increased costs 
we expect this heightened regulatory oversight to continue 
we have developed detailed organic growth plans based on our extensive coal reserve base 
in response to what we believe will be sustained strength in the metallurgical coal market  we plan to increase our metallurgical coal production to million tons in  million tons in and more than million tons by we are planning to open a number of new metallurgical coal mines in the next two years 
while output from some of these mines will replace existing production from mines nearing the end of their reserves  the majority of this expansion amounts to incremental metallurgical volume 
we expect to begin production in and from organic projects at the rocklick  wells  kanawha eagle and logan county mining complexes 
annual production at each of these new mines is expected to be between  and  tons  resulting in a broad spectrum of coal qualities available from these expansions 
these expansions should be accomplished with a very reasonable capital outlay because they will be adding volume to existing preparation plant and loadout facilities 
we anticipate sales volume in the range of to million tons 
this includes metallurgical coal sales of to million tons  a significant increase over the million tons sold in as of december   our total unpriced planned production was to million tons

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
employee related liabilities we have significant long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations 
detailed information related to these liabilities is included in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
expense for the year ended december  for these liabilities totaled million  while payments were million 
postretirement benefits and certain components of our workers compensation obligations are actuarially determined  and we use various actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and future cost trends  to estimate the costs and obligations for these items 
the discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities 
we make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree healthcare and work related injuries and illness obligations 
our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates 
moreover  regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations 
our most significant employee liability is postretirement healthcare 
assumed discount rates and healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for postretirement healthcare plans 
below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts 
healthcare cost trend rate dollars in thousands effect on total service and interest cost components effect on gain loss amortization component effect on total postretirement benefit obligation discount rate dollars in thousands effect on total service and interest cost components effect on gain loss amortization component effect on total postretirement benefit obligation reclamation and remediation obligations our reclamation obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both underground and surface mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as defined by each mining permit 
reclamation obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including  among other items  estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data  estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage  the timing of these cash flows  and a credit adjusted  risk free rate 
as changes in estimates occur such as mine plan revisions  changes in estimated costs  or changes in timing of the reclamation activities  the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted  risk free rate 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated 
moreover  regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities 

table of contents our remediation obligations primarily consist of the estimated liability for water treatment in order to comply with selenium effluent limits included in certain mining permits 
this liability reflects the discounted estimated costs of the treatment systems to be installed and maintained with the goal of meeting the requirements of current court orders  consent decrees and mining permits 
this estimate was prepared considering the dynamics of current legislation  capabilities of currently available technology and our planned remediation strategy 
the exact amount of our assumed liability is uncertain due to the fact there is no proven technology to remediate our existing selenium discharges in excess of allowable limits to meet current permit standards 
if technology becomes available that meets permit standards or if the standards change in the future  our actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated 
reclamation and remediation obligation expense for the year ended december   was million  and payments totaled million

income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
in addition  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors  including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance  we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period this determination is made 
as of december  and  we maintained a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
uncertain tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns or expected to be taken on future tax returns are reflected in the measurement of current and deferred taxes 
the initial recognition process is a two step process with a recognition threshold step and a step to measure the benefit 
a tax benefit is recognized when it is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the merits of the position 
the second step is to measure the appropriate amount of the benefit to be recognized based on a best estimate measurement of the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december  and  the unrecognized tax benefits are immaterial  and if recognized would not currently affect our effective tax rate as any recognition would be offset with a valuation allowance 
we do not expect any significant increases or decreases to unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months of this reporting date 
additional detail regarding how we account for income taxes and the effect of income taxes on our consolidated financial statements is available in note revenue recognition in general  we recognize revenues when they are realizable and earned 
we generated substantially all of our revenues in from the sale of coal to our customers 
revenues from coal sales are realized and earned when risk of loss passes to the customer 
coal sales are made to our customers under the terms of coal supply agreements  most of which have a term of one year or more 
under the typical terms of these coal supply agreements  risk of loss transfers to the customer at the mine or port  where coal is loaded to the rail  barge  ocean going vessel  truck or other transportation source that delivers coal to its destination 
with respect to other revenues  other operating income  or gains on disposal or exchange of assets recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal  we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate 
we do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
derivatives we utilize derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to certain commodity prices 
we recognize derivative financial instruments at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets 
for derivatives that are not designated as hedges  the periodic change in fair value is recorded directly to earnings 
for derivative instruments that qualify and are designated by us as cash flow hedges  the periodic change in fair value is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss until the contract settles or the relationship ceases to qualify for hedge accounting 
in addition  if a portion of the change in fair value for a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective during a reporting period  the ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recorded directly to earnings 
we entered into heating oil swap contracts to manage our exposure to diesel fuel prices 
the changes in diesel fuel and heating oil prices are highly correlated  thus allowing the swap contracts to be designated as cash flow hedges 

table of contents share based compensation we have an equity incentive plan for employees and eligible non employee directors that allows for the issuance of share based compensation in the form of restricted stock  incentive stock options  nonqualified stock options  stock appreciation rights  performance awards  restricted stock units and deferred stock units 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and an applicable lattice pricing model to determine the fair value of certain market based performance awards 
determining the fair value of share based awards requires judgment  including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise  the associated volatility  and a risk free interest rate 
judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense could be materially impacted 
impairment of long lived assets impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations are recorded when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets under various assumptions are less than the carrying amounts of those assets 
impairment losses are measured by comparing the estimated fair value of the impaired asset to its carrying amount 
an impairment charge was recorded in related to equipment and coal reserves that were abandoned due to the closure of our harris no 
mine 
an impairment charge was recorded in related to certain infrastructure and thermal coal reserves near our rocklick complex that were deemed uneconomical to mine 
business combinations we account for business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
under this method of accounting  the purchase price is allocated to the fair value of the net assets acquired 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and the utilization of independent valuation experts  and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including  but not limited to  assumptions with respect to future cash flows  discount rates and asset lives 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers  sales of non core assets and financing transactions 
our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production  capital expenditures  interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations as well as acquisitions 
our ability to service our debt interest and principal and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses 
we expect to fund our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations or borrowed funds as necessary 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million compared to the prior year 
this decrease in net cash provided by operating activities resulted from an increase in the use of working capital of million  offset by improved operating results 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to cash used in investing activities of million in the prior year 
the increase in cash used reflected higher capital expenditures of million  additional advance mining royalties of million and a decrease in proceeds from the disposal or exchange of assets of million 
these increases in cash used were partially offset by higher cash proceeds of million from notes receivable related to the and sales of coal reserves and surface land 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to the prior year 
the increase in cash provided was primarily due to our debt offering  net of discount  of million in senior notes in may  as well as million from a coal reserve financing transaction in june and a decrease in short term debt payments of million 
these increases were partially offset by the decrease in proceeds from the equity offering of million  that occurred in june  and additional deferred financing costs in of million related to the may debt offering  the may credit facility restatement and amendment and the accounts receivable securitization program 
effective april  we entered into an agreement to sell coal mineral rights at our federal mining complex to a third party lessor and added them to an existing lease 
we recorded this transaction as a financing arrangement and accordingly recorded the million cash consideration as a liability  with million of the liability recorded in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses and million recorded in other noncurrent liabilities 
the liability is being accreted through interest expense over an expected lease term of approximately five years and will be relieved as we make future royalty payments 
additionally  as of december   we had million in notes receivable outstanding from a third party  arising out of the sale of coal reserves and surface land 
on february   the third party repaid these notes in full for million prior to their scheduled maturity date 

table of contents september  us district court ruling on september   the us district court for the southern district of west virginia the us district court found apogee in contempt for failing to comply with the march  consent decree 
apogee was ordered to install a fluidized bed reactor fbr water treatment facility for three outfalls and to come into compliance with applicable selenium discharge limits by march  additionally  the court ordered hobet to come into compliance with applicable discharge limits under the hobet surface mine no 
permit by may  apogee and hobet were required to jointly establish an irrevocable million letter of credit in support of the requirements of this ruling 
the court also appointed a special master who is authorized to monitor  supervise and direct apogee s and hobet s compliance with  and hear disputes that arise under  the september  order as well as other orders of the us district court 
pursuant to the september  ruling  we will record the costs to install the fbr water treatment facility for the three apogee outfalls as capital expenditures when incurred 
the capital expenditure for the facility is estimated to be approximately million 
in addition  the estimated future on going operating cash flows required to meet our legal obligation for remediation at the three apogee outfalls have changed from our original estimates based on the september  ruling 
as such  we increased the portion of the liability related to apogee by updating the fair value of the on going costs related to these three outfalls and recorded the million difference between this updated value and our previously recorded liability directly to income  through reclamation and remediation obligation expense in the third quarter of as required under the order  we submitted a schedule to develop a treatment plan for the outfall at hobet surface mine no 
to the us district court which includes conducting additional pilot projects related to certain technological alternatives 
a final treatment technology to be utilized at hobet surface mine no 
will be chosen in per the submitted schedule 
we will record an adjustment to the selenium environmental treatment liability  if necessary  if we modify our planned treatment technology or if we choose a different treatment technology for this outfall 
we are currently continuing to install zero valent iron zvi water treatment systems at other outfalls according to our original remediation strategy  while also performing a further review of other potential water treatment technology or other alternatives 
our remediation strategy reflects implementing scalable zvi systems at each outfall due to its modular design that can be reconfigured as further knowledge and certainty is gained 
initial zvi testing has identified potential system shortfalls  and to date zvi has not been demonstrated to perform consistently and sustainably in achieving effluent selenium limitations or in treating the expected flows at these outfalls 
however  based on the flexibility of the scalable system for configuration adjustments  we plan to continue to pursue the zvi treatment systems and determine whether modifications to the system could result in its ability to treat selenium successfully 
at this time  there is no plan to install fbr or any technology other than zvi at the other outfalls as neither fbr nor other technologies have been proven effective on a full scale basis 
however  we are continuing to research various treatment alternatives in addition to zvi for the other outfalls 
if zvi is not ultimately successful in treating the effluent selenium exceedances at these additional outfalls  we may be required to install alternative treatment technologies 
the cost of other technologies could be materially higher than the costs reflected in our liability 
furthermore  costs associated with potential modifications to zvi or the scale of the planned zvi systems to be installed could also cause the costs to be materially higher than the costs reflected in our liability 
while we are actively continuing to explore treatment options  there can be no assurance as to when a definitive solution will be identified and implemented 
as a result  actual costs may differ from our current estimates 
we will make additional adjustments to our liability when  and if  we have become subject to other obligations and or it becomes probable that we will utilize a different technology or modify the current technology  whether due to developments in our ongoing research or a legal obligation to do so 
credit facility effective october   we entered into a million  four year revolving credit facility  which included a million swingline sub facility and a letter of credit sub facility  subsequently amended for the magnum acquisition and the issuance of the convertible notes 
effective may   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement  which  among other things  extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility and adjusted borrowing capacity 
after the amendment and restatement  we have million available under the revolving credit facility with a maturity date of december  we incurred total fees of million in relation to the new agreement 
these fees as well as the fees related to the initial agreement are being amortized over the remaining term of the amended and restated agreement 
we wrote off million of the fees from the initial agreement due to changes to the syndication group 
this facility is available for our working capital requirements  capital expenditures and other corporate purposes 
as of december  and  the balance of outstanding letters of credit issued against the credit facility totaled million and million  respectively 
there were no outstanding short term borrowings against this facility as of december  and availability under the credit facility was million and million as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents the obligations under our credit facility are secured by a first lien on substantially all of our assets  including but not limited to certain of our mines  coal reserves and related fixtures 
the credit facility contains certain customary covenants  including financial covenants limiting our indebtedness related to net debt coverage and cash interest expense coverage  as well as certain limitations on  among other things  additional debt  liens  investments  acquisitions and capital expenditures  future dividends  and asset sales 
the credit facility calls for quarterly reporting of compliance with financial covenants 
on january   we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement which among other things modified certain limits and minimum requirements of our financial covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants of our amended credit facility 
the terms of the credit facility also contain certain customary events of default  which give the lenders the right to accelerate payments of outstanding debt in certain circumstances 
customary events of default include breach of covenants  failure to maintain required ratios  failure to make principal payments or to make interest or fee payments within a grace period  and default  beyond any applicable grace period  on any of our other indebtedness exceeding a certain amount 
accounts receivables securitization program in march  we entered into a million accounts receivable securitization program  which provides for the issuance of letters of credit and direct borrowings 
trade accounts receivable are sold  on a revolving basis  to a wholly owned bankruptcy remote entity facilitating entity  which then sells an undivided interest in all of the trade receivables to creditors as collateral for any borrowings 
available liquidity under the program fluctuates with the balance of our trade accounts receivable 
based on our continuing involvement with the trade accounts receivable balances  including continued risk of loss  the sale of the trade receivables to the creditors does not receive sale accounting treatment 
as such  the trade accounts receivable balances remain on our financial statements until settled 
any direct borrowings under the program will be recorded as secured debt 
the outstanding trade accounts receivable balance was million as of december  as of december   the balance of outstanding letters of credit issued against the accounts receivable securitization program totaled million and there were no direct borrowings under the program 
senior notes issuance on may   we completed a public offering of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the net proceeds of the offering were approximately million after deducting the initial million discount  purchasers commissions and fees  and expenses of the offering

the net proceeds of the offering were million after deducting the initial purchasers commissions and fees and expenses of the offering 
we adopted authoritative accounting guidance related to accounting for convertible debt effective january   with retrospective application to the issuance date of these convertible notes 
we utilized an interest rate of to reflect the nonconvertible market rate of our offering upon issuance  which resulted in a million discount to the convertible note balance and an increase to additional paid in capital to reflect the value of the conversion feature 
the nonconvertible market interest rate was based on an analysis of similar securities trading in the market at the pricing date of the issuance  taking into account company specific data such as credit spreads and implied volatility 
in addition  we allocated the financing costs related to the issuance of the convertible instruments between the debt and equity components 
the debt discount is amortized over the contractual life of the convertible notes  resulting in additional interest expense above the contractual coupon amount 
interest expense for the convertible notes was million  million and million for the year ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year 
the notes mature on may   unless converted  repurchased or redeemed in accordance with their terms prior to such date 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior debt and are senior to any subordinated debt 
we used the proceeds of the offering to repay magnum s existing senior secured indebtedness and acquisition related fees and expenses 
all remaining amounts were used for other general corporate purposes 
the notes are convertible into cash and  if applicable  shares of patriot s common stock during the period from issuance to february   subject to certain conditions of conversion as described below 
the conversion rate for the notes is shares of patriot s common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
the conversion rate and the conversion price are subject to adjustment for certain dilutive events  such as a future stock split or a distribution of a stock dividend 
the notes require us to settle all conversions by paying cash for the lesser of the principal amount or the conversion value of the notes  and by settling any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount in cash or shares  at our option 
holders of the notes may convert their notes prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding february   only under the following circumstances during the five trading day period after any ten consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the trading price per note for each trading day of that measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of patriot s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day  during any calendar quarter  and only during such calendar quarter  if the last reported sale price of patriot s common stock for or more trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds of the conversion price in effect on each such trading day  if such holder s notes have been called for redemption or upon the occurrence of corporate events specified in the indenture 
the notes will be convertible  regardless of the foregoing circumstances  at any time from  and including  february  until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date 
the number of shares of patriot s common stock that we may deliver upon conversion will depend on the price of our common stock during an observation period as described in the indenture 
specifically  the number of shares deliverable upon conversion will increase as the common stock price increases above the conversion price of per share during the observation period 
the maximum number of shares that we may deliver is  however  if certain fundamental changes occur in patriot s business that are deemed make whole fundamental changes in the indenture  the number of shares deliverable on conversion may increase  up to a maximum amount of  shares 
these maximum amounts are subject to adjustment for certain dilutive events  such as a stock split or a distribution of a stock dividend

off balance sheet arrangements and guarantees in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements 
these arrangements include guarantees  indemnifications  and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  and we do not expect any material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements

table of contents newly adopted accounting pronouncements transfers of financial assets in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding the accounting for transfers of financial assets  which requires enhanced disclosures about the continuing risk exposure to a transferor resulting from its continuing involvement with transferred financial assets 
we adopted this guidance effective january  see the description of our accounts receivables securitization program in liquidity and capital resources above 
consolidation in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance  which requires a company to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether it has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  including an assessment of the company s power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
we adopted this guidance effective january  upon adoption  we performed a qualitative assessment of our existing interests and determined that we held no interest in variable interest entities 
fair value disclosures in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires additional disclosures and clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we adopted this guidance effective january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the potential for changes in the market value of our coal portfolio is referred to as market risk 
due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term  illiquid nature of the positions  we have not quantified market risk related to our portfolio of coal supply agreements 
we manage our commodity price risk for our coal contracts through the use of long term coal supply agreements  rather than through the use of derivative instruments 
we sold of our sales volume under coal supply agreements with terms of one year or more during as of december  our total unpriced planned production for was approximately to million tons 
in connection with the spin off  we entered into long term coal contracts with marketing affiliates of peabody 
the arrangements  except as described below under credit risk  have substantially similar terms and conditions as the pre existing contractual obligations of peabody s marketing affiliate 
these arrangements may be amended or terminated only with the mutual agreement of peabody and patriot 
we have commodity risk related to our diesel fuel purchases 
to manage this risk  we have entered into swap contracts with financial institutions 
these derivative contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated diesel fuel purchases 
as of december   the notional amounts outstanding for these swaps included million gallons of heating oil expiring throughout as of february   the notional amounts outstanding for these swaps increased to million gallons of heating oil expiring throughout we expect to purchase approximately million gallons of diesel fuel annually 
excluding the impact of our hedging activities  a per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would impact our annual operating costs by approximately million 
credit risk approximately of our accounts receivable balance at december  was with a marketing affiliate of peabody  and we will continue to supply coal to peabody on a contract basis as described above  so peabody can meet its commitments under pre existing customer agreements sourced from our operations 
the pre existing customer arrangement between patriot and peabody with the longest term will expire on december  our remaining sales are made directly to electricity generators  industrial companies and steelmakers 
therefore  our concentration of credit risk is with peabody  as well as electricity generators and steelmakers 
our policy is to independently evaluate each customer s creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor the credit extended 
in the event that we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards  we will protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide appropriate credit enhancement 
when appropriate as determined by our credit management function  we have taken steps to mitigate our credit exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations 
these steps may include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral  requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay 
while the economic recession may affect our customers  we do not anticipate that it will significantly affect our overall credit risk profile due to our credit policies
