item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the sections of this report entitled risk factors  forward looking statements  and selected consolidated financial information of arbor realty trust  inc and subsidiaries and the historical consolidated financial statements of arbor realty trust  inc and subsidiaries  including related notes  included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a maryland corporation that was formed in june to invest in multi family and commercial real estate related bridge loans  junior participating interests in first mortgages  mezzanine loans  preferred and direct equity and  in limited cases  discounted mortgage notes and other real estate related assets  which we refer to collectively as structured finance investments 
we have also invested in mortgage related securities 
we conduct substantially all of our operations through our operating partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
our operating performance is primarily driven by the following factors net interest income earned on our investments net interest income represents the amount by which the interest income earned on our assets exceeds the interest expense incurred on our borrowings 
if the yield earned on our assets decreases or the cost of borrowings increases  this will have a negative impact on earnings 
however  if the yield earned on our assets increases or the cost of borrowings decreases  this will have a positive impact on earnings 
net interest income is also directly impacted by the size and performance of our asset portfolio 
see current market conditions  risks and recent trends below for risks and trends of our net interest income 
credit quality of our assets effective asset and portfolio management is essential to maximize the performance and value of a real estate mortgage investment 
maintaining the credit quality of our loans and investments is of critical importance 
loans that do not perform in accordance with their terms may have a negative impact on earnings and liquidity 
cost control we seek to minimize our operating costs  which consist primarily of employee compensation and related costs  management fees and other general and administrative expenses 
if there are increases in foreclosures and non performing loans and investments  certain of these expenses  particularly employee compensation expenses and asset management related expenses  may increase 
we are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit and to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code with respect thereto 
a reit is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of its reit taxable income which is distributed to its stockholders provided that at least of its reit taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met 
additionally  under the terms of our junior subordinated note agreements  annual dividends are limited to of taxable income to common shareholders and are required to be paid in the form of our stock to the maximum extent permissible currently  with the balance payable in cash 
certain reit income may be subject to state and local income taxes 
our assets or operations that would not otherwise comply with the reit requirements  are owned or conducted by our taxable reit subsidiaries  the income of which is subject to federal and state income tax 
under current federal tax law  the gain and the tax on the gain of certain debt extinguishment transactions realized in or may  at our election  be deferred to future periods 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of estimated state income taxes incurred in those states that do not adopt the federal tax law that allows us to elect to defer income generated from certain debt extinguishment transactions 
for the years ended 
table of contents december   and  we did not record a current provision for income taxes related to the assets that are held in taxable reit subsidiaries 
current market conditions  risks and recent trends global stock and credit markets have experienced prolonged price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions  which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen 
commercial real estate has been particularly adversely affected by this prolonged economic downturn and liquidity crisis 
if this continues  the commercial real estate sector will likely experience additional losses  challenges in complying with the terms of financing agreements  decreased net interest spreads  and additional difficulties in raising capital and obtaining investment financing with attractive terms or at all 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets and have resulted in the scarcity of certain types of financing  and  in certain cases  making terms for certain financings less attractive 
if these conditions persist  lending institutions may be forced to exit markets such as repurchase lending  become insolvent  further tighten their lending standards or increase the amount of equity capital required to obtain financing  and in such event  could make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all 
our profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain cost effective financing for our investments 
a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly 
in addition  these factors may make it more difficult for our borrowers to repay our loans as they may experience difficulties in selling assets  increased costs of financing or obtaining financing at all 
these events in the stock and credit markets may also make it more difficult or unlikely for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock 
these disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and other adverse effects on us or the economy in general 
this environment has had a significant impact on our business  our borrowers and real estate values throughout all asset classes and geographic locations 
continued declining real estate values may continue to limit our new mortgage loan originations  since borrowers often use increases in the value of their existing properties to support the purchase or investment in additional properties 
borrowers may also be less able to pay principal and interest on our loans if the real estate economy deteriorates further 
continued declining real estate values may also significantly increase the likelihood that we will continue to incur losses on our loans in the event of default because the value of our collateral may be insufficient to cover our cost on the loan 
any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies  foreclosures or losses could adversely affect both our net interest income from loans in our portfolio as well as our ability to originate  sell and securitize loans  which would significantly impact our revenues  results of operations  financial condition  business prospects and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
in addition  our investments are also subject to the risks described above with respect to commercial real estate loans and mortgage backed securities and similar risks  including risks of delinquency and foreclosure  the dependence upon the successful operation of  and net income from  real property  risks generally related to interests in real property  and risks that may be presented by the type and use of a particular commercial property 
during fiscal year  we recorded million of new provisions for loan losses  due to declining collateral values  million in cash recoveries related to three loans which were previously fully reserved  as well as million of recoveries related to two loans in which the underlying properties were sold and we provided financing to the new operators  and million of losses on restructured loans 
during fiscal year  we recorded million of new provisions for loan losses and million of losses on restructured loans 
during fiscal year  we recorded million of provisions for loan losses and no loss on restructured loans 
we have made  and continue to make modifications and extensions to loans when it is economically feasible to do so 
in some cases  modification is a more viable alternative to foreclosure 
table of contents proceedings when a borrower can not comply with loan terms 
in doing so  lower borrower interest rates  combined with non performing loans  will lower our net interest margins when comparing interest income to our costs of financing 
these trends may persist with a prolonged economic downturn and we feel if they do  there will be continued modifications and delinquencies in the foreseeable future  which will result in reduced net interest margins and additional losses throughout our sector 
commercial real estate financing companies have been severely impacted by the current economic environment and have had very little access to the capital markets or the debt markets in order to meet their existing obligations or to refinance maturing debt 
we have responded to these troubled times by decreasing investment activity for capital preservation  aggressively managing our assets through restructuring and extending our debt facilities and repurchasing our previously issued debt at discounts when economically feasible 
in order to accomplish these goals  we have worked closely with our borrowers in restructuring our loans  receiving payoffs and paydowns and monetizing our investments as appropriate 
additionally  based on available liquidity and market opportunities  we have from time to time repurchased our debt at discounts 
we also entered into an agreement with wachovia bank  national association  owned by wells fargo  national association wachovia to retire our then outstanding debt of million for million 
on june   we closed on our debt retirement agreement with wachovia and recorded a net gain on extinguishment of debt of million 
as part of this transaction  we had entered into a term credit facility for million at a different financial institution at june  which was subsequently repaid in october in february  we retired million of our junior subordinated notes in exchange for the re issuance of certain of our own collateralized debt obligation cdo bonds  as well as other assets 
during  we repurchased several of our own cdo bonds for gains and also sold a majority of our cdo bond and commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs investments for a net loss 
we will continue to remain focused on executing these strategies when appropriate and where available if this significant economic downturn persists 
refer to item a risk factors above and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below for additional risk factors 
sources of operating revenues we derive our operating revenues primarily from interest received from making real estate related bridge  mezzanine and junior participation loans and preferred equity investments 
interest income earned on these loans and investments represented approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
interest income may also be derived from profits on equity participation interests 
no such income was recognized in and in interest income from participation interests represented approximately of total revenues 
we also derive interest income from our investments in commercial real estate cdo bond securities and cmbs investments 
interest on these investments represented approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
property operating income is derived from our real estate owned assets 
in and  property operating income represented approximately and of our total revenue  respectively 
no such income was recognized in additionally  we derive operating revenues from other income that represents loan structuring and defeasance fees  and miscellaneous asset management fees associated with our loans and investments portfolio 
revenue from other income represented approximately of our total revenues in  and 
table of contents loss or income from equity affiliates and gain or loss on sale of loans and real estate we derive loss or income from equity affiliates relating to joint ventures that were formed with equity partners to acquire  develop and or sell real estate assets 
these joint ventures are not majority owned or controlled by us  and are not consolidated in our financial statements 
these investments are recorded under either the equity or cost method of accounting as appropriate 
we record our share of net income and losses from the underlying properties on equity method investments and any other than temporary impairment on these investments on a single line item in the consolidated statements of operations as loss or income from equity affiliates 
in  and  loss from equity affiliates totaled million  million and million  respectively 
we also may derive gains or losses from the sale of loans and real estate 
we may acquire real estate by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure related to our loans or for investment in order to stabilize the property and dispose of it for a future anticipated return 
we may also acquire real estate notes generally at a discount from lenders in situations where the borrower wishes to restructure and reposition its short term debt and the lender wishes to divest certain assets from its portfolio 
in  we sold a real estate held for sale property acquired by a foreclosure sale to a third party for net proceeds of approximately million and recorded a gain of million 
no such gain or loss was recorded in or significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification  the authoritative reference for accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
certain of the accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results of operations presented in the historical consolidated financial statements included in this report and require the application of significant judgment by management and  as a result  are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
loans  investments and securities at the time of purchase  we designate a security as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading depending on our ability and intent to hold it to maturity 
we do not have any securities designated as trading or held to maturity as of december  securities available for sale are reported at fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss  while securities and investments that are held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
unrealized losses that are determined to be other than temporary are recognized in earnings up to their credit component 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process requiring judgments and assumptions 
the process may include  but is not limited to  assessment of recent market events and prospects for near term recovery  assessment of cash flows  internal review of the underlying assets securing the investments  credit of the issuer and the rating of the security  as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity 
management closely monitors market conditions on which it bases such decisions 

table of contents we also assess certain of our securities  other than those of high credit quality  to determine whether significant changes in estimated cash flows or unrealized losses on these securities  if any  reflect a decline in value which is other than temporary and  accordingly  should be written down to their fair value against earnings 
on a quarterly basis  we review these changes in estimated cash flows  which could occur due to actual prepayment and credit loss experience  to determine if an other than temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process requiring judgments and assumptions and is not necessarily intended to indicate a permanent decline in value 
we calculate a revised yield based on the current amortized cost of the investment  including any other than temporary impairments recognized to date  and the revised yield is then applied prospectively to recognize interest income 
loans held for investment are intended to be held to maturity and  accordingly  are carried at cost  net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees  loan purchase discounts  and allowance for loan losses when such loan or investment is deemed to be impaired 
we invest in preferred equity interests that  in some cases  allow us to participate in a percentage of the underlying property cash flows from operations and proceeds from a sale or refinancing 
at the inception of each such investment  management must determine whether such investment should be accounted for as a loan  joint venture or as real estate 
to date  management has determined that all such investments are properly accounted for and reported as loans 
from time to time we may enter into an agreement to sell a loan 
these loans are considered held for sale and are valued at the lower of the loan carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
for the sale of loans  recognition occurs when ownership passes to the buyer 
impaired loans  allowance for loan losses and loss on restructured loans loans are considered impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due for both principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we evaluate each loan in our portfolio on a quarterly basis 
our loans are individually specific and unique as it relates to product type  geographic location  and collateral type  as well as to the rights and remedies and the position in the capital structure our loans and investments have in relation to the underlying collateral 
we evaluate all of this information as well as general market trends related to specific classes of assets  collateral type and geographic locations  when determining the appropriate assumptions such as capitalization and market discount rates  as well as the borrower operating income and cash flows  in estimating the value of the underlying collateral when determining if a loan is impaired 
included in the evaluation of the capitalization and market discount rates  we consider not only assumptions specific to collateral but also geographical and industry trends that could impact the collateral value 
if upon completion of the valuation  the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the impaired loan is less than the net carrying value of the loan  an allowance is created with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for each loan is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses 
we had a million allowance for loan losses at december  related to loans in our portfolio with an aggregate carrying value of approximately million  before loan loss reserves 
during the year ended december   we received million in cash recoveries related to three loans which were previously fully reserved 
in addition  we recorded million of recoveries related to two loans in which the underlying properties were sold and we provided financing to the new operators 
these recoveries were recorded in provision for loan losses on the statement of operations 
at december   we had a million allowance for loan losses related to loans in our portfolio with an aggregate carrying value of approximately million  before loan loss reserves 

table of contents loss on restructured loans are created when we grant a concession to a borrower in the form of principal forgiveness related to a payoff or the substitution or addition of a new debtor for the original borrower or when we incur costs on behalf of the borrower related to the modification  payoff or the substitution or addition of a new debtor for the original borrower 
when a loan is restructured  we record the investment at net realizable value  taking into account the cost of all concessions at the date of restructuring 
the reduction in the recorded investment is recorded as a charge to the statement of operations in the period in which the loan is restructured 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded loss on restructured loans of million and million  respectively 
no loss on restructured loans was recorded during the year ended december  real estate owned and held for sale real estate owned  shown net of accumulated depreciation  is comprised of real property acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure 
real estate acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure is recorded at the estimated fair value of the real estate at the time of foreclosure or delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
costs incurred in connection with the foreclosure of the properties collateralizing the real estate loans are expensed as incurred and costs subsequently incurred to extend the life or improve the assets subsequent to foreclosure are capitalized 
we allocate the purchase price of operating properties to land  building  tenant improvements  deferred lease cost for the origination costs of the in place leases  intangibles for the value of the above or below market leases at fair value and to any other identified intangible assets or liabilities 
we finalize the purchase price allocation on these assets within one year of the acquisition date 
we amortize the value allocated to the in place leases over the remaining lease term 
the value allocated to the above or below market leases are amortized over the remaining lease term as an adjustment to rental income 
real estate assets  including assets acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure that are operated for the production of income are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
ordinary repairs and maintenance which are not reimbursed by the tenants are expensed as incurred 
major replacements and betterments which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life 
our properties are individually reviewed for impairment each quarter  if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
we recognize impairment if the undiscounted estimated cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
measurement of impairment is based upon the estimated fair value of the assets 
upon evaluating a property  many factors are considered  including estimated current and expected operating cash flow from the property during the projected holding period  costs necessary to extend the life or improve the asset  expected capitalization rates  projected stabilized net operating income  selling costs  and the ability to hold and dispose of such real estate owned in the ordinary course of business 
valuation adjustments may be necessary in the event that effective interest rates  rent up periods  future economic conditions  and other relevant factors vary significantly from those assumed in valuing the property 
if future evaluations result in a diminution in the value of the property  the reduction will be recognized as an impairment charge at that time 
real estate is classified as held for sale when management commits to a plan of sale  the asset is available for immediate sale  there is an active program to locate a buyer  and it is probable the sale will be complete within one year 
properties classified as held for sale are not depreciated and the results of their operations are shown in discontinued operations 
real estate assets that are expected to be disposed of are valued  on an individual asset basis  at the lower of the carrying amount or their fair value less costs to sell 

table of contents we recognize sales of real estate properties upon closing 
payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits 
profit on real estate sold is recognized upon closing using the full accrual method when the collectability of the sale price is reasonably assured and we are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale 
profit may be deferred in whole or in part until collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured and the earnings process is complete 
revenue recognition interest income 
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis as it is earned from loans  investments and securities 
in certain instances  the borrower pays an additional amount of interest at the time the loan is closed  an origination fee  and or deferred interest upon maturity 
in some cases  interest income may also include the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts arising from the purchase or origination of the loan or security 
this additional income  net of any direct loan origination costs incurred  is deferred and accreted into interest income on an effective yield or interest method adjusted for actual prepayment activity over the life of the related loan or security as a yield adjustment 
income recognition is suspended for loans when  in the opinion of management a full recovery of all contractual principal is not probable 
income recognition is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is resumed 
we do record interest income on certain impaired loans  in which a loan loss reserve has been recorded  as the borrower continue to make interest payments 
we recorded loan loss reserves related to these loans as it was deemed that full recovery of principal is not probable 
several of the loans provide for accrual of interest at specified rates  which differ from current payment terms 
interest is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management determination that accrued interest and outstanding principal are ultimately collectible  based on the underlying collateral and operations of the borrower 
if management cannot make this determination  interest income above the current pay rate is recognized only upon actual receipt 
during the fourth quarter of we suspended the recording of the accrual rate of interest on loans collateralized by a development project  and as a result  at december  we had no such loans in our portfolio that were currently accruing such interest 
therefore  interest income is recorded on all of our loans and investments only to the extent that the current pay rate is received 
additionally  interest income is recorded when earned from equity participation interests  referred to as equity kickers 
these equity kickers have the potential to generate additional revenues to us as a result of excess cash flow distributions and or as appreciated properties are sold or refinanced 
we did not record interest income on such investments for the year ended december  or  as compared to million of interest on such loans and investments for the year ended december  property operating income 
property operating income represents income associated with the operation of commercial real estate properties recorded as real estate owned 
we recognize revenue for these activities when the fees are fixed or determinable  or evidenced by an arrangement  collection is reasonably assured and the services under the arrangement have been provided 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded approximately million and million  respectively  of property operating income relating to real estate owned 
as of december   we had two real estate owned properties and at december  we had one real estate owned property 
this was due to a real estate investment that was acquired by deed in lieu of foreclosure in april and a real estate investment reclassified from real estate owned to real estate held for sale at september  which resulted in a reclassification from property operating income into discontinued operations for the current and all prior periods and was subsequently sold in october  another real estate investment was reclassified from real estate owned to real estate held for sale at september  which resulted in the reclassification of all of the revenues from these properties from property operating income into discontinued operations for the current and all prior periods 
we did not have property operating income in due to the subsequent reclassification of an asset to discontinued

stock based compensation we have granted certain of our employees  independent directors  and employees of acm  restricted stock awards consisting of shares of our common stock that vest annually over a multi year period  subject to the recipient continued service to us 
we record stock based compensation expense at the grant date fair value of the related stock based award with subsequent remeasurement for any unvested shares granted to non employees 
such amounts are expensed against earnings  at the grant date for the portion that vests immediately or ratably over the respective vesting periods 
dividends are paid on the restricted shares as dividends are paid on shares of our common stock whether or not they are vested 
stock based compensation is disclosed in our consolidated statement of operations under employee compensation and benefits for employees and under selling and administrative expense for non employees 
income taxes we are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a reit and to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code with respect thereto 
a reit is generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income which is distributed to its stockholders  provided that at least of taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met 
certain reit income may be subject to state and local income taxes 
our assets or operations that would not otherwise comply with the reit requirements  are owned or conducted by our taxable reit subsidiaries  the income of which is subject to federal and state income tax 
under current federal tax law  the income and the tax on such income  if any  attributable to certain debt extinguishment transactions realized in or may  at our election  be deferred to future periods 
current accounting guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements 
this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this guidance also provides clarity on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure 
variable interest entities we have evaluated our loans and investments  mortgage related securities  investments in equity affiliates  junior subordinated notes and cdos  in order to determine if they qualify as vies or as variable interests in vies 
this evaluation resulted in our determination that our bridge loans  junior participation loans  mezzanine loans  preferred equity investments  investments in equity affiliates  junior subordinated notes  cdos  and investments in debt securities were potential vies or variable interests in vies 
a vie is defined as an entity in which equity investors i do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest  and or ii do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties 
a vie is required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary  which is defined as the party that i has the power to control the activities that impact the vie economic performance and ii has the right to receive the majority of expected returns or the obligation to absorb the majority of expected losses 
we consolidate our three cdo subsidiaries  which qualify as vies  of which we are the primary beneficiary 
these cdos invest in real estate and real estate related securities and are financed by the issuance of cdo debt securities 
we  or one our affiliates  is named collateral manager  servicer  and special servicer for all cdo collateral assets which we believes gives us the power to direct the most significant economic activities of the entity 
we also have exposure to cdo losses to the extent of our 
table of contents equity interests and also have rights to waterfall payments in excess of required payments to cdo bond investors 
as a result of consolidation  equity interests in these cdos have been eliminated  and the consolidated balance sheet reflects both the assets held and debt issued by the cdos to third parties 
our operating results and cash flows include the gross amounts related to cdo assets and liabilities as opposed to our net economic interests in the cdo entities 
as of december   we have identified loans and investments which were made to entities determined to be vies with an aggregate carrying amount of million 
these vie entities had exposure to real estate debt of approximately billion at december  for the vies identified  we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiaries and as such the vies should not be consolidated in our financial statements 
for all other investments  we have determined they are not vies or variable interests in vies 
as such  we have continued to account for these loans and investments as a loan or joint venture  as appropriate 
a summary of our identified vies or variable interests in vies is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
derivatives and hedging activities the carrying values of interest rate swaps and the underlying hedged liabilities are reflected at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are either offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged liability through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
derivatives that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment are adjusted to fair value through earnings 
we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
additionally  the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative  whether a company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  such as interest rate risk  are considered fair value hedges 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge 
we may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risks  even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting 
during the year ended december   we entered into two new interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges with a combined notional value of approximately million and one libor cap with a notional value of approximately million that does not qualify as a cash flow hedge 
in addition  the notional values on one basis swap and two interest rate swaps had net amortization of approximately million and six interest rate swaps matured with a combined notional of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we entered into one new interest rate swap that qualifies as a cash flow hedge with a notional value of approximately million and paid million  which will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the swap of approximately six years  and we terminated seven interest rate swaps related to our restructured trust preferred securities  with a combined notional value of million  for a loss of million recorded to loss on termination of swaps on our consolidated statement of operations 
refer to the section titled liquidity and capital resources junior subordinated notes below 
during the year ended december   we also terminated an interest rate swap with a notional 
table of contents value of approximately million and a million portion of an interest rate swap with a total notional value of approximately million 
additionally  one basis swap with a notional amount of million matured and the notional values of one basis swap and one interest rate swap were amortized down by approximately million 
the remaining losses on termination will be amortized to interest expense over the original life of the hedging instruments 
the fair value of our qualifying hedge portfolio has decreased by approximately million from december  as a result of the terminated and matured swaps  combined with a change in the projected libor rates and credit spreads of both parties 
because the valuations of our hedging activities are based on estimates  the fair value may change if our estimates are inaccurate 
for the effect of hypothetical changes in market interest rates on our interest rate swaps  see interest rate risk in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  set forth in item a hereof 
fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable  willing parties 
a liability fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor  not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor 
where available  fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters 
where observable prices or inputs are not available  valuation models are applied 
these valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment  the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity 
assets and liabilities disclosed at fair value are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value 
hierarchical levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities  are as follows level inputs are unadjusted and quoted prices exist in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date 
the types of assets and liabilities carried at level fair value generally are government and agency securities  equities listed in active markets  investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and listed derivatives 
level inputs other than quoted prices included in level are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument anticipated life 
level inputs include quoted market prices in markets that are not active for an identical or similar asset or liability  and quoted market prices in active markets for a similar asset or liability 
fair valued assets and liabilities that are generally included in this category are non government securities  municipal bonds  certain hybrid financial instruments  certain mortgage and asset backed securities  certain corporate debt  certain commitments and guarantees  certain private equity investments and certain derivatives 
level inputs reflect management best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
these valuations are based on significant unobservable inputs that require a considerable amount of judgment and assumptions 
consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model 
generally  assets and liabilities carried at fair value and included in this category are certain mortgage and asset backed securities  certain corporate debt  certain private equity investments  certain municipal bonds  certain commitments and guarantees and certain derivatives 

table of contents determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment and we evaluate our hierarchy disclosures each quarter 
at december   we measured certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis  including available for sale securities and derivative financial instruments 
fair values of our derivative financial instruments are approximated on current market data received from financial sources that trade such instruments and are based on prevailing market data and derived from third party proprietary models based on well recognized financial principles and reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions 
these items are included in other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
we incorporate credit valuation adjustments in the fair values of our derivative financial instruments to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk 
in addition  the fair value of our available for sale securities are approximated on current market quotes received from financial sources that trade such securities 
the fair values of certain cmbs securities that are impaired are estimated by us using level inputs that require significant judgments  which include assumptions regarding capitalization rates  leasing  creditworthiness of major tenants  occupancy rates  availability of financing  exit plan  loan sponsorship  actions of other lenders and other factors deemed necessary by management 
at december   we measured certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  including loans 
loans held for investment are intended to be held to maturity and  accordingly  are carried at cost  net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees  loan purchase discounts  and net of the allowance for loan losses when such loan or investment is deemed to be impaired 
we consider a loan impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due for both principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement

provision for income taxes we are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
as a reit  we are generally not subject to federal income tax on our reit taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders  provided that we distribute at least of our reit taxable income and meet certain other requirements 
as of december  and  we were in compliance with all reit requirements and  therefore  have not provided for income tax expense on our reit taxable income for the years ended december  and certain of our assets that produce non qualifying income are owned by our taxable reit subsidiaries  the income of which is subject to federal and state income taxes 
during the years ended december  and  we did not record any provision on income from these taxable reit subsidiaries

table of contents million for the year ended december   was reclassified to discontinued operations 
during the third quarter of  we mutually agreed with a first mortgage lender to appoint a receiver to operate another of our real estate owned investments 
as a result  this investment was reclassified from real estate owned to real estate held for sale at a fair value of million and property operating income and expenses  which netted to a loss of million and million in and  respectively  were reclassified to discontinued operations  and an impairment loss of million was recorded to write down the investment to its fair value was recorded in the third quarter of also in the third quarter of  we stopped recording interest expense related to the note payable for the real estate investment  as the interest expense is non recourse and we are in the process of cooperating with the receiver and the first lien holder in order for the first lien holder to take title to the office building subject to the million first mortgage 
the receiver issued financial statements indicated that the real estate investment has been operating at a profit since the receiver assumed control of the property operations 
we believe these amounts are not realizable at this time and  as such  did not record any of this net income 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof for further details 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interest net income attributable to noncontrolling interest totaled million in representing the portion of income allocated to the third party interest in a consolidated subsidiary  primarily the result of the million gain recorded from the exchange of our profits interest in pom during the first quarter of allocated to the third party interest in a consolidated subsidiary 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interest totaled million in and represented the portion of our income allocated to our manager for its noncontrolling interest in our operating partnership as well as loss allocated to a third party interest in a consolidated subsidiary 
there was no net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in our operating partnership in our manager had a weighted average limited partnership interest of for the six months ended june  in june  our manager  exercised its right to redeem its  operating partnership units in our operating partnership for shares of our common stock on a one for one basis 
as a result  our manager operating partnership ownership interest percentage was reduced to 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity liquidity is a measurement of the ability to meet potential cash requirements 
our short term and long term liquidity needs include ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund future loans and investments  fund additional cash collateral from potential declines in the value of a portion of our interest rate swaps  fund operating costs and distributions to our stockholders as well as other general business needs 
our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of proceeds from equity offerings  debt facilities and cash flows from our operations 
our equity sources consist of funds raised from our private equity offering in july  net proceeds from our initial public offering of our common stock in april  net proceeds from our public offering of our common stock in june and depending on market conditions  proceeds from capital market transactions including the future issuance of common  convertible and or preferred equity securities 
our debt facilities include the issuance of floating rate notes resulting from our cdos  the issuance of junior subordinated notes and borrowings under a credit agreement 
net cash flows include interest income from our loan and investment portfolio reduced by interest expense on our debt facilities  cash from equity participation interests  repayments of outstanding loans and investments and funds from junior loan participation arrangements 

table of contents we believe our existing sources of funds will be adequate for purposes of meeting our short term and long term liquidity needs 
our loans and investments are financed under existing credit facilities and their credit status is continuously monitored  therefore  these loans and investments are expected to generate a generally stable return 
our ability to meet our long term liquidity and capital resource requirements is subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing 
any decision by our lenders and investors to enter into such transactions with us will depend upon a number of factors  such as our financial performance  compliance with the terms of our existing credit arrangements  industry or market trends  the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions  such lenders and investors resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make such capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
current conditions in the capital and credit markets have made certain forms of financing less attractive and  in certain cases  less available 
therefore  we will continue to rely on cash flows provided by operating and investing activities for working capital 
to maintain our status as a reit under the internal revenue code  we must distribute annually at least of our reit taxable income 
these distribution requirements limit our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations 
however  we believe that our capital resources and access to financing will provide us with financial flexibility and market responsiveness at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated capital requirements 
under recently issued irs guidance  a listed reit may offer shareholders elective stock dividends  which are paid in a combination of cash and common stock with at least of the total distribution paid in cash  to satisfy future dividend requirements 
cash flows as of december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
the following table shows our cash flow components in thousands twelve months ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period cash and cash equivalents at end of period our cash flows from operating activities decreased by million  or  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the comparable period in primarily due to a million decrease in cash posted against our swaps  a million decrease in net interest income  and a million decrease in distributions from operations of equity affiliates 
cash flows from investing activities increased by million  or  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the comparable period in primarily due to the million in proceeds received from the sale of available for sale securities and a million increase in payoffs and paydowns of loans and investments  net of a million increase in loans and investments funded  originated and purchased  net

in june  we sold  shares of our common stock in a public offering at a price of per share  for net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discount and the other estimated offering expenses 
we used the proceeds to pay down debt and finance our loan and investment portfolio 
in august  we entered into an equity placement program sales agreement with a securities agent whereby we may issue and sell up to three million shares of our common stock through the agent who agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell such shares during the term of the agreement and under the terms set forth therein 
to date  we have not utilized this equity placement program

at december   we had  common shares outstanding 
debt facilities we also currently maintain liquidity through a master repurchase agreement  a note payable and a junior loan participation with three different financial institutions or companies 
in addition  we have issued three collateralized debt obligations or cdos and nine separate junior subordinated notes

table of contents these debt facilities are described in further detail in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
repurchase agreements repurchase obligation financings provide us with a revolving component to our debt structure 
repurchase agreements provide stand alone financing for certain assets and interim  or warehouse financing  for assets that we plan to contribute to our cdos 
we have one repurchase agreement with a financial institution that bears interest at basis points over libor and has a term expiring in june this facility does not have financial covenants and has a committed amount of million reflecting the one asset currently financed 
at december   the outstanding balance under this facility was million with a current weighted average note rate of 
we had an uncommitted master repurchase agreement with a second financial institution  effective april  entered into for the purpose of financing a portion of our cre cdo bond securities 
the agreement had a term expiring in may and bore interest at pricing over libor  varying on the type of asset financed 
in january  the facility was repaid in full 
cdos we completed the formation of three separate cdo entities since by issuing to third party investors  tranches of investment grade collateralized debt obligations through newly formed wholly owned subsidiaries the issuers 
the issuers hold assets  consisting primarily of real estate related assets and cash which serve as collateral for the cdos 
the assets pledged as collateral for the cdos were contributed from our existing portfolio of assets 
by contributing these real estate assets to the various cdos  these transactions resulted in a decreased cost of funds relating to the corresponding cdo assets and created capacity in our existing credit facilities 
the issuers issued tranches of investment grade floating rate notes of approximately million  million and million for cdo i  cdo ii and cdo iii  respectively 
cdo iii also has a million revolving note which was not drawn upon at the time of issuance 
the revolving note facility has a commitment fee of per annum on the undrawn portion of the facility 
the tranches were issued with floating rate coupons based on three month libor plus pricing of 
proceeds from the sale of the investment grade tranches issued in cdo i  cdo ii and cdo iii of million  million and million  respectively  were used to repay higher costing outstanding debt under our repurchase agreements and notes payable 
the cdos may be replenished with substitute collateral for loans that are repaid during the first four years for cdo i and the first five years for cdo ii and cdo iii  subject to certain customary provisions 
thereafter  the outstanding debt balance will be reduced as loans are repaid 
proceeds from the repayment of assets which serve as collateral for the cdos must be retained in its structure as restricted cash until such collateral can be replaced and therefore are not available to fund current cash needs 
if such cash is not used to replenish collateral  it could have a negative impact on our anticipated returns 
cdo ii makes quarterly amortization payments of million to investors as a reduction of the cdo liability 
as of april   cdo i reached the end of its replenishment date and will no longer make quarterly amortization payments of million to investors 
investor capital will be repaid quarterly from proceeds received from loan repayments held as collateral in accordance with the terms of the cdo 
proceeds distributed will be recorded as a reduction of the cdo liability 
our cdo vehicles are vies for which we are the primary beneficiary and are consolidated in our financial statements 
during the year ended december   we purchased  at a discount  approximately million of investment grade rated notes originally issued by our cdo i issuing entity for a price of million  million of investment grade rated notes originally issued by our cdo ii issuing 
table of contents entity for a price of million and million originally issued by our cdo iii issuing entity for a price of million from third party investors

during the year ended december   we purchased  at a discount  approximately million of investment grade rated notes originally issued by our cdo issuing entities for a price of million and recorded a net gain on extinguishment of debt of million in our consolidated statement of operations 
in february  we re issued the cdo bonds we had acquired throughout with an aggregate face amount of million  as well as cdo bonds from other issuers acquired in the second quarter of with an aggregate face amount of million and a carrying value of million  and million in cash  in exchange for the retirement of million of our junior subordinated notes 
this transaction resulted in the recording of million of additional cdo debt  of which million represents the portion of our cdo bonds that were exchanged and million represents the estimated interest due on the reissued bonds through their maturity 
see liquidity and capital resources junior subordinated notes below 
at december   the outstanding note balance under cdo i  cdo ii and cdo iii was million  million and million  respectively 
the continued turmoil in the structured finance markets has negatively impacted the credit markets generally  and  as a result  investor demand for commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations has been substantially curtailed 
in recent years  we have relied to a substantial extent on cdo financings to obtain match funded financing for our investments 
until the market for commercial real estate cdos recovers  we may be unable to utilize cdos to finance our future investments and we may need to utilize less favorable sources of financing or our working capital to finance our investments on a long term basis 
there can be no assurance as to when demand for commercial real estate cdos will return  the terms of such securities investors will demand or whether we will be able to issue cdos to finance our investments on terms beneficial to us 
our cdo bonds contain interest coverage and asset over collateralization covenants that must be met as of the waterfall distribution date in order for us to receive such payments 
if we fail these covenants in any of our cdos  all cash flows from the applicable cdo would be diverted to repay principal and interest on the outstanding cdo bonds and we would not receive any residual payments until that cdo regained compliance with such tests 
our cdos were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  as well as on the most recent determination date 
in the event of a breach of the cdo covenants that could not be cured in the near term  we would be required to fund our non cdo expenses  including management fees and employee costs  distributions required to maintain reit status  debt costs  and other expenses with i cash on hand  ii income from any cdo not in breach of a covenant test  iii income from real property and loan assets  iv sale of assets  v or accessing the equity or debt capital markets  if available 
we have the right to cure covenant breaches which would resume normal residual payments to us by purchasing non performing loans out of the cdos 
however  we may not have sufficient liquidity available to do so at such time 

table of contents the chart below is a summary of our cdo compliance tests as of the most recent distribution date cash flow triggers cdo i cdo ii cdo iii overcollateralization current limit pass fail pass pass pass interest coverage current limit pass fail pass pass pass the overcollateralization ratio divides the total principal balance of all collateral in the cdo by the total bonds associated with the applicable ratio 
to the extent an asset is considered a defaulted security  the asset principal balance is multiplied by the lower of the market rate or the asset recovery rate which is determined by the rating agencies 
the interest coverage ratio divides interest income by interest expense for the classes senior to those retained by us 
junior subordinated notes in february  we retired million of our junior subordinated notes  with a carrying value of million in exchange for the re issuance of our own cdo bonds we had acquired throughout with an aggregate face amount of million  cdo bonds from other issuers acquired in the second quarter of with an aggregate face amount of million and a carrying value of million  and million in cash

cash flow from operations we continually monitor our cash position to determine the best use of funds to both maximize our return on funds and maintain an appropriate level of liquidity 
historically  in order to maximize the return on our funds  cash generated from operations has generally been used to temporarily pay down borrowings under credit facilities whose primary purpose is to fund our new loans and investments 
consequently  when making distributions in the past  we have borrowed the required funds by drawing on credit capacity available under our credit facilities

management agreement we  arlp and arbor realty sr  inc have a management agreement with acm  pursuant to which acm provides certain services and we pay acm a base management fee and under certain circumstances  an annual incentive fee 
on august   we amended our management agreement with our manager  acm  effective as of january  the amendment was negotiated by a special committee of our board of directors  consisting solely of independent directors and was approved unanimously by all of the independent directors 
the previous base management fee structure  which was calculated as a percentage of our equity  was replaced with an arrangement whereby we now reimburse acm for its actual costs incurred in managing our business based on the parties agreement in advance on an annual budget with subsequent quarterly true ups to actual costs 
this change was adopted retroactively to january  and the base management fee was million 
the base management fee was million and the base management fee is estimated to be approximately million  which was approved by the special committee of our board of directors 
as part of the amendment to the management agreement  all origination fees on investments are now retained by us  whereas under the prior agreement  origination fees up to of the principal amount of the loan were retained by acm 
the incentive fee is calculated as of the amount by which a our funds from operations per share  adjusted for certain gains and losses including gains from the retirement and restructuring of debt and of any loan loss reserve recoveries spread over a three year period  exceeds b the product of x per annum or the ten year us treasury rate plus  whichever is greater  and y the greater of or the weighted average of book value of the net assets contributed by acm to arlp per arlp partnership unit  the offering price per share of our common equity in the private offering on july  and subsequent offerings and the issue price per arlp partnership unit for subsequent contributions to arlp  multiplied by the weighted average of our outstanding shares 
the minimum return  or incentive fee hurdle  to be reached before an incentive fee is earned  is a percentage applied on a per share basis to the greater of or the average gross proceeds per share  whereas the previous management agreement provided for such percentage hurdle to be applied solely to the average gross proceeds per share 
in addition  of any loan loss and other reserve recoveries are eligible to be included in the incentive fee calculation  which recoveries are spread over a three year period  whereas the previous management agreement did not limit the inclusion of such recoveries in the incentive fee calculation

however  when applicable  we pay the annual incentive fee in four installments  each within days of the end of each fiscal quarter 
the calculation of each installment is based on results for the twelve months ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter for which the installment is payable 
these installments of the annual incentive fee are subject to recalculation and potential reconciliation at the end of such fiscal year  and any overpayments are required to be repaid in accordance with the amended management agreement 
subject to the ownership limitations in our charter  at least of this incentive fee is payable to our manager in shares of our common stock having a value equal to the average closing price per share for the last days of the fiscal quarter for which the incentive fee is being paid 
for the twelve month period ending december   acm earned an incentive management fee of million  which was included in due to related party as of december  as provided for in the management agreement  we offset the balance of a prepaid management fee receivable of million as of december   and acm elected to be paid the remaining incentive management fee in  shares of our common stock and million in cash  which will be subsequently remitted in in and  acm did not earn an incentive management fee 
as more fully described in liquidity and capital resources notes payable above  on june   we closed on the discounted payoff agreement with wachovia and retired all of its debt with wachovia at the discount described 
the successful completion of the retirement of the wachovia debt was a significant contributor to an incentive fee for the manager in as indicated earlier  gains on the extinguishment of debt are included in the incentive fee calculation and the gain  net of fees  certain expenses  and taxes  attributable to the wachovia transaction was million 
for further information on the impact of the retirement of the wachovia debt and any associated incentive fee earned as a result thereby  see retirement of wachovia debt below 
additionally  in  acm received an incentive fee installment totaling million which was recorded as prepaid management fees related to the incentive fee on million of deferred revenue recognized on the transfer of control of the west rd street property  one of our equity affiliates 
the incentive fee is accrued as it is earned 
the expense incurred for the incentive fee paid in common stock is determined using the valuation method described above and the quoted market price of our common stock on the last day of each quarter 
at december of each year  we remeasure the incentive fee paid to acm in the form of common stock in accordance with current accounting guidance  which discusses how to measure at the measurement date when certain terms are not known prior to the measurement date 
accordingly  the expense recorded for such common stock is adjusted to reflect the fair value of the common stock on the measurement date when the final calculation of the total incentive fee is determined 
in the event that the incentive fee for the full year is an amount less than the total of the installment payments made to acm for the year  acm will refund the amount of such overpayment to us in cash regardless of whether such installments were paid in cash or common stock 
in such a case  we would record a negative incentive fee expense in the quarter when such overpayment is determined 
inflation changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the economy in response to changes in the rate of inflation generally have little effect on our income because the majority of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have floating rates of interest 
however  the significant 
table of contents decline in interest rates triggered libor floors on certain of our variable rate interest earning assets 
this resulted in an increase in interest rate spreads on certain assets as the rates we pay on variable rate interest bearing liabilities declined at a greater pace than the rates we earned on our variable rate interest earning assets 
the number of loans impacted by libor floors have significantly decreased over this time as a majority of the loans with such floors were paid off  monetized  modified or restructured 
additionally  we have various fixed rate loans in our portfolio which are financed with variable rate libor borrowings 
in connection with these loans  we have entered into various interest swaps to hedge our exposure to the interest rate risk on our variable rate libor borrowings as it relates to certain fixed rate loans in our portfolio 
however  the value of our interest earning assets  our ability to realize gains from the sale of assets  and the average life of our interest earning assets  among other things  may be affected

retirement of wachovia debt on june  we closed on the discounted payoff agreement with wachovia and recorded a million gain  net of fees  certain expenses  and taxes  to our consolidated statement of 
table of contents operations 
the wachovia transaction has had a material impact on our results of operations in  and the following is intended to discuss this impact 
the reported gain on the wachovia transaction of million  or approximately per share  is the result of the successful execution of a unique opportunity negotiated by us with our principal lender in late and early the circumstances in the commercial real estate finance market that presented us with this opportunity are not anticipated to occur again and  while we intend to continue to look for opportunities to repurchase our debt at attractive discounts  thereby creating additional gains for our shareholders  it is not anticipated that future gains on the retirement or repurchase of our debt  if any  will be comparable in size to that of the gain generated from the wachovia transaction 
while the gain on the wachovia transaction results in taxable income to us and our shareholders  under current federal tax law and regulations  the income and the tax on the income  if any  may  at our election  be deferred to future periods 
we do not anticipate finalizing the tax treatment of the income associated with the wachovia transaction until the filing of our tax return in as previously reported  we were able to retire the entire wachovia debt principally through the use of our liquidity  effective use of our debt facilities and a new million term loan facility  which was repaid in october as a result  completion of the wachovia transaction had a material impact on our liquidity  reducing our cash and cash equivalents from approximately million at march  to approximately million at june  however  the retirement of the wachovia debt significantly reduced our interest costs as a result of the reduced level of debt and we have a significant amount of unencumbered assets  net of reserves  each of which had a positive impact on our liquidity through the balance of as of december   we have approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
as discussed in management agreement above  the million gain resulting from the completion of the retirement of the wachovia debt is a component in the calculation of the incentive fee payable under the terms of the management agreement between us and acm  our manager 
as indicated in management agreement above  an incentive fee is earned for a full fiscal year if our funds from operations  as adjusted for certain gains and losses on transactions including those similar in nature to the wachovia transaction  exceeds the incentive fee hurdle 
in that event  the manager receives an incentive fee equal to of the amount by which funds from operations  as adjusted  exceeds the hurdle 
for the twelve month period ending december   acm earned an incentive management fee of million  which was included in due to related party as of december  as provided for in the management agreement  we offset the balance of a prepaid management fee receivable of million as of december   and acm elected to be paid the remaining incentive management fee in  shares of our common stock and million in cash  which will be subsequently remitted in see management agreement and related party transactions above

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and real estate values 
the primary market risks that we are exposed to are real estate risk and interest rate risk 
market conditions we are subject to market changes in the debt and secondary mortgage markets 
these markets are currently experiencing disruptions  which could have an adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition 
current conditions in the debt markets include reduced liquidity and increased risk adjusted premiums 
these conditions may increase the cost and reduce the availability of debt 
we attempt to mitigate the impact of debt market disruptions by obtaining adequate debt facilities from a variety of financing sources 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful in these efforts  that such debt facilities will be adequate or that the cost of such debt facilities will be at similar terms 
the secondary mortgage markets are also currently experiencing disruptions resulting from reduced investor demand for collateralized debt obligations and increased investor yield requirements for these obligations 
in light of these conditions  we currently expect to finance our loan and investment portfolio with our current capital and debt facilities 
real estate risk commercial mortgage assets may be viewed as exposing an investor to greater risk of loss than residential mortgage assets since such assets are typically secured by larger loans to fewer obligors than residential mortgage assets 
multi family and commercial property values and net operating income derived from such properties are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  events such as natural disasters including hurricanes and earthquakes  acts of war and or terrorism such as the events of september  and others that may cause unanticipated and uninsured performance declines and or losses to us or the owners and operators of the real estate securing our investment  national  regional and local economic conditions which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors  local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of housing  retail  industrial  office or other commercial space  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  construction quality  construction delays  construction cost  age and design  demographic factors  retroactive changes to building or similar codes  and increases in operating expenses such as energy costs 
in the event net operating income decreases  a borrower may have difficulty repaying our loans  which could result in losses to us 
in addition  decreases in property values reducing the value of collateral  and a lack of liquidity in the market  could reduce the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay our loans  which could also cause us to suffer losses 
even when the net operating income is sufficient to cover the related property debt service  there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
our operating results will depend in large part on differences between the income from our loans and our borrowing costs 
most of our loans and borrowings are variable rate instruments  based on libor 
the objective of this strategy is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on our net interest income 
in addition  we have various fixed rate loans in our portfolio  which are financed with 
table of contents variable rate libor borrowings 
we have entered into various interest swaps as discussed below to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk on our variable rate libor borrowings as it relates to our fixed rate loans 
some of our loans and borrowings are subject to various interest rate floors 
as a result  the impact of a change in interest rates may be different on our interest income than it is on our interest expense 
one month libor approximated at december  and at december  based on our loans  securities available for sale and liabilities as of december   and assuming the balances of these loans  securities and liabilities remain unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a increase in libor would increase our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
this is partially offset by various interest rate floors that are in effect at a rate that is above a increase in libor which would limit the effect of a increase  and increased expense on variable rate debt  partially offset by our interest rate swaps that effectively convert a portion of the variable rate libor based debt  as it relates to certain fixed rate assets  to a fixed basis that is not subject to a increase 
based on the loans  securities available for sale and liabilities as of december   and assuming the balances of these loans  securities and liabilities remain unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a decrease in libor would decrease our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
this is partially offset by various interest rate floors which limit the effect of a decrease on interest income and decreased expense on variable rate debt  partially offset by our interest rate swaps that effectively converted a portion of the variable rate libor based debt  as it relates to certain fixed rate assets  to a fixed basis that is not subject to a decrease 
based on our loans  securities available for sale  securities held to maturity and liabilities as of december   and assuming the balances of these loans  securities and liabilities remain unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a increase in libor would increase our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
this is partially offset by various interest rate floors that are in effect at a rate that is above a increase in libor which would limit the effect of a increase  and increased expense on variable rate debt  partially offset by our interest rate swaps that effectively convert a portion of the variable rate libor based debt  as it relates to certain fixed rate assets  to a fixed basis that is not subject to a increase 
based on the loans  securities available for sale  securities held to maturity and liabilities as of december   and assuming the balances of these loans  securities and liabilities remain unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a decrease in libor would decrease our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
this is primarily due to various interest rate floors which limit the effect of a decrease on interest income and decreased expense on variable rate debt  partially offset by our interest rate swaps that effectively converted a portion of the variable rate libor based debt  as it relates to certain fixed rate assets  to a fixed basis that is not subject to a decrease 
in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to us  which could adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
further  such delinquencies or defaults could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in connection with our cdos described in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the exposure to the risk of changes in the difference between three month libor and one month libor interest rates 
these interest rate swaps became necessary due to the cdo investor return being paid based on a three month libor index while the assets contributed to the cdos are yielding interest based on a one month libor index 
as of december  and  we had nine of these interest rate swap agreements outstanding that have combined notional values of billion 
the market value of these interest rate 
table of contents swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
if there were a basis point increase in forward interest rates as of december  and  respectively  the value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by less than million for both periods 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates as of december  and  respectively  the value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by less than million for both periods 
we also have interest rate swap agreements outstanding to hedge current and outstanding libor based debt relating to certain fixed rate loans within our portfolio 
we had of these interest rate swap agreements outstanding that had a combined notional value of million as of december  compared to interest rate swap agreements outstanding with combined notional values of million as of december  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
if there had been a basis point increase in forward interest rates as of december  and  respectively  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates as of december  and  respectively  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
we also have one libor cap with a notional value of million as of december if there were a basis point increase in forward interest rates as of december   the value of this libor cap would have increased by less than million 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates as of december   the value of this libor cap would have decreased by less than million 
certain of our interest rate swaps  which are designed to hedge interest rate risk associated with a portion of our loans and investments  could require the funding of additional cash collateral for changes in the market value of these swaps 
due to the prolonged volatility in the financial markets that began in  the value of these interest rate swaps has declined substantially 
as a result  at december  and  we funded approximately million and million  respectively  in cash related to these swaps 
if we continue to experience significant changes in the outlook of interest rates  these contracts could continue to decline in value  which would require additional cash to be funded 
however  at maturity the value of these contracts return to par and all cash will be recovered 
if we do not have available cash to meet these requirements  this could result in the early termination of these interest rate swaps  leaving us exposed to interest rate risk associated with these loans and investments  which could adversely impact our financial condition 
our hedging transactions using derivative instruments also involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
the counterparties to our derivative arrangements are major financial institutions with high credit ratings with which we and our affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
as a result  we do not anticipate that any of these counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and will ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging strategies 
we utilize interest rate swaps to limit interest rate risk 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes
