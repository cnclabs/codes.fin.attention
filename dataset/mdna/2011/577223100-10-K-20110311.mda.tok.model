overview we are a supplier of semiconductor wafer processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits ics 
our manufacturing equipment is used for semiconductor manufacturing and back end packaging 
our manufacturing equipment utilizes innovative technology to deliver advanced processing capabilities and high productivity for the fabrication of current and next generation ics 
we were incorporated in california in and reincorporated in delaware in our business depends upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductor devices 
the level of capital expenditures by these manufacturers depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for such devices 
because the demand for semiconductor devices is highly cyclical  the demand for wafer processing equipment is also highly cyclical 
the semiconductor equipment industry is typically characterized by wide swings in operating results as the industry moves through its cycle 
from late through  the industry experienced a sustained downturn 
in  our customers responded to an increasing demand for advanced products  expanding production by shrinking the chip size thus increasing the number of chips that could be produced on the wafer 
this technology driven phase of the cycle lasted roughly through the first half of as demand for chips continued through  the technology phase of the expansion was replaced by a capacity driven phase  in which our customers added to the number of wafers being produced in their existing factories 
the second half of was generally characterized by this capacity expansion phase as customers purchased equipment and in some cases filled their existing facilities to capacity 
this was especially the case in the foundry and dram memory sectors of chip making 
as these facilities were nearing completion  many of our larger customers started building new facilities or greenfield sites in preparation for their expected next round of expansion 
we anticipate that this greenfield expansion will occur in the timeframe  and be characterized by continued foundry purchases and a new round of memory expansion primarily driven by nand flash technology in support of the new tablet products  smartphones and the solid state drives for computing 
our real growth began in the second half of with the increase in capacity purchases by our customers 
the capacity purchases for our core products coupled with the introduction of significant revenue from our new etch products resulted in a percent increase in revenue from to  which we believe outpaced the overall industry growth 
last year we continued to strategically re position ourselves  investing in new product development and expanding our existing product portfolio across new product sectors and new applications within our core product sectors 
while we entered the downturn with products in two capacity driven sectors  we have emerged with products that address three diverse markets  with technology driven products that are aimed at a served available market almost triple the size of our previous market 
our dry strip products continue to ship to both foundry and memory customers and provide technical leadership in bulk stripping  high dose implant strip hdis and high k metal gate hkmg 
in  we expanded the market for our rtp products beyond dram  into logic and foundry fabs 
we shipped our next generation rtp system  the helios xp  to three leading semiconductor manufacturers and generated revenue from two of the top three nand flash customers 
we continue to make progress with our millisecond anneal technology  the millios  achieving process tool of record status for advanced logic and dram applications at one of the world largest semiconductor manufacturers 
most importantly  in we began to see traction of our strategic investment in our new etch product line 
we shipped our etch products to multiple customer accounts across foundry and memory lines  growing our etch revenues such that they represent over percent of our system revenues 
our etch products  the paradigme and alpine  are targeted to meet the stringent requirements of advanced dielectric etch as well as packaging applications 
in  we shipped paradigme to major dram and nand flash fabs and we also established the alpine product for volume production for advanced packaging 
the etch market represents a new market for us  and we believe it is significantly larger than our other market sectors 
in addition  the introduction of our etch product line will allow us to take better advantage of future cycle ramps for technology driven purchases in the semiconductor industry 
for  our new positions in etch and rtp  added to our broad strip base  expand our available market  especially in the new greenfield fabs  and transition us from productivity driven markets into more technology driven markets 
we believe that we are positioned at leading customers with strong balance sheets and the requisite resources to fully leverage these positions for improvements in our results with the continued strengthening of the global economy 
in  our revenue increased by million to million from million in  due to our product traction and successes  and the overall recovery in the global economy 
gross profit in was million compared to a negative million in the increase in gross profit was primarily due to operating leverage from higher net sales across all product lines  improved factory utilization and continued traction with our cost reduction measures 
our operating expenses in increased by percent  to million  but is significantly reduced from the levels prior to the downturn 
the slight increase in operating expenses was largely due to costs associated with the increased volume of sales and increased investment in our etch product line 
the impact of having better operating leverage from higher net sales and the cost reduction measures contributed to a lower net loss in of million compared to million in at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have incurred operating losses and generated negative cash flows for each of the last three years 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash of million and working capital of million 
we believe that these balances will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements over the course of the next twelve months 
our operations require careful management of our cash and working capital balances 
our liquidity is affected by many factors including  among others  fluctuations in our revenue  gross profits and operating expenses  as well as changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry makes it difficult for us to predict our future liquidity needs with certainty 
we will continue to review our expected cash requirements  make all efforts to collect any aged receivables  and take appropriate cost reduction measures to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity 
in the event additional needs for cash arise  we may seek to raise additional funds from a combination of sources including issuance of debt or equity securities 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
any additional financing activity could be dilutive to our current stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or respond to competitive pressures could be limited 
failure to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  raise additional capital or reduce spending could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended long term business objectives 
the success of our business will be dependent on numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the market demand for semiconductors and semiconductor wafer processing equipment 
such factors will also include our ability to a significantly grow the company  either organically or through acquisitions  in order to enhance our competitiveness and profitability  b develop and bring to market new products that address our customers needs  c grow customer loyalty through collaboration with and support of our customers  d maintain a cost structure that will enable us to operate effectively and profitably throughout changing industry cycles and e generate the gross profits necessary to enable us to make the necessary investments in our business 
results of operations years ended december  and the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and  and the year over year increase decrease in our results  expressed both in dollar amounts in thousands and as a percentage of net sales  except where indicated year ended december  increase decrease thousands thousands thousands net sales    cost of sales  gross profit loss  n m operating expenses research  development and engineering   selling  general and administrative   restructuring charges n m total operating expenses  loss from operations    interest income interest expense other income expense  net loss before income taxes   provision for benefit from income taxes n m net income loss  not meaningful net sales 
net sales were million in  an increase of million or percent  compared to million in the increase in net sales was primarily due to the improvement in the global economy and the semiconductor equipment sector 
the low level of net sales in reflected the trough of the downturn in the semiconductor equipment industry 
since sales bottomed out in the first quarter of  we have experienced seven consecutive quarters of growth  as the upturn has moved from a period of principally technology purchases to the current capacity building phase of the cycle 
accordingly  the year over year increase in sales was broad based across all of our products 
in addition  our penetration of the etch market during contributed over percent to our system sales compared with approximately percent in in  international sales to customers in europe and asia  including china  japan  singapore  south korea and taiwan  continued to account for a significant portion of our total net sales  comprising approximately percent of net sales in  compared to percent in we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales consists of the costs associated with manufacturing our products  and includes the purchase of raw materials and related overhead  labor  warranty costs  charges for excess and obsolete inventory and costs incurred by our contract manufacturers in the production of our components  major subassemblies modules and complete systems 
cost of sales was million in  an increase of million or percent  compared to million in the increase in cost of sales was primarily related to costs associated with increased product sales resulting from improved market conditions in and realizing the benefits of previous cost reduction efforts described more fully in note restructuring charges 
gross profit loss 
gross profit loss is calculated as net sales less cost of sales 
gross margin rate is gross profit loss reflected as a percentage of net sales 
gross margin rate improved to percent in  compared to a negative percent in the increase in gross margin in was primarily due to operating leverage from higher net sales volumes  sales of previously written down inventories and an increase in absorption levels  partially offset by an increase in warranty provisions related to the higher net sales 
our gross margin rate has varied over the years and will continue to be affected by many factors  including competitive pressures  product mix  inventory reserves  economies of scale  material and other costs  overhead absorption levels and the timing of revenue recognition 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  development and engineering activities  costs of product development and depreciation on equipment used in the course of research  development and engineering activities 
research  development and engineering expenses were million in  an increase of million or percent  compared to million in the increase in research  development and engineering expenses was primarily due to a million increase in materials used in new product development projects and a million increase in salaries and related costs resulting from increased headcount and a reduction in the number of work furloughs throughout  partially offset by a decrease of million in depreciation and amortization related to equipment that was fully depreciated in selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  as well as legal and professional fees  facilities expenses excluding research and development focused sites  insurance expenses  amortization of evaluation systems and certain information technology costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million or percent  compared to million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the higher level of revenues and related business activities in  including increases in costs related to freight and duty  legal fees  sales commissions and amortization of evaluation systems  partially offset by a million reduction year over year in the collection of certain accounts receivable previously provided for in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
restructuring charges 
in response to declining revenues  we implemented several restructuring programs to dramatically reduce our cost structure in and  which combined to reduce our workforce by approximately percent over those two years 
restructuring charges recorded under these programs were primarily for estimated employee severance costs and lease termination costs  which have since been adjusted to reflect revised estimates and actual amounts paid 
in  based on revised estimates  we reversed a net million in restructuring reserves  which is included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
in  restructuring expenses were million  representing million in severance costs and million in lease termination costs 
as of december   we had a total restructuring reserves balance of million  comprised of severance costs of million and lease termination costs of million 
we anticipate that remaining severance payments against the reserves will be substantially completed in the first half of with respect to the lease termination  we are currently engaged in an ongoing negotiation with the landlord  and the payment of the lease termination expense is dependent on the timing of a final agreement with the landlord 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest income was million in  a decrease of million when compared to million in the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower cash investment balances during fiscal other income expense  net was million of income in  a decrease of million when compared to million of income in the decrease in foreign currency gain was due to the significant fluctuation of the us dollar against the foreign currencies in which certain of our accounts receivable and or accounts payable balances were denominated during provision for benefit from income taxes 
provision for benefit from income taxes was a million net provision in  which consisted of a million provision for foreign taxes partially offset by a million benefit for federal and state income taxes 
provision for benefit from income taxes in was a million net benefit  which consisted of a million benefit from the settlement of a german tax audit for tax years to  partially offset by provisions for foreign taxes and for federal and state income taxes of million and million  respectively 
currently  we have provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets for all jurisdictions except germany as we have determined that  due to uncertainties and other negative evidence in our current operations and our expectations of future operations  it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets generated from net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our provision for income taxes could be favorably impacted going forward if our results of operations and forecasts for future profitability improve sufficiently to indicate that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
conversely  our provision for income taxes could be unfavorably impacted in the future if the results of operations and future profitability of our german business decline sufficiently to indicate the related deferred tax asset will not be realized 
such a change in management expectations could result in a material change to our valuation allowance assessment and the resulting income tax provision 
years ended december  and the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and  and the year over year increase decrease in our results  expressed both in dollar amounts in thousands and as a percentage of net sales  except where indicated year ended december  increase decrease thousands thousands thousands net sales    cost of sales  gross profit loss  n m operating expenses research  development and engineering   selling  general and administrative   restructuring charges    impairment of goodwill   n m impairment of intangibles and long lived assets n m total operating expenses  loss from operations    interest income   interest expense other income expense  net  n m loss before income taxes   provision for benefit from income taxes  n m net income loss  not meaningful net sales 
net sales were million in  a decrease of million or percent  compared to million in the decline in net sales was comprised of a percent decrease in product revenue  and a percent decrease in spares parts and services revenues 
in  we received our final royalty payment of million from the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit against dainippon screen manufacturing co  ltd dns 
the decline in our net sales was primarily due to the severity of the continued downturn in the overall wafer fabrication equipment market  the industry reduced capital spending  and excess supplies at our customers fabs 
in  international sales to customers in europe and asia  including china  japan  singapore  south korea and taiwan continued to account for a significant portion of our total net sales  comprising approximately percent of net sales in  compared to percent in cost of sales 
cost of sales was million in  a decrease of million or percent  compared to million in the decrease in cost of sales was primarily related to the sharp decline in our net sales related to the global economic slowdown  which resulted in under absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead costs and significant charges for excess and obsolete inventory 
gross profit loss 
gross margin rate decreased to a negative percent in  compared to percent in the decrease is primarily due to under absorption of fixed manufacturing costs caused by lower production levels as well as additional inventory reserves 
royalty revenue  with no offsetting costs  of million from dns favorably impacted gross profit in research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expenses were million in  a decrease of million or percent  compared to million in the decrease in research  development and engineering expenses was primarily comprised of a million reduction in salaries and other employee costs  a million reduction in project material expenditures and a million reduction in travel and outside service expenses 
these decreases were the result of ongoing cost reduction activities implemented since fiscal  consisting of work furloughs  workforce reductions and spending reductions in certain research  development and engineering projects 
additionally  having determined intangible assets had been impaired and written off in the fourth quarter of  as discussed below  there was no intangible amortization expense in compared to million in selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  a decrease of million or percent  compared to million in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily comprised of a million net decrease in salaries and other employee costs  a million decrease in outside service expenses  a million decrease in travel expenses and a million reduction in freight costs 
these decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses were primarily due to reductions in certain costs attributable to the decrease in revenues and cost reduction activities implemented since fiscal in  we also benefited from collecting million of accounts receivable previously provided for in the allowance for doubtful accounts during the recent industry downturn 
restructuring charges 
beginning in the second quarter of through the third quarter of  we implemented several restructuring plans in response to declining revenues 
the restructuring initiatives in and resulted in a combined reduction of approximately percent of our workforce over those two years 
in connection with the restructuring activities in  we recognized restructuring charges of million  comprised of million in severance costs and million in lease termination costs  and in  we recognized restructuring charges of million  comprised of million in severance costs and million in lease termination costs 
our cost cutting initiatives in both and also included activities that did not result in restructuring charges  such as i better utilization of assets  including focused reduction of existing inventories  ii reduced variable headcount expenses through shutdowns and unpaid time off  and iii cash conservation and spending cuts in travel  outside service  project material and other research  development and engineering and selling  general and administrative related costs 
impairment of goodwill 
in  we had no goodwill impairment charges 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the remaining carrying amount of goodwill  as the value of goodwill deteriorated to zero due to the significant declines in our revenues and market capitalization 
impairment of intangibles and long lived assets 
in  we had no impairment charges related to intangibles or long lived assets 
in  we recorded impairment charges to write off intangible assets of million  the remaining carrying amount of purchased technology acquired in connection with our acquisition of vortek in  and certain lab assets of million to adjust for the deteriorating value of these assets resulting from the decline in expected cash flows attributable to the assets 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest income was million in  a decrease of million when compared to million in the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower cash investment balances and lower average interest rate yields during fiscal our average interest yield was percentage points in compared to percentage points in fiscal other income  net was million in  an increase of million compared to an expense of million in the increase in other income  net is primarily due to a net foreign currency exchange gain of million and other income of million in  compared to a foreign currency exchange loss of million and other expense of million in the increase in foreign currency gain was due to the significant fluctuation of the us dollar against the foreign currencies in which certain of our accounts receivable and or accounts payable balances were denominated during provision for benefit from income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in primarily consisted of a million benefit from the settlement of a german tax audit for the tax years from to  offset by a provision for foreign taxes of million and a provision for federal and state income taxes of million resulting in an overall tax benefit of million 
the provision for income taxes in primarily consisted of a million provision for foreign taxes 
as of december   we had provided a full valuation allowance for all jurisdictions except germany as we have determined that  due to uncertainties and other negative evidence in our current operations and our expectations of future operations  it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets generated from net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets would not be realized 
other stock based compensation 
stock based compensation totaled million in  million in and million in the decrease in stock based compensation in compared to was primarily due to cancellation of stock options in connection with headcount reductions in the second half of and in as of december   unrecognized stock based compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows weighted unrecognized share based weighted compensation average cost period millions years stock options restricted stock units liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments were million as of december   a decrease of million from million as of december  stockholders equity as of december  was million compared to million as of december  working capital as of december  was million compared to million as of december  liquidity and capital resources outlook at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have incurred operating losses and generated negative cash flows for each of the last three years 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash of million and working capital of million 
our operations require careful management of our cash and working capital balances 
our liquidity is affected by many factors including  among others  fluctuations in our revenue  gross profits and operating expenses  as well as changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry makes it difficult for us to predict our future liquidity needs with certainty 
any upturn in the semiconductor industry would result in short term uses of our cash to fund inventory purchases and accounts receivable 
alternatively  any renewed softening in the demand for our products or ineffectiveness of our cost reduction efforts may cause us to incur additional losses in the future and lower our cash balances 
we may need additional funds to support our working capital requirements  operating expenses or for other requirements 
historically  we have relied on a combination of fundraising from the sale and issuance of equity securities and cash generated from product  service and royalty revenues to provide funding for our operations 
we will continue to review our expected cash requirements  make all efforts to collect any aged receivables  and take appropriate cost reduction measures to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity 
in the event additional needs for cash arise  we may seek to raise these funds externally through public or private debt or equity financing  or through the sale of assets 
the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors  including among others  market conditions  the general availability of credit to the financial services industry and our credit ratings 
as a consequence  these financing options may not be available to us on a timely basis  or on terms acceptable to us  and could be dilutive to our shareholders 
our current liquidity position may result in risks and uncertainties affecting our operations and financial position  including the following we may be required to reduce planned expenditures or investments  we may be unable to compete in our newer or developing markets  we may not be able to obtain and maintain normal terms with suppliers  suppliers may require standby letters of credit before delivering goods and services  which will result in additional demands on our cash  customers may delay or discontinue entering into contracts with us  and our ability to retain management and other key individuals may be negatively affected 
failure to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  raise additional capital or reduce spending could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended long term business objectives 
credit arrangements in june  our million revolving line of credit expired  and has not been renewed or replaced 
the line of credit was collateralized by a blanket lien on all of our domestic assets  excluding intellectual property assets 
we used this credit line principally to secure standby letters of credit provided to certain landlords and vendors  and we did not borrow or have outstanding borrowings under this line of credit at any time during its term 
as a replacement for the security that was provided by the expired line of credit  these standby letters of credit are now secured by certificates of deposit  which are classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets 
contractual obligations under us generally accepted accounting principles  certain obligations and commitments are not required to be included in our consolidated balance sheet 
these obligations and commitments  while entered into in the normal course of business  may have a material impact on our liquidity 
our contractual commitments as of december  are summarized in the following table operating vendor commitments lease sub total payments contractor inventory other total commitments thousands thereafter  other vendor commitments primarily include service related contracts and agreements for information technology support  commitments for non inventory purchases of assets  and other service related commitments 
we continue to lease a building that previously housed the administrative functions of our wet surface preparation products in exton  pennsylvania under a noncancellable lease  expiring in march in january  we entered into a sublease agreement for the facility  which was subsequently terminated and replaced in june by a new agreement to sublease approximately percent of the exton facility until december  cancellable anytime after december  under the existing sublease agreement  we have approximately million of expected future sublease income as of december  in determining facilities lease loss liability  various assumptions were made  including the time period over which the buildings will be vacant  expected sublease terms and expected sublease rates 
at december   we had an accrued liability balance of million related to this facility 
adjustments to this accrual will be made in future periods  if evidence of any adjustment can be reasonably estimated as future events and circumstances become known 
our deferred income taxes have been excluded from the table above because the related future cash outflows are uncertain 
as of december   we had approximately million of net unrecognized tax benefits that may be subject to examination by applicable tax authorities 
in connection with the acquisition of vortek industries  ltd vortek in  we became party to an agreement between vortek and the canadian minister of industry the minister pertaining to an investment in vortek by technology partnerships canada 
under the agreement  as amended  mattson technology  inc or vortek renamed mattson technology  canada  inc or mtc agreed to various covenants  including i payment by us of a royalty to the minister of percent of revenues from flash rtp products  up to a total of cad million approximately million based on the applicable exchange rate at december   ii mtc maintaining a specified average workforce of employees in canada through october   iii investment of a certain amount by october  and certain other covenants concerning protection of intellectual property rights and manufacturing obligations 
also  under the provisions of this agreement  if we  or mtc  did not materially satisfy our obligations pursuant to the covenants  the minister could have demanded payment of liquidated damages in the amount of cad million less any royalties paid by mtc or us to the minister 
as of december   we are no longer subject to covenants ii and iii of this agreement  as discussed above  but we are still subject to covenant i  relating to payment of royalty to the minister until however  if mtc is dissolved  files for bankruptcy or does not materially comply with certain terms and conditions of the contract prior to its expiration on december   we would be subject to liquidated damages in the amount of cad million less any royalties paid by mtc or by us to the minister 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
legal settlement in march  a jury in san jose  california rendered a verdict in favor of our then subsidiary  mattson wet products  inc formally cfm technologies  inc  in a patent infringement suit against dainippon screen manufacturing co  ltd 
dns  a japanese manufacturer of semiconductor wafer processing equipment 
in june  we entered into a settlement agreement and a license agreement with dns  under which dns agreed to make payments to us totaling between million minimum and million maximum for past damages  partial reimbursement of attorney fees and costs and license fees 
dns paid its last royalty payment to us in may  and as of that date had paid us a total of million  which satisfied all of its obligations to us pursuant to the settlement and license agreements 
we recognized royalty revenue of million in  the final year for such royalties  which are reflected as a component of net sales in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for that year 
cash flows from operating activities in  net cash used in operations was million  comprised primarily of a net loss of million and million of cash decreases reflected in the net change in assets and liabilities  partially offset by non cash charges of million 
cash flow decreases resulting from the net change in assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a million increase in accounts receivable and advance billings  an million increase in inventories and a decrease in accrued liabilities and non current liabilities  partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable  a million increase in deferred revenue and a million combined decrease in prepaid expenses  other current assets and other assets

critical accounting policies and use of estimates management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty obligations  bad debts  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the basis for making judgment about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty obligations  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  restructuring  income taxes and stock based compensation as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from these primary sources equipment tool sales  spare part sales and service and maintenance contracts 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance on revenue recognition  we recognize revenue on equipment sales as follows i for equipment sales of existing products with new specifications and for sales of new products  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance  ii for equipment sales to existing customers who have purchased the same equipment with the same specifications and previously demonstrated acceptance  or equipment sales to new customers purchasing existing products with established reliability  we recognize revenue on a multiple element approach in which we bifurcate such sale transactions into two separate elements based on objective evidence of fair value 
the two elements are the tool and installation 
under this approach  generally percent of the total invoice amount  is recognized as revenue upon shipment and transfer of title  percent of the associated tool costs is also recognized upon shipment  and the remaining portion  generally percent of the total invoice amount  is recognized once installation services are completed and final customer acceptance of the tool is received 
from time to time  we allow customers to evaluate systems  while maintaining the right to return the systems at their discretion with limited or no penalty 
for this type of arrangement  we do not recognize revenue on the evaluation systems until customer acceptance is received 
for spare parts  we recognize revenue upon shipment 
for service and maintenance contracts  we recognize revenue on a straight line basis over the service period of the related contract 
in all cases  revenue is only recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
accounts receivable for which revenue has not been recognized are classified as advance billings 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and record specific allowances for bad debts when a customer is unable to meet its financial obligations  as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deteriorated financial position 
we estimate the allowances for bad debts for all other customers based on factors such as current trends  the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
we write off a receivable when all rights  remedies and recourses against the account and its principals are exhausted and record a benefit when previously reserved accounts are collected 
warranty 
the warranty we offer on system sales is generally months  except where previous customer agreements state otherwise 
a provision for the estimated cost of warranty  based on historical costs  is recorded as a cost of sale when the revenue is recognized for the sale of the equipment or parts 
our warranty obligations require us to repair or replace defective products or parts during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
the actual system performance and or field expense profiles may differ from historical experience  and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly 
actual warranty reserves and settlements against reserves are highly dependent on our system volumes 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions we have established  we cannot be certain that we will continue to experience the same warranty costs that we have had in the past 
inventories 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis  and include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer 
under our general terms of sale  title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail 
all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from the consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including manufacturing raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts  in each reporting period 
although we attempt to accurately forecast future inventory demand  given the competitive pressures and cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  there may be significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments that could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results 
the carrying value of our inventory is reduced for estimated excess and obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
we evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fair value measurements of assets and liabilities 
we measure certain of our assets at fair value  using observable market data 
the authoritative guidance on fair value measurement defines fair value as an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants  and establishes valuation hierarchy based on the level of independent objective evidence available regarding the value of assets or liabilities 
the authoritative guidance also establishes three classes of assets or liabilities level consists of assets and liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets  level consists of assets and liabilities for which observable inputs other than level inputs are used such as prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or for identical assets or liabilities in less active markets and model derived valuations for which the variables are derived from or corroborated by observable market data  and level consists of assets and liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value 
our cash equivalents and investment instruments are classified within level or level of the fair value hierarchy  as these instruments are valued using quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency and transaction value 
we had no assets or liabilities classified within level as of december  goodwill 
we perform a goodwill impairment test annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment may have occurred 
such events or circumstances may include significant adverse changes in the general business climate  among other things 
the impairment test is performed by determining our fair value based on estimated discounted future cash flows and considering the market price of our common stock 
if our carrying value  as a one reporting unit entity  is less than our fair value  then the fair value is allocated to all of our assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if our fair value was the purchase price to acquire us 
the excess of our fair value over the amounts assigned to our assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
based on the deteriorating macroeconomic conditions  the weakness in the semiconductor market and significant erosion of our market capitalization during fiscal  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  representing the remaining carrying amount of goodwill as of the date of the impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal as of december  and  there was no goodwill on our books 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment  intangibles and other long lived assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
in  we recorded impairment charges to write off intangible assets of million and certain lab assets of million to adjust for the deteriorating value of these assets resulting from the decline in expected cash flows attributable to the assets 
there were no such impairment charges in and restructuring 
we recognize expenses related to employee termination benefits when the benefit arrangement is communicated to the employee and no significant future services are required 
if an employee is required to render service until a specific termination date in order to receive the termination benefits  the fair value of the associated liability would be recognized ratably over the future service period 
the costs of severance are determined by local statutory requirements and our policies 
for some entities  where salaries are paid during the notice period  a portion of the severance reserves would be based on estimates of the ability to find employment during the notice period  and we would determine the reserves in accordance with these estimates 
we recognize the present value of facility lease termination obligations  net of estimated sublease income and other exit costs  when we have future lease payments with no future economic benefit 
in future periods  we will record accretion expense to increase the liability to an amount equal to the estimated future cash payments necessary to exit the lease 
this requires a significant amount of judgment and management estimation in order to determine the expected time frame it will take to secure a subtenant  the amount of sublease income to be received and the appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of the future cash flows 
if actual lease exit costs differ from estimates  we would adjust the restructuring charge  which would impact net income in the period any adjustment was recorded 
income taxes 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution for all tax jurisdictions with the exception of our german operations  we recorded a percent valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset as we expect it is more likely than not that we will not realize our net deferred tax asset as of december  in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider historical levels of income and losses  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize additional deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  or if we subsequently determine that realization of an amount previously recorded is unlikely  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  which would change income in the period of the adjustment 
stock based compensation 
we measure the fair value of all stock based awards  including stock options  restricted stock units  and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan  on the date of grant  and we recognize the related stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of certain of our stock based awards 
the determination of fair value using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  which includes expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee exercise and cancellation behaviors  risk free interest rates  and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected life of options based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option  expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock  and the risk free interest rate is equal to the us treasury rates  with maturity approximating the expected life of the option 
we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future  accordingly  the expected dividend yield is zero 
we estimate forfeiture rates on stock based awards at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
such forfeiture estimates are based on historical experience 
if the assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense change in future periods  the amount of future stock based compensation may differ significantly from the amounts we recorded in the current and prior periods 
stock based compensation expenses in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued additional guidance on fair value disclosures 
the new guidance clarifies two existing disclosure requirements and requires two new disclosures as follows a gross presentation of activities purchases  sales  and settlements within the level rollforward reconciliation  which will replace the net presentation format  and detailed disclosures about the transfers in and out of level and measurements 
this guidance is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after december   except for the gross presentation of the level rollforward information  which is required for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and for interim reporting periods thereafter 
we adopted the amended fair value disclosures guidance on january  in  we did not have any assets or liabilities subject to level measurement  but will present under the gross presentation of activities format should we have any in the future 
accordingly  as of december   we had fully adopted this new guidance 
in october  the fasb amended the criteria in asc topic  revenue recognition  relating to separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
as a result of the amendment  multiple deliverable arrangements will be separated in more circumstances than under existing revenue recognitions standards 
the amendment establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
such selling price for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
the amendment also replaces the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant 
this amendment is effective for revenue arrangements that begin or are changed in fiscal years starting after june  and early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on our revenue recognition policies as well as the impact on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb amended asc topic certain revenue arrangements that include software to address the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 
under the amendment  tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product essential functionality are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance in asc subtopic formerly sop  software revenue recognition 
in addition  the amendment requires that hardware components of a tangible product containing software components must always be excluded from the software revenue guidance 
if software contained in a tangible product is essential to the tangible product functionality  the software is excluded from the scope of the software revenue guidance 
this exclusion includes essential software that is sold with or embedded within the product and undelivered software elements that relate to that tangible product essential software 
this amendment also provides guidance on how a vendor should allocate arrangement consideration to deliverables in an arrangement that includes both tangible products and software 
this amendment is effective for revenue arrangements that begin or are changed in fiscal years starting after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on our revenue recognition policies as well as the impact on our financial statements 
in august  the fasb amended asc topic  fair value measurements  to clarify that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  an entity is required to use the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset  quoted prices for similar liabilities  or quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as assets 
if these quoted prices are not available an entity is required to use another valuation technique  such as an income approach or a market approach 
our adoption of the amended guidance  effective in the first quarter of fiscal year  will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks related foreign exchange rates 
we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk as of december   our investment portfolio consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash and million in short term investments 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio and the potential losses arising from changes in interest rates 
our investment objective is to achieve the maximum return compatible with capital preservation and our liquidity requirements 
our strategy is to invest our cash in a manner that preserves capital  maintains sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements  and maximizes yields consistent with approved credit risk 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer 
our portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we classify our cash equivalents and short term investments in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for investments in debt and equity securities  consider investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents  and classify our short term investments as available for sale 
our cash equivalents and short term investment portfolios consist primarily of money market funds  commercial paper and us government and government sponsored debt securities 
our short term investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  included in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments  realized gains and losses  and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
based on the size of the investment portfolio as of december   an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points would not have a material adverse effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currencies 
accordingly  all assets and liabilities of these foreign operations are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period  and revenues and costs are translated using average exchange rates for the period 
gains or losses from translation of foreign operations where the local currencies are the functional currency  are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred 
because much of our revenues and capital spending are transacted in us dollars  we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could have a material adverse effect on our overall financial position  results of operations or cash flows  depending on the strength of the us dollar relative to the currencies of other countries in which we operate 
exchange rate fluctuations of greater than ten percent  primarily for the us dollar relative to the euro  canadian dollar or south korean won  could have a material impact on our financial statements 
additionally  foreign currency transaction gains and losses fluctuate depending upon the mix of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and whether the local currency of an entity strengthens or weakens during a period 
in  and  we recorded foreign currency exchange gains and losses of zero  million and a negative million  respectively  in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
foreign currency translation adjustments included in comprehensive income for were a negative million  primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro  which unfavorably impacted the net assets used in our foreign operations and held in local currencies 
the cumulative translation adjustment as of december  was million  compared to million as of december
