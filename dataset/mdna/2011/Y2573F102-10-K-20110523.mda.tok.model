table of contents overview we are a leading provider of advanced design and electronics manufacturing services ems to original equipment manufacturers oems of a broad range of products in the following markets infrastructure  mobile communication devices  computing  consumer digital devices  industrial  semiconductor capital equipment  clean technology  aerospace and defense  and white goods  automotive and marine  and medical devices 
we provide a full range of vertically integrated global supply chain services through which we can design  build  ship and service a complete packaged product for our customers 
customers leverage our services to meet their product requirements throughout the entire product life cycle 
our vertically integrated service offerings include design services  rigid and flexible printed circuit board fabrication  systems assembly and manufacturing  after sales services  and multiple component product offerings 
historically  the ems industry experienced significant change and growth as an increasing number of companies elected to outsource some or all of their design and manufacturing requirements 
we have seen an increase in the penetration of the global oem manufacturing requirements since the technology downturn as more and more oems pursued the benefits of outsourcing rather than internal manufacturing 
in the second half of fiscal  we experienced dramatically deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and demand for our customers products slowed in all of the industries we serve 
this global economic crisis  and related decline in demand for our customers products  put pressure on certain of our oem customers cost structures and caused them to reduce their manufacturing and supply chain outsourcing requirements 
beginning in the second half of fiscal year  we began seeing some positive signs that demand for our oem customers end products was improving  and this trend continued through the end of our fiscal year 
we are one of the world largest ems providers  with revenues of billion in fiscal year as of march   our total manufacturing capacity was approximately million square feet 
we design  build  ship  and service electronics products for our customers through a network of facilities in countries across four continents 
we have established an extensive network of manufacturing facilities in the world major electronics markets asia  the americas and europe in order to serve the growing outsourcing needs of both multinational and regional oems 
in fiscal year  our net sales in asia  the americas and europe represented approximately  and  respectively  of our total net sales  based on the location of the manufacturing site 
the following tables set forth net sales and net property and equipment  by country  based on the location of our manufacturing sites fiscal year ended march  net sales in thousands china mexico u

table of contents fiscal year ended march  long lived assets in thousands china mexico u 
s malaysia hungary other we believe that the combination of our extensive design and engineering services  significant scale and global presence  vertically integrated end to end services  advanced supply chain management  industrial campuses in low cost geographic areas and operational track record provide us with a competitive advantage in the market for designing  manufacturing and servicing electronics products for leading multinational and regional oems 
through these services and facilities  we offer our oem customers the ability to simplify their global product development  manufacturing process  and after sales services  and enable them to achieve meaningful time to market and cost savings 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors  including the following changes in the macroeconomic environment and related changes in consumer demand  the mix of the manufacturing services we are providing  the number and size of new manufacturing programs  the degree to which we utilize our manufacturing capacity  seasonal demand  shortages of components and other factors  the effects on our business when our customers are not successful in marketing their products  or when their products do not gain widespread commercial acceptance  our increased components offerings which have required that we make substantial investments in the resources necessary to design and develop these products  our ability to achieve commercially viable production yields and to manufacture components in commercial quantities to the performance specifications demanded by our oem customers  our increased design service business offering and related investments and start up and production ramping costs  effect on our business due to our customers products having short product life cycles  our customers ability to cancel or delay orders or change production quantities  our customers decision to choose internal manufacturing instead of outsourcing for their product requirements  our exposure to financially troubled customers  and integration of acquired businesses and facilities 
we also are subject to other risks as outlined in item a  risk factors 
we recognized substantial revenue and profit growth during fiscal we believe that we finished the year in a healthy financial and competitive position driven in part by the success in our diversified business model 
the overall improvement in the macroeconomic environment during fiscal and the success in booking new product orders for our array of key customers led to increased demand for our oem customers ends products across all of our major markets 
the vast majority of 
table of contents our sales growth during the year was organic  as the impact from acquisitions was minimal 
net sales during fiscal year totaled billion  representing an increase of billion  or  compared to fiscal year our fiscal gross profit totaled billion  representing an increase of million  or  compared to fiscal driven primarily by increased sales  better facility utilization  cost controls  and the avoidance of any meaningful restructuring costs 
our net income of million improved significantly compared to million in fiscal reflecting the improvements in sales and gross margin noted above as well as increased leverage of our selling  general  and administrative expenses and decreased net interest expenses due to lower borrowing costs and debt repayments during the fiscal year 
our diluted earnings per share was for fiscal compared to in fiscal our cash provided by operations increased approximately million to million for fiscal year compared with million for fiscal year working capital increased by million in fiscal primarily as a result of increases in inventory  resulting from our increased production and anticipated continued growth  and increases in other current assets resulting from increases in our deferred purchase price receivable associated with our asset backed securitization programs 
these increases were partially offset by increases in our accounts payables and other current liabilities 
our average net working capital  defined as accounts receivable plus the deferred purchase price receivable from our asset backed securitization programs plus inventory less accounts payable  as a percentage of annual sales was approximately for fiscal compared to for fiscal our free cash flow  which we define as cash from operating activities less net purchases of property and equipment  was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  due in part to increased purchases of property and equipment  net of proceeds for disposals  to support our sales growth 
cash used in financing activities amounted to million during fiscal and included a repurchase of approximately million shares at an aggregate purchase price of million  including accrued expenses 
we experienced significant volume increases in our component product solution services throughout fiscal year as a result of this steep growth and other challenges faced by our component product solution services  our aggregate results for these services have been performing at below optimal levels 
our manufacturing efficiencies and production yields continued to improve and during fiscal year our component product solution services made progress reducing their aggregate operating losses 
we are encouraged by the increased demand for these product solutions and the successful achievement of acceptance in the market  and we remain intensely focused on further improving our manufacturing efficiencies and thus our future margins and profitability 
our component product solution services  on a combined basis  accounted for less than of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended march  in addition  during fiscal year our high volume computing design services offering experienced acute inflationary pressures  principally around raw materials and labor  which was widespread across the industry in which it competes 
we also experienced significant volume increases as we ramped production for various new programs throughout fiscal year and more significantly in our fourth quarter 
in connection with these significant increasing volumes we have experienced manufacturing inefficiencies due to greater start up costs and resource requirements 
as a result  our margins and our results of operations were negatively affected 
we procure a wide assortment of materials  including electronic components  plastics and metals 
we experienced shortages of numerous commodity components  such as capacitors  connectors  semiconductor and power components  during the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year these shortages began to abate during our second fiscal quarter  and supplies had normalized by the end of the third quarter 
we do not expect that our revenues or operations will be materially affected by the recent japan earthquake and tsunami as operations in japan constitutes a relatively small component of our consolidated revenue and our facilities in japan remain intact and undamaged 
however  we are 
table of contents analyzing the broader effects on our industry as a large number of suppliers to the global market for semiconductors and other electronic components are located in japan and the disaster therefore may result in disruptions to our supply chain 
we are very pleased with the improvements in revenue and profitability during fiscal as well as our competitive position in the industry 
we continue to believe that the long term  future growth prospects for outsourcing of advanced manufacturing capabilities  design and engineering services and after market services are and will remain strong 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap or gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements
