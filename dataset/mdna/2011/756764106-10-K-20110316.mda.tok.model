item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a nyse listed hospitality and leisure company ticker symbols rlh and rlh pa primarily engaged in the ownership  operation and franchising of midscale  full  select and limited service hotels under our proprietary red lion brand 
established over years ago  the red lion brand is nationally recognized and particularly well known in the western united states  where all of our hotels are located 
the red lion brand is typically associated with three star full and select service hotels 
as of december   our hotel system contained hotels located in eight states and one canadian province  with  rooms and  square feet of meeting space as provided below total meeting available space hotels rooms sq 
ft 
red lion owned and leased hotels red lion franchised hotels total we operate in three reportable segments the hotels segment derives revenue primarily from guest room rentals and food and beverage operations at our owned and leased hotels 
the franchise segment is engaged primarily in licensing the red lion brand to franchisees 
this segment generates revenue from franchise fees that are typically based on a percent of room revenues and are charged to hotel owners in exchange for the use of our brand and access to our central services programs 
these programs include the reservation system  guest loyalty program  national and regional sales  revenue management tools  quality inspections  advertising and brand standards 
it has also historically reflected revenue from management fees charged to the owners of managed hotels 
we have not managed any hotels for third parties since january the entertainment segment derives revenue primarily from ticketing services and promotion and presentation of entertainment productions 
our remaining activities  none of which constitutes a reportable segment  have been aggregated into other  and are primarily related to our direct ownership interest in a retail mall that is attached to one of our hotels and to other miscellaneous real estate investments 
results of operations for the year ended december   our net loss was million or per share  which includes a non cash impairment charge of million related to the termination of a franchise and sublease agreement 
during the fourth quarter of  we agreed to terminate the current sublease and franchise agreement with the operator of the red lion hotel sacramento

also included in the net loss is million of expense related to the separation of a former president and chief executive officer 
during  we reported a net loss of million or per share  which included a non cash impairment charge of million

subsequent to that acquisition  the denver market experienced a substantial and sustained decline in demand for hotel rooms across all market segments 
the remaining million impairment charge related to a second property 
during  we reported a net loss of approximately million or per share 
included in this loss was a million charge recorded during the first quarter of for separation costs associated with the retirement of a former president and chief executive officer

during the first quarter of  the company terminated an employment agreement with its president and chief executive officer 
as a result  separation costs of million were recorded in that quarter 
during the first quarter of  the then president and chief executive officer of the company retired 
in connection therewith  we recorded separation payment and benefit expense of million 
during the fourth quarter of  an employment agreement was terminated with an executive vice president resulting in an expense of million for separation payments and other benefits  including a million non cash expense for the unvested portion of the former executive s stock options and restricted stock units that immediately vested upon termination 
includes a non cash charge of million reducing the carrying value of an intangible asset related to a management contract acquired with the westcoast and red lion brands 
includes restructuring costs associated with a reduction in force implemented to manage costs 
during the fourth quarter of  a sublease agreement was terminated for our red lion hotel sacramento 
as a result  we accelerated the recognition of million of deferred lease income associated with that contract 
additional adjustments in the amount of million were necessary to reflect uncollectible amounts and accrued expenses  which partially offset the deferred lease income adjustment 
ebitda represents net income loss attributable to red lion hotels corporation before interest expense  income tax expense benefit and depreciation and amortization 
we utilize ebitda as a financial measure because management believes that investors find it a useful tool to perform more meaningful comparisons of past  present and future operating results and as a means to evaluate the results of core  ongoing operations 
we believe it is a complement to net income loss attributable to red lion hotels corporation and other financial performance measures 
ebitda is not intended to represent net income loss attributable to red lion hotels corporation as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  and such information should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss  cash flows from operations or any other measure of performance prescribed by gaap 
we use ebitda to measure the financial performance of our owned and leased hotels because we believe interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization bear little or no relationship to our operating performance 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda measures our financial performance irrespective of our capital structure or how we finance our properties and operations 
we generally pay federal and state income taxes on a consolidated basis  taking into account how the applicable taxing laws apply to us in the aggregate 
by excluding taxes on income  we believe ebitda provides a basis for measuring the financial performance of our operations excluding factors that our hotels cannot control 
by excluding depreciation and amortization expense  which can vary from hotel to hotel based on historical cost and other factors unrelated to the hotels financial performance  ebitda measures the financial performance of our hotels without regard to their historical cost 
for all of these reasons  we believe ebitda provides us and investors with information that is relevant and useful in evaluating our business 
however  because ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization  it does not measure the capital we require to maintain or preserve our fixed assets 
in addition  because ebitda does not reflect interest expense  it does not take into account the total amount of interest we pay on outstanding debt nor does it show trends in interest costs due to changes in our borrowings or changes in interest rates 
ebitda  as defined by us  may not be comparable to ebitda as reported by other companies that do not define ebitda exactly as we define the term 
because we use ebitda to evaluate our financial performance  we reconcile it to net income loss attributable to red lion hotels corporation  which is the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
ebitda does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income loss or net income loss determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of liquidity

inflation the effect of inflation  as measured by fluctuations in the us consumer price index  has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and ii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we consider a critical accounting policy to be one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  however  we have also identified our most critical accounting policies and estimates below 
management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 

table of contents revenue recognition and receivables revenue is generally recognized as services are provided 
when we receive payment from customers before our services have been performed  the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the service has been completed 
we recognize revenue from the following sources hotels room rental and food and beverage sales from owned and leased hotels 
revenues are recognized when our services have been performed  generally at the time of the hotel stay or guest s visit to the restaurant 
this treatment is consistent with others within our industry

we review the ability to collect individual accounts receivable on a routine basis 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that we believe to be uncollectible and amounts that are past due beyond a certain date 
a receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts if collection attempts fail 
long lived assets property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the assessment of long lived assets for possible impairment requires us to make judgments regarding estimated future cash flows from the respective properties  which is dependent upon internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  the useful life over which our cash flows will occur  the determination of real estate and prevailing market values  asset appraisals and  if available and appropriate  current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers or net sales proceeds from previous  comparable transactions 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets  the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is charged to current earnings 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets as events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
changes to our plans  including a decision to sell  dispose of or change the intended use of an asset  could have a material impact on the carrying value of the asset 
in accordance with the guidance for the impairment of long lived assets  assets held and used with a carrying amount of million were written down to their estimated fair value of million  resulting in a non cash impairment charge of million for the year ended december  the full amount of million was related to the termination of a sublease and franchise agreement with the operator of the red lion hotel sacramento 
during the year ended december   in accordance with the guidance for the impairment of long lived assets  assets held and used with a carrying amount of million were written down to their estimated fair value of million  resulting in a non cash impairment charge of million 
of that amount  million was related to our red lion hotel denver southeast 
the remaining million impairment loss related to a second property 
to determine estimated fair value  we used level inputs for our discounted cash flow analyses  including growth rate  property level preformed financial information and remaining lives of the assets 
management bases these assumptions on historical data and experience and future operational expectations 
for certain assets  we used recent asset appraisals or valuations performed by third parties  which we deemed to be level inputs  to support our estimate of fair value 

table of contents intangible assets our intangible assets include brands and goodwill  which we do not amortize 
instead  we test for impairment annually or more frequently as events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our goodwill and other intangible asset impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  subject to the same general assumptions discussed above for long lived assets 
at december  and  our recorded goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization remained unchanged at million 
while we have not recognized an impairment loss since we originally recorded goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  changes in our estimates and assumptions could affect  potentially materially  our financial condition or results of operations in the future 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts fair value measurement through our company s estimated weighted average cost of capital used to determine discount rate  and through our common stock price that is used to determine market capitalization 
during times of volatility  significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short term move or a longer term trend 
our other intangible assets include marketing and lease contracts  the values of which are amortized on a straight line basis over the weighted average life of the agreements and totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and in accordance with the guidance for the impairment of intangible assets  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the termination of a sublease agreement with the subtenant of the red lion hotel sacramento 
the lease contract intangible asset for that property was deemed fully impaired as of december  due to the termination of that sublease agreement and current market conditions becoming unfavorable to support the carrying value of the lease contract intangible 
the assessment of these contracts requires us to make certain judgments  including estimated future cash flow from the applicable properties 
new and future accounting pronouncements variable interest entities in june  the fasb released accounting standards update asu no 
 improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities issuing changes to the consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities vie 
these changes also amended the guidance governing the determination of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  and is  therefore  required to consolidate an entity  by requiring a qualitative analysis rather than a quantitative analysis 
the qualitative analysis is to include  among other things  consideration of who has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
under the new guidance  we determined that our central program fund cpf now meets the definition of a vie and should be included in our consolidated financial statements 
we adopted these changes retrospectively on january  the cpf acts as an agent for our owned and leased hotels and for our franchisees  and was created to provide services to all member hotels including certain advertising services  frequent guest program administration  reservation services  national sales promotions and brand and revenue management services intended to increase sales and enhance the reputation of the red lion brand 
the activities of the cpf benefit our owned and leased hotels as well as our franchise properties  however  historically only the proportionate share of cpf expense for our owned and leased hotels was recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
based on the new guidance  we will now include all of the expenses and other balances of the cpf in our consolidated financial statements  including revenue received from franchisees to support cpf activities 
there have been no changes to the organization  structure or operating activities of the cpf since its inception in the adoption of these changes were applied retrospectively  including the recording to retained earnings of the million net of tax impact of cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as of january   and the consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to conform to the new treatment 
on january   total assets decreased by million primarily representing the consolidation of accounts receivable  and total liabilities increased million 
the impact of the cpf for the twelve months ended december  and  added additional expense before income tax of million and of  respectively 
the total impact on net loss 
table of contents before income tax for the year ended december  related to the cpf was a negative adjustment of  compared to a positive impact of  for the year ended december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail 
fair value measurements in january  the fasb released asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
we adopted new accounting guidance that requires disclosure of significant transfers between level and level of the fair value hierarchy  the reasons for these transfers and the reasons for any transfers in or out of level of the fair value hierarchy 
in addition  the guidance clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements 
this standard did not have a material impact on the disclosures in our consolidated financial statements 
intangibles goodwill and other in december  the fasb released asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
the update requires a company to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if the carrying value of the reporting unit is zero or negative and adverse qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
the qualitative factors to consider are consistent with the existing guidance which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the requirements in asu are effective for public companies in the first annual period beginning after december  asu is not expected to materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   million of our outstanding debt was subject to currently fixed interest rates and was not exposed to market risk from rate changes 
we also had million outstanding from our revolving credit facility at an interest rate of based on a day libor plus  as well as million outstanding on a five year loan at the prime interest rate of at december  in january we signed an amendment to our credit facility in order to further increase our financial flexibility 
the amendments to the facility  secured by our red lion hotel on fifth avenue property  modified our total leverage ratio and senior leverage ratio covenants for the remaining term of the facility 
we paid an initial fee of  in connection with the amendment and increased the rate on eurodollar borrowings to libor plus  while the interest rate on base rate loans was increased to over the federal funds rate plus or the prime rate  whichever is greater 
the amendment also further reduced borrowing capacity from million to million 
with respect to certain other debt obligations in the aggregate amount of approximately million that are scheduled to mature in  we agreed as to each such obligation that  by june   we will either extend the maturity of the obligation to at least march   repay the obligation in full  or provide the administrative agent with satisfactory evidence that we have arranged for the repayment of the obligation by its scheduled maturity date 
we agreed that  if we sell any capital stock or dispose of or refinance any of our properties  we will apply of the net cash proceeds to prepay the facility  and the commitment under the facility will be reduced by the amount of the prepayment 
in addition to the initial amendment fee  we agreed to pay basis points times the then existing commitment if the facility is still in place on march  and basis points times the then existing commitment if the facility is still in place on june  we also have a variable rate property note secured by our red lion bellevue property and will be secured by our red lion templins property  with a balance of million at december  and due in this note has financial covenants that mirror those of our credit facility  and was also amended in january the interest rate on this note was the prime rate of at december  outside of these changes  we do not foresee any other changes of significance in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  although we will continue to manage our exposure to this risk by monitoring available financing alternatives
