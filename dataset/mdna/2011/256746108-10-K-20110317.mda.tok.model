item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in management s discussion and analysis  we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for our company  including what factors affect our business  what our net sales  earnings  gross margins and costs were in  and  why those net sales  earnings  gross margins and costs were different from the year before  how all of this affects our overall financial condition  what our expenditures for capital projects were in and and what we expect them to be in  and where funds will come from to pay for future expenditures 
as you read management s discussion and analysis  please refer to our consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k  which present the results of operations for the fiscal years ended january   january  and january  in management s discussion and analysis  we analyze and explain the annual changes in some specific line items in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year compared to the comparable fiscal year and the fiscal year compared to the comparable fiscal year key events and recent developments several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations 
you should keep in mind that on november   we completed our acquisition of dollar giant stores  located in the canadian provinces of british columbia  ontario  alberta and saskatchewan 
these stores offer a wide assortment of quality general merchandise  contemporary seasonal goods and everyday consumables  all priced at cad or less 
this is our first expansion of retail operations outside of the united states 
on may   the company s board of directors approved a for stock split in the form of a common stock dividend 
new shares were distributed on june  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on june  as a result  all share and per share data in this form k have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this dividend having the effect of a for stock split 
we assign cost to store inventories using the retail inventory method  determined on a weighted average cost basis 
from our inception and through fiscal  we used one inventory pool for this calculation 
because of our investments over the years in our retail technology systems  we were able to refine our estimate of inventory cost under the retail method and on january   the first day of fiscal  we began using approximately inventory pools in our retail inventory calculation 
as a result of this change  we recorded a non recurring  non cash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory  at cost  of million in the first quarter of this was a prospective change and did not have any effect on prior periods 
on november   we purchased a new distribution center in san bernardino  california 
we have spent approximately million in capital expenditures for this new distribution center during fiscal and an additional million in fiscal this new distribution center replaced our salt lake city  utah leased facility whose lease ended in april on february   we entered into a five year million unsecured credit agreement the agreement 
the agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit  including up to million in available letters of credit  and a million term loan 
the interest rate on the facility is based  at our option  on a libor rate  plus a margin  or an alternate base rate  plus a margin 
overview our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise 
two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends 
first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions 
second  sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next 
we refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales  because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared 
we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales  which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales 
the term expanded also includes stores that are relocated 
at january   we operated  stores in states and the district of columbia  as well as the canadian provinces of british columbia  ontario  alberta and saskatchewan  with million selling square feet compared to  stores with million selling square feet at january  during fiscal  we opened stores  expanded stores  acquired stores and closed stores  compared to new stores opened  stores expanded and stores closed during fiscal in the current year we increased our selling square footage by 
of the million selling square foot increase in  million was added by expanding existing stores and million was added with the acquisition of dollar giant 
the average size of our stores opened in was approximately  selling square feet or about  gross square feet 
for  we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately   selling square feet or about   gross square feet 
we believe that this store size is our optimal size operationally and that this size also gives our customers an ideal shopping environment that invites them to shop longer and buy more 
in fiscal  comparable store net sales increased by 
the comparable store net sales increase was primarily the result of a increase in the number of transactions and a increase in average ticket 
we believe comparable store net sales continued to be positively affected by a number of our initiatives  as debit and credit card penetration continued to increase in  and we continued the roll out of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our stores 
at january  we had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately  stores compared to approximately  stores at january  we believe that the addition of frozen and refrigerated product enables us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers 
in addition  we accept food stamps under the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap in approximately  qualified stores compared to  at the end of with the pressures of the current economic environment  we have seen increases in the demand for basic  consumable products in as a result  we have continued to shift the mix of inventory carried in our stores to more consumer product merchandise which we believe increases the traffic in our stores and has helped to increase our sales even during the current economic downturn 
while this shift in mix has impacted our merchandise costs we were able to offset that impact in the current year with decreased costs for merchandise in many of our categories 
our point of sale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores 
we believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations and increased inventory turnover for each of the last five years 
inventory turnover improved by approximately basis points in in  legislation was enacted that increased the federal minimum wage 
the last increase to an hour was effective in july as a result  our wages have increased in the third quarter of through the first half of  however  we offset the increase in payroll costs through increased productivity and continued efficiencies in product flow to our stores 
we must continue to control our merchandise costs  inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses as increases in these line items could negatively impact our operating results 
results of operations the following table expresses items from our consolidated statements of operations  as a percentage of net sales 
on january    the first day of fiscal  we began using approximately inventory pools in our retail inventory calculation  rather than one inventory pool as we had done since our inception 
as a result of this change  we recorded a non recurring  non cash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory  at cost  of million in the first quarter of year ended year ended year ended january  january  january  net sales cost of sales  excluding non cash beginning inventory adjustment non cash beginning inventory adjustment gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  net sales 
net sales increased  or million  in compared to  resulting from a increase in comparable store net sales and sales in our new stores 
comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores  which we include in the calculation  and  to a lesser extent  are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 
the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended january  and january  january  january  new stores acquired stores expanded or relocated stores closed stores of the million selling square foot increase in approximately million was added by expanding existing stores and million was the result of the acquisition of the dollar giant stores 
gross profit margin was in and excluding the effect of the million non cash beginning inventory adjustment  gross profit margin increased to 
this increase was due to the following occupancy and distribution costs decreased basis points in the current year resulting fromthe leveraging of the comparable store sales increase 
shrink costs decreased basis points due to improved shrink results in the current year and a lower shrink accrual rate during fiscal compared to fiscal merchandise costs  including freight  increased basis points due primarily to higher import and domestic freight costs during fiscal compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to for compared to for the decrease is primarily due to the following payroll expenses decreased basis points fue to leveraging associated with the increase in comparable store net sales in the current year and lower store hourly payroll 
depreciation decreased basis points primarily due to the leveraging associated with the increase in comparable store net sales in current year 
store operating costs decreased basis points primarily as a result of lower utility costs as a percentage of sales  due to lower rates in the current year and the leveraging from the comparable store net sales increase in operating income

gross profit margin increased to in compared to in the increase was due to the following merchandise costs  including inbound freight  decreased basis points due primarily to lower fuel costs and lower ocean freight rates compared to the prior year 
improved initial mark up in many categories during the year was partially offset by an increase in the mix of higher cost consumer product merchandise during fiscal compared to fiscal outbound freight costs decreased basis points in the current year due primarily to decreased fuel costs 
occupancy and distribution costs decreased basis points in the current year resulting from the leveraging of the comparable store sales increase 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to for compared to for the decrease is primarily due to the following depreciation decreased basis points primarily due to the leveraging associated with the increase in comparable store net sales in the current year 
store operating costs decreased basis points primarily as a result of lower utility costs as a percentage of sales  due to lower rates in the current year and the leveraging from the comparable store net sales increase in operating income 
due to the reasons discussed above  operating income margin was in compared to in income taxes 
our effective tax rate was in compared to in the higher rate in the current year was the result of the favorable settlement of several state tax audits in and a higher blended state tax rate in liquidity and capital resources our business requires capital to build and open new stores  expand our distribution network and operate existing stores 
our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in september and october 
historically  we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities 
the following table compares cash flow related information for the years ended january   january  and january  january  january  january  in millions net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased million in compared to due to an increase in cash used to purchase merchandise inventories partially offset by increased earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization in the current year 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million in compared to due to increased earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization in also providing more cash at january  was better inventory management resulting in lower inventory balances per store and higher accounts payable balances due to the timing of payments and increased incentive compensation accruals 
net cash used in investing activities increased million in the current year primarily due to short term investment activity and the dollar giant acquisition 
in we purchased million of short term investments compared to million in this was partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sales of short term investments of million in the current year 
net cash used in investing activities increased million in primarily due to short term investment activity and increased capital expenditures in in we liquidated our short term investments due to market conditions 
the net proceeds from this liquidation of million were put into cash equivalent money market accounts 
in we also purchased million of short term investments 
capital expenditures increased million in primarily due to the purchase of our new distribution center in san bernardino  ca 
in  net cash used in financing activities increased million as a result of increased share repurchases in and repayments of million for debt acquired from dollar giant 
in  net cash used in financing activities increased million as the result of share repurchases in there were no share repurchases in at january   our long term borrowings were million and our capital lease commitments were million 
we also have million and million letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements  under which approximately million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at january  on february   we entered into a five year million unsecured credit agreement the agreement 
the agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit  including up to million in available letters of credit  and a million term loan 
the interest rate on the agreement is based  at our option  on a libor rate  plus a margin  or an alternate base rate  plus a margin 
the revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee  calculated as a percentage  as defined  of the amount available under the line of credit  payable quarterly 
the term loan is due and payable in full at the five year maturity date of the agreement 
the agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually 
the agreement  among other things  requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios  restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness 
as of january   the million term loan is outstanding under the agreement and there were no amounts outstanding under the million revolving line of credit 
we repurchased approximately million shares for approximately million in fiscal we repurchased approximately million shares for approximately million in fiscal less than million of these shares totaling million had not settled as of january  and these amounts were accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of january  we had no share repurchases in fiscal at january   we have approximately million remaining under board authorization 
funding requirements overview we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal to total approximately million  which includes capital expenditures  initial inventory and pre opening costs 
our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal are between and million  including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores and the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately stores 
we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our existing credit facility 
the following tables summarize our material contractual obligations at january   including both on and off balance sheet arrangements  and our commitments  including interest on long term borrowings in millions contractual obligations total thereafter lease financing operating lease obligations capital lease obligations long term borrowings credit agreement revenue bond financing interest on long term borrowings total obligations commitments total expiring in expiring in expiring in expiring in expiring in thereafter letters of credit and surety bonds freight contracts technology assets total commitments lease financing operating lease obligations 
our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases 
the commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to january  for stores that were not yet open on january  long term borrowings credit agreement 
on february   we entered into a five year million unsecured credit agreement the agreement 
the agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit  including up to million in available letters of credit  and a million term loan 
the interest rate on the facility will be based  at our option  on a libor rate  plus a margin  or an alternate base rate  plus a margin 
the interest rate on the facility was at january  the revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee  calculated as a percentage  as defined  of the amount available under the line of credit  payable quarterly 
the term loan is due and payable in full at the five year maturity date of the agreement 
the agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually 
the agreement  among other things  requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios  restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness 
as of january   we had the million term loan outstanding under the agreement and no amounts outstanding under the million revolving line of credit 
revenue bond financing 
in may  we entered into an agreement with the mississippi business finance corporation under which it issued million of variable rate demand revenue bonds 
we used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition  construction and installation of land  buildings  machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in olive branch  mississippi 
at january   the balance outstanding on the bonds was million 
these bonds are due to be fully repaid in june the bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable 
the bonds contain a demand provision and  therefore  outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities 
we pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate  which was at january  interest on long term borrowings 
this amount represents interest payments on the credit agreement and the revenue bond financing using the interest rates for each at january  commitments letters of credit and surety bonds 
we are a party to two letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements  one which provides million for letters of credit and one which provides million for letters of credit 
letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately million of purchases committed under these letters of credit at january  we also have approximately million of letters of credit and million of surety bonds outstanding for our self insurance programs and certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores 
freight contracts 
we have contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts expiring through fiscal the total amount of these commitments is approximately million 
technology assets 
we have commitments totaling approximately million to primarily purchase store technology assets for our stores during derivative financial instruments on march   we entered into two million interest rate swap agreements 
these interest rate swaps are used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our million variable rate term loan 
under these agreements  we pay interest to financial institutions at a fixed rate of 
in exchange  the financial institutions pay us at a variable rate  which approximates the variable rate on the debt  excluding the credit spread 
these swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment and expire in march in  we entered into fuel derivative contracts with third parties which included approximately million gallons of diesel fuel  or approximately of our fuel needs from february through april these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives are included in earnings 
in march  we entered into fuel derivative contracts for approximately million gallons of diesel fuel  or approximately of our fuel needs from august through january critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates 
certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates 
following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical 
inventory valuation as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average basis 
cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted average basis 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
from our inception and through fiscal  we used one inventory pool for this calculation 
because of our investments over the years in our retail technology systems  we were able to refine our estimate of inventory cost under the retail method and on january   the first day of fiscal  we began using approximately inventory pools in our retail inventory calculation 
as a result of this change  we recorded a non recurring  non cash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory  at cost  of approximately million in the first quarter of the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 
inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments  including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink  which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could  under certain circumstances  result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 
we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  quantities of slow moving or seasonal  carryover merchandise on hand  historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans 
the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors  some of which are outside of our control  including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends 
historically  we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results 
our accrual for shrink is based on the actual  historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted  if necessary  for current economic conditions and business trends 
these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger 
our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and september of each year  therefore  the shrink accrual recorded at january  is based on estimated shrink for most of  including the fourth quarter 
we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately basis points in our dollar tree stores for the last few years 
however  we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition 
we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent 
our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis 
accrued expenses on a monthly basis  we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred 
our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses  self insurance costs  store level operating expenses  such as property taxes and utilities  and certain other expenses  such as legal reserves 
our freight and store level operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results 
our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted at least annually based on a review performed by a third party actuary 
these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors 
certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them 
the related accruals are adjusted as management s estimates change 
differences in management estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual 
our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low 
historically  the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our legal proceedings are described in item legal proceedings beginning on page of this form k 
the outcome of litigation  particularly class or collective action lawsuits  is difficult to assess  quantify or predict 
income taxes on a quarterly basis  we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets 
our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates  including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing  applied to the income expected to be taxed currently 
management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management s projections for future taxable income 
we cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years 
historically  we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual 
in addition  we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns 
judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws  including relevant case law  and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and  if so  judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority 
income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded 
we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate
