item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of monarch community bank 
the discussion and analysis does not include any comments relating to monarch community bancorp since monarch community bancorp has no significant operations 
monarch community bancorp  the company  as the sole shareholder of the bank  is a bank holding company 
as a bank holding company  the company is required to register with  and is subject to regulation by  the federal reserve under the bank holding company act  as amended the bhca 
in accordance with federal reserve policy  the company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to the bank and to commit resources to support the bank 
the company  however  has no significant assets other than the bank 
it is typically dependent upon dividends from the bank for revenue 
following monarch community bank s safety and soundness examination  the board of directors of monarch community bank stipulated to the terms of a formal enforcement action consent order with the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the office of financial and insurance regulation for the state of michigan ofir 
the consent order  which was effective may   requires among other things  that the bank obtain the approval of the fdic prior to paying a dividend 
monarch community bancorp s ability to pay dividends  is also currently also prohibited by the written agreement entered into the federal reserve bank of chicago the frb 
for details regarding the written agreement  refer to note in the financial statements 
effective february  the corporation deferred regularly scheduled dividend payments on the million in principal outstanding on its series a fixed rate  cumulative perpetual preferred stock aggregate liquidation preference of million which was issued to the us treasury in february the suspension of dividend payments is permissible under the terms of the tarp capital purchase program  but the dividend is a cumulative dividend and failure to pay dividends for six dividend periods would trigger board of director appointment rights for the holder of the series a preferred stock 
the discussion and analysis does not include any comments relating to monarch community bancorp since monarch community bancorp has no significant operations 
as mentioned in notes and the monarch community bank and monarch community bancorp are restricted from paying dividends without prior consent from respective regulatory agencies 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
monarch s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on loans  investments  and overnight deposits  and interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowings 
monarch s results of operations also are significantly affected by the level of its gains from sales of mortgage loans 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate 
the most significant accounting policies we follow are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
application of these principles requires us to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that require assumptions or judgments to be made based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates 
those policies have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than reported if there is a change to any of the estimates  assumptions  or judgments made by us 
based on the potential impact to the financial statements of the valuation methods  estimates  assumptions  and judgments used  we identified the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses to be the accounting estimate that is the most subjective or judgmental 

table of contents allowance for loan and lease losses a consequence of lending activities is that we may incur losses 
the amount of such losses will vary  depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan and lease portfolio as affected by economic conditions  including rising interest rates  and the financial performance of borrowers 
the allowance for loan and lease losses provides for credit losses inherent in lending and is based on loss estimates derived from a comprehensive quarterly evaluation  reflecting analyses of individual borrowers and historical loss experience  supplemented as necessary by credit judgment to address observed changes in trends  conditions  and other relevant environmental and economic factors 
the allowance provides for probable and estimable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance is increased or decreased through the provisioning process 
there is no exact method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular segments of the loan and lease portfolio 
our determination of the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated loss rates on homogenous portfolios  and deliberation on economic factors and trends 
our estimates of collateral on impaired loans are supported by appraisals when the repayment of principal and interest is unlikely 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the allowance for loan and lease losses 
income taxes we determine our liabilities for income taxes based on current tax regulation and interpretations in tax jurisdictions where our income is subject to taxation 
in estimating income taxes payable or receivable  we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of each tax position 
accordingly  previously estimated liabilities are regularly reevaluated and adjusted  through the provision for income taxes 
changes in the estimate of income taxes payable or receivable occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax law  the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities  and newly enacted statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative merits and risks of each tax position 
these changes  when they occur  affect accrued income taxes and can be significant to our operating results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on income taxes 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future income tax returns  for which a financial statement tax benefit has already been recognized 
the realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable income and the existence of prior years taxable income to which carry back refund claims could be made 
valuation allowances are established against those deferred tax assets determined not likely to be realized 
the valuation allowance may be reversed to income in future periods to the extent that the related deferred tax assets are realized or the valuation allowance is no longer required 
the realization of our deferred tax assets is largely dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income 
the company had a million tax valuation allowance as of december  and million tax valuation allowance as of december  management strategy our primary focus is on increasing market share and profitability by incorporating the mission of making banking fun and easy and by helping our customers retire wealthy 
primary areas of growth will be residential mortgage origination  wealth management and core deposits 
commercial lending will center on loans guaranteed by the us small business administration 
continued emphasis will be placed on  the development of a dynamic customer service and relationship model  the reduction of non performing and classified loans  the prudent reduction of non interest expenses  the implementation of enhanced banking controls  policies and procedures and  the raising of capital sufficient to comply with regulatory requirements 

table of contents changes in financial condition from december  to december  general 
monarch s total assets decreased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  the decline in assets is largely attributable to the decrease in loans which decreased from million at december  to at december  loans 
loans remain our largest category of interest earning assets and the largest source of revenue 
the net loan portfolio decreased million  or 
gross loans decreased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  commercial business loans decreased million in as compared to commercial real estate loans including multi family loans decreased million largely as a result of charge offs in the amount of million 
construction loans decreased by million  which was primarily due to the reclassification of a large relationship in the amount of million to commercial real estate 
residential loans decreased million in  primarily as a result of the migration of one to four family residential loans to the secondary market due to the attractive interest rates available as a result of the decline in interest rates consistent throughout the decline in the residential portfolio is also attributable to the increased level of charge off activity 
the decrease in home equity loans of million from to is also mainly attributable to the refinancing activity seen in the residential market and the declining real estate values 
installment loans or other loans as categorized in note include primarily automobile and recreational vehicle loans 
other loans decreased million in mainly due to normal repayments 
please refer to note to our financial statements for additional information on the composition of our loan portfolio 
credit risk 
credit risk is defined as the risk that borrowers or counter parties will not be able to repay their obligations to us 
credit exposures reflect legally binding commitments for loans  leases  banker s acceptances  standby and commercial letters of credit  and deposit account overdrafts 
our overall credit risk position is reflective of the continued weak economy in  with increased levels of net charge offs  non performing assets and provision for loan and lease losses compared to periods prior to the recession 
loans are carried at an amount which management believes will be collected 
a balance considered not collectible is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
charge offs for loan and lease losses were million for  compared to million for and million for the increase in charge offs in and was primarily due to charge offs related to commercial relationships and an increased level of nonperforming loans related to weaker economic conditions 
we have also seen an increase in charge offs related to one to four family residential mortgages as a result of an increase in foreclosure activity and historically high unemployment rates 
the provision for loan and lease losses was million for  compared to the provision for loan and lease losses of million for and the provision for loan and lease losses of million for the increased provision for loan and lease losses in and was due to the increased level of charge offs and the deterioration in the loan portfolio mainly due to the deterioration in the economy 
nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  and other real estate 
our policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest on loans and leases where principal or interest is past due and remains unpaid for days or more  or when an individual analysis of a borrower s credit worthiness indicates a credit should be placed on nonperforming status  except for residential mortgage loans  which are placed on nonaccrual at the time the loan is placed in foreclosure and consumer loans that are both well secured and in the process of collection 

table of contents nonperforming assets decreased to million as of december  from million as of december   mainly due to decreases in nonaccrual loans 
total nonaccrual loans were million as of december  compared to million as of december  the decrease in nonaccrual loans was primarily due to several large commercial loan relationships returning to an accruing status 
the elevated levels of nonaccrual loans seen during and are largely due to economic stresses being felt in michigan and nationally 
borrowers who normally would be able to fulfill their obligations have been unable to do so in the current environment 
impaired loans are commercial loans for which we believe it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the average investment in impaired loans was million during compared to million during at year end  impaired loans were million compared to million as of december  given the present state of the economy  we have determined that it is necessary to work with some borrowers to reduce potential losses to the bank 
at december   we had million in restructured loans 
million of the restructured loans were in compliance with the terms of agreement or delinquent less than days 
securities 
the bank s securities portfolio decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  securities were of total assets at december  as compared to at december  the decrease was attributable to the sale or maturity of million in securities  which was offset by purchases totaling million 
the bank invested mainly in short term treasuries 
the yield on investment securities has decreased to at december  from for the same period a year ago 
management has slowed further purchasing of securities due to the decline in the current market yield 
with the increase in securities we have continued to maintain a diversified securities portfolio  which includes obligations of us government sponsored agencies  securities issued by states and political subdivisions and mortgage backed securities 
we regularly evaluate asset liability management needs and attempt to maintain a portfolio structure that provides sufficient liquidity and cash flow 
liabilities 
monarch s deposits decreased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  this decrease was primarily in money market accounts which decreased million 
brokered cds decreased million from million at december  to million at december  the bank has attempted to reduce its reliance on brokered and large  out of area cds  although the success of this strategy is dependent on growing core deposits 
retail cd deposits increased million 
other interest bearing checking accounts increased million 
non interest bearing deposit accounts increased million 
the bank expects its non interest bearing deposits to increase in the future as a result of strategies to attract more small business depositors and municipal depositors 
due to the fact that the bank s regulatory capital ratios are less than the levels necessary to be considered well capitalized  it may not obtain new brokered funds as a funding source without prior approval of the fdic and is subject to rate restrictions that limit the amount that can be paid on all types of retail deposits see note for further discussion on the requirements of the consent order 
the maximum rates the bank can pay on all types of retail deposits are limited to the national average rate  plus basis points 
we have compared the bank s current rates with the national rate caps and reduced any rates over the rate cap to fall within those caps 
there has been no material impact to our deposit balances resulting from the rate caps 
federal home loan bank advances decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  we have used brokered certificates of deposit to diversity our sources of funds and improve pricing at certain terms compared to the local market and advances available from federal home loan bank of indianapolis 
for several years our strategy has been to replace borrowed funds and brokered cds with lower costing core deposits 
with the movement of customers from the stock market into more conservative types of investments including deposit products we have been able to take advantage of the shift and significantly reduce our reliance on whole sale funding 
we expect this trend to continue even when customers move back to riskier types of investing due to the retention of staff specifically focused on building and broadening customer relationships 
equity 
total equity amounted to million at december  and million at december   or and  respectively  of total assets at both dates 
the decrease in equity resulted from the net loss for of million and dividend payments of  which consisted of dividends accrued but not paid on the preferred stock

monarch reported a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to net loss of million for the year ended december  and net income of  million in the bank recorded million in goodwill impairment in the explanation of this change is detailed under goodwill in the changes in financial condition section 
the reasons for the change in net income for the years are discussed below 
net interest income 
our primary source of earnings is net interest income  the difference between income on earning assets and the cost of funds supporting those assets 
significant categories of earning assets are loans and securities while deposits and borrowings represent the major portion of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income before provision for loan losses decreased to million for compared to million in  following a decrease from million in net interest margin the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets is affected by movements in interest rates and changes in the mix of earning assets and the liabilities that fund those assets 
our net interest margin has decreased from in to in the decrease from to is 
table of contents primarily due to the declining interest rate environment consistent throughout  and and declining balances on earning assets 
the elevated level of non performing loans has also has a significant impact on the yield generated by the loan portfolio 
interest income 
total interest income in decreased million primarily due to the low interest rates consistent since and the impact of the nonaccrual interest adjustment on nonperforming loans 
this followed a million decrease in compared to which is also attributable to declining interest rates 
in both and the decline in average yield significantly offset the increase in average loans outstanding 
interest expense 
total interest expense decreased million in compared to this followed a decrease of million in compared to the decrease in was primarily the result of a reduction in the rates we paid on deposits  principally reflecting a basis point decrease in the cost of time deposits between the periods  due to continuing low market interest rates 
as a result  our average cost of funds  including the effect of interest free demand deposits  decreased to in from in while the decrease in was also attributable to the declining interest rate environment  the increase in average deposits offset the decrease in average borrowings and the decline in interest rates in compared to the increase in average deposits in and was primarily due to an increase in average money market accounts of million from to in the past the bank has had difficulty in reducing its cost of funds because of increased market rates for cds and further competition for money market deposits which has also resulted in higher rates being paid 
growing lower cost core deposits remains a challenge in our current market area 
our reliance on money market accounts  brokered cds and fhlb borrowings continues to have an impact on our high cost of funds 
provision for loan losses 
the bank recorded a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  compared to million in and million for the same periods in the continued high level of provision for was necessitated by net charge offs of million in and increased loan delinquencies at december  as compared to december  nonperforming assets increased to of assets at december  compared to at december  these levels have increased over the previous two years see selected financial and other data and credit risk 
please refer to note to our financial statements for additional information on our provision for loan losses 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in non interest income increased to million in compared to million for fees and service charges were million for  million for  and million for the decline in fees and service charges is a result of a decline in income for the bounce protection program and loan fees offset by increased income from brokering residential mortgage loans 
income from the bounce protection program has decreased from million in to million in due to decreased customer usage 
future increases in this source of income are dependent on the bank increasing the number of checking account customers 
management does not expect significant increases in bounce protection income from its existing customer base due to the increased regulatory changes that became effective july  income from brokering residential mortgage loans decreased to  in from  in increased to  compared to  in during  the bank developed new mortgage banking relationships with several brokerage companies 
the bank has continued to utilize these companies as a resource for lending opportunities 
the bank does not expect brokered loan income to be a significant source of income in the future 
loan fees have declined from  in to  in due to competitive pressures as well as lower originations of construction and consumer loans 
gain on sale of loans decreased to million in from million in compared to an increase in from  in the increase in was largely due to the falling rate environment which generated a significant amount of one to four family residential mortgage refinancing 
loan servicing income also increased from  in to  in our strategy  which began in  has been to sell as many of the residential mortgage originations as possible to manage the bank s interest rate risk  credit risk and liquidity other income decreased  in compared to primarily due to an impairment charge of  taken against an investment in a low cost housing that provided tax credits 
an increase in gain on the sale of foreclosed assets of  in compared to offset the impairment charge 
other income remained relatively stable in from gain on the sale of foreclosed properties decreased  in compared to these 
table of contents fluctuations in the outcome of the disposition of foreclosed assets were created by changes in the housing market 
the bank does occasionally experience a gain on sale of foreclosed property  as it has become increasingly more conservative in valuing these properties upon acquisition 
management expects to be similar to in terms of foreclosure activity and thus potential gains or losses on subsequent sales of the foreclosed properties 
non interest expense 
non interest expense decreased million in from million in to million in  following an increase of million in compared to the increase in non interest expense in was primarily due to the impairment charge of million on goodwill 
salaries and employee benefits expense decreased to million in as a result of a reduction in force taken in the third quarter in salaries and employee benefits expense increased from slightly from million in to million in as a result of normal increases in salaries and wages 
retaining qualified staff continues to be a priority of management 
repossessed property expense has decreased from  in to  in primarily due to a decrease in impairment charges taken year over year on foreclosed properties 
repossessed property expense has increased from  in to  in due to increased collection and repossession activity as our nonperforming assets increased 
management continues to focus on better management of properties during the holding period  better sales efforts that have led to shorter holding periods and decreased impairment write downs due to better valuation techniques at the time of foreclosure 
professional services expenses increased to  in compared to  in primarily due to increases in legal fees associated with non performing assets 
professional services expenses increased to  in compared to  in primarily due to increases in legal fees associated with non performing loans and with the issuance of preferred stock and common stock warrants as part of the capital purchase program transaction completed in we expect professional services expenses to remain elevated in due to the additional costs associated with working with problem loans 
amortization expense of intangible assets has decreased consistent with the aging of the core deposit intangible established upon the acquisition of msb financial in as indicated in note to the company s financial statements  this expense will continually decline over the remaining life of the related asset 
mortgage banking expense has decreased  to  in compared to  in this was a result of the slowdown in residential mortgage refinancing 
mortgage banking increased  compared to  in this a result of an increase in amortization of mortgage servicing rights as a result of a continued increase in mortgage loan payoffs due to refinancing associated with the decrease of interest rates beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through during  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge 
in the fourth quarter of we updated our goodwill impairment testing 
our common stock price dropped during resulting in a difference between our market capitalization and book value 
the results of the year end goodwill impairment testing showed that the estimated fair value of our bank reporting unit was less than the carrying value of equity 
this necessitated a step analysis and valuation 
based on the step analysis which involved determining the fair value of our bank s assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles we concluded that goodwill was now impaired  resulting in this million charge 
other general and administrative expense has increased to million in from million in  following an increase from million in the increases in  and were largely due to the increase in fdic insurance coverage 
in  the increase in fdic insurance included a  one time special assessment on all insured financial institutions equal to approximately basis points of total assets  less tier one equity  and the quarterly increases implemented during the year 
federal income taxes 
our effective tax rate for purposes of the tax provision was in compared to in and in for  the reduced effective tax rate was the non deductible write off of goodwill and the allowance placed on our deferred tax asset 
in prior years the difference between the effective tax rates and the federal corporate income tax rate of is attributable to the low income housing credits available to the bank from the investment in the limited partnership as well as fluctuation of permanent book and tax differences such as non taxable income and non deductible expenses 

table of contents liquidity and commitments we are required to maintain appropriate levels of liquid assets under fdic regulations 
appropriate levels are determined by our board of directors and management and are included in our asset liability management policy 
liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans 
we have maintained liquidity at levels above those believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations  including new loan funding and potential deposit outflows 
at december   our liquidity ratio  which is our liquid assets as a percentage of total deposits less certificates of deposit maturing in more than one year and plus borrowings maturing in one year or less  was 
this level of liquidity is higher than that maintained last year 
management has taken steps to increase liquidity and is confident it will be able to effectively address the bank s liquidity needs 
monarch s liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents  is a product of our operating  investing and financing activities 
monarch s primary sources of funds are deposits  amortization  prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans  overnight deposits and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and overnight deposits are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
monarch also generates cash through borrowings 
monarch utilizes federal home loan bank advances to leverage its capital base and provide funds for its lending and investment activities  and to enhance its interest rate risk management 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
excess liquidity is generally invested in overnight deposits  including fed funds  and short term treasury and governmental agency securities 
on a longer term basis  monarch maintains a strategy of investing in various investments and lending products 
monarch uses its sources of funds primarily to meet its ongoing commitments  to pay maturing certificates of deposit and savings withdrawals and to fund loan commitments 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at december   totaled million 
based on historical experience  management believes that a significant portion of these certificates of deposit can be retained by continuing to pay competitive interest rates 
if necessary  additional funding sources include additional deposits including core deposits and federal home loan bank advances 
based on current collateral levels  at december   monarch could borrow an additional million from the federal home loan bank at prevailing interest rates 
we anticipate we will continue to have sufficient funds  through deposits and borrowings  to meet our current commitments 
for the year ended december   monarch had a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to a net decrease of million for the year ended december  the company s primary sources of funds during were operations of million  proceeds from the sale and maturities of securities of million  and million in principal loan collections in excess of loan originations the primary uses of funds in were the repayment of million of fhlb advances and purchases of securities of million and a decrease in deposits of million 
the company s primary sources of funds during were operations of million  increase in deposits of million and million increase generated by the issuance of preferred stock 
the primary uses of cash in were the repayment of million of fhlb advances and purchase of securities of million 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   the total unused commercial and consumer lines of credit were million and there were outstanding commitments under letters of credit of  at december   the total unused commercial and consumer lines of credit were million and there were outstanding commitments under letters of credit of  the company has no arrangements with any other entities that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on

see also regulatory orders below 
impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
our primary assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates  however  do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the price of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation 
in a period of rapidly rising interest rates  the liquidity and maturity structures of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
the principal effect of inflation  as distinct from levels of interest rates  on earnings is in the area of non interest expense 
such expense items as employee compensation  employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation 
an additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in the dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made 
we are unable to determine the extent  if any  to which properties securing our loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management and market risk our risk when interest rates change 
the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk 
how we measure our risk of interest rate changes 
as part of our attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor our interest rate risk 
in monitoring interest rate risk  we continually analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates  the timing of their maturities  and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 

table of contents the board of directors sets and recommends the asset and liability policies of the bank which are implemented by the asset and liability management committee 
the asset and liability management committee is comprised of members of our senior management 
the purpose of the asset and liability management committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with our business plan and board approved policies 
the asset and liability management committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the asset and liability management committee generally meets on a quarterly basis to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital position  anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and interest rate risk exposure limits versus current projections 
the chief financial officer is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementation and strategies to the board of directors  each quarter 
in order to manage our assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  we have focused our strategies on originating shorter term commercial real estate loans for retention in our portfolio  selling a significant portion of the long term  fixed rate residential mortgage loans we make  managing our deposits to establish stable deposit relationships with an emphasis on core  non certificate deposits  supplementing these with brokered deposits  as appropriate  and maintaining longer term borrowings at fixed interest rates to offset the negative impact of longer term fixed rate loans in our loan portfolio 
future borrowings are expected to be short term to reduce the average maturity of our borrowings 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  the asset and liability management committee may determine to increase monarch s interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain the net interest margin 
in addition  in an effort to manage our interest rate risk and liquidity  in and we sold million and million  respectively  of fixed rate  one to four family mortgage loans in the secondary market 
we expect to continue to sell a significant portion of our originated long term  fixed rate  one to four family loans but may retain some portion of our year and shorter  fixed rate loans 
monarch uses an internally generated model that uses scenario analysis to evaluate the irr exposure of the bank by estimating the sensitivity of the bank s portfolios of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts to changes in market interest rates 
the information presented in the following table presents the expected change in monarch s net portfolio value at december  that would occur upon an immediate change in interest rates

table of contents assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
based on the data from the model  management believes that the bank s irr level remains minimal 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  if interest rates change  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
the bank  like other financial institutions  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
our net interest margin can change  either positively or negatively  as the result of increases or decreases in market interest rates 
some factors affecting net interest margin are outside of our control  market interest rates are but one factor affecting the bank s net interest margin 
however  management has the ability  through its asset liability management and pricing policies to affect the bank s net interest margin notwithstanding the level of market interest rates 
the preceding table indicates the bank s net portfolio value will decrease in an increasing interest rate scenario and increase in a decreasing interest rate scenario 
management believes that its net interest margin will behave similarly 
if rising interest rates stifle loan demand or create additional competitive pressures in attracting and retaining deposits  the bank s desire for growth in total assets may cause management to alter its strategy that could negatively impact the net interest margin 
the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes  as well as the sector affected short term vs 
long term will have an impact on the bank s net interest margin 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes to interest rates as of december  the company had no derivative instruments  or trading portfolio as of that date 
the expected maturity date values for loans receivable  mortgage backed securities and investment securities were calculated without adjusting the contractual maturity dates for expectations of repayments 
expected maturity date values for non maturity  interest bearing deposits were based on the opportunity for repricing
