item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to those statements included in item of this form k 
the discussion may contain certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements are those that are not historical in nature 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under risk factors in this form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements 
executive summary we are a specialty finance company that acquires  manages  and finances  directly or through our subsidiaries  commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate debt  commercial mortgage backed securities  or cmbs  and other commercial real estate related assets 
we expect that the commercial real estate loans we acquire will be fixed and floating rate first mortgage loans secured by commercial properties 
we may also acquire subordinated commercial mortgage loans and mezzanine loans 
we intend to acquire cmbs which are rated aaa through bbb as well as cmbs that are below investment grade or are non rated 
the other commercial real estate related securities and other commercial real estate asset classes will consist of commercial real property  debt and equity tranches of commercial re al estate collateralized debt obligations  or cre cdos  loans to real estate companies including real estate investment trusts  or reits  and real estate operating companies  or reocs  commercial real estate securities and commercial real property 
in addition  we expect to acquire residential mortgage backed securities  or rmbs  for which a us government agency such as the government national mortgage association  or ginnie mae  or a federally chartered corporation such as the federal national mortgage association  or fannie mae  or the federal home loan mortgage corporation  or freddie mac  guarantees payments of principal and interest on the securities 
we refer to these securities as agency rmbs 
we refer to ginnie mae  fannie mae  and freddie mac collectively as the agencies 
we are externally managed by fixed income discount advisory company  which we refer to as fidac or our manager 
we qualified to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ending on december  our targeted asset classes and the principal investments we expect to make in each are as follows commercial real estate loans  consisting of o first mortgage loans that are secured by commercial and multifamily properties o subordinated mortgage loans or b notes o mezzanine loans o construction loans commercial mortgage backed securities  or cmbs  consisting of o cmbs rated aaa through bbb o cmbs that are rated below investment grade or are non rated other commercial real estate assets  consisting of o commercial property o preferred equity investments o debt and equity tranches of cre cdos o loans to real estate companies including reits and reocs o commercial real estate securities agency rmbs o single family residential mortgage pass through certificates representing interests in pools of mortgage loans secured by residential real property where payments of both interest and principal are guaranteed by a us government agency or federally chartered corporation we completed our initial public offering on september  in that offering and in a concurrent private offering we raised net proceeds of approximately million 
our objective is to provide attractive risk adjusted returns to our investors over the long term  primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation 
we intend to achieve this objective by investing in a broad range of commercial real estate related assets to construct a portfolio that is designed to achieve attractive risk adjusted returns and that is structured to comply with the various federal income tax requirements for reit status and to maintain our exemption from the act 
since we commenced operations in september  we have focused our investing activities on acquiring cmbs and commercial real estate loans that generate stable cash flows and provide long term  attractive risk adjusted returns to our investors 
sources for our investments include a variety of originators  such as investment banks and insurance companies 
we have also acquired investments in the secondary market through either competitive bids or negotiated transactions 
we also co invested with third parties to diversify our portfolio 
our investment strategy is intended to take advantage of opportunities in the current interest rate and credit environment 
we will adjust our strategy to changing market conditions by shifting our asset allocations across these various asset classes as interest rate and credit cycles change over time 
we believe that our strategy  combined with fidac s experience  will enable us to pay dividends and achieve capital appreciation throughout changing market cycles 
we expect to take a long term view of assets and liabilities  and our reported earnings and mark to market valuations at the end of a financial reporting period will not significantly impact our objective of providing attractive risk adjusted returns to our stockholders over the long term 
we have financed our current cmbs portfolio with non recourse financings under the term asset backed securities loan facility  or the talf 
based on market conditions  we intend to utilize structural leverage through securitizations of commercial real estate loans or cmbs 
with regard to leverage available under the talf  the maximum level of allowable leverage under currently announced cmbs programs would be with regard to securitizations  the leverage will depend on the market conditions for structuring such transactions 
we will seek to finance the acquisition of agency rmbs using repurchase agreements with counterparties  which are recourse 
we anticipate that leverage for agency rmbs would be available to us  which we expect would allow for debt to equity ratio in the range of to but would likely not exceed based on current market conditions  we expect to operate within the leverage levels described above in the near and long term 
we are not required to maintain any specific debt to equity ratio  as we believe the level of leverage will vary based on the particular asset class  the characteristics of the portfolio and market conditions 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing as described herein 
if we finance all or a portion of our portfolio  subject to maintaining our qualification as a reit  we may utilize derivative financial instruments  including  among others  interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  and interest rate floors to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk 
specifically  we may seek to hedge our exposure to potential interest rate mismatches between the interest we earn on our assets and our borrowing costs caused by fluctuations in short term interest rates 
in utilizing leverage and interest rate hedges  our objectives will be to improve risk adjusted returns and  where possible  to lock in  on a long term basis  a spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of our financing 
current environment we believe that the current market environment presents a compelling opportunity to achieve attractive risk adjusted returns in commercial real estate investments 
we estimate that from to  over trillion of commercial real estate loans are scheduled to mature and that markets are likely to face a void of several hundred billion dollars over this period that must be filled by new mortgage lenders since the supply of debt from traditional lending sources is anticipated to be less than the volume necessary to refinance maturing real estate loans 
the volume of issuances of newly created cmbs dropped from billion in to billion in and was recorded at billion for year to date through december this decline has had a concomitant impact on the supply of capit al for new commercial mortgage lending since the net proceeds from newly created cmbs issuances are applied to purchase commercial mortgage loans from loan originators 
factors impacting our operating results in addition to the prevailing market conditions  we expect that the results of our operations will be affected by a number of factors and will primarily depend on  among other things  the level of our net interest income  the market value of our assets and the supply of  and demand for  commercial mortgage loans  commercial real estate debt  cmbs and other financial assets in the marketplace 
our net interest income includes the actual payments we receive and is also impacted by the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts 
our net interest income varies over time  primarily as a result of changes in interest rates  and  to the extent we invest in rmbs  prepayment rates as measured by the constant prepayment rate  or cpr  on our rmbs assets 
interest rates and prepayment rates vary according to the type of as set  conditions in the financial markets  credit worthiness of our borrowers  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
our operating results may also be impacted by credit losses in excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers whose mortgage loans are held directly by us or are included in our cmbs 
change in fair value of our assets 
it is our business strategy to hold our targeted assets as long term investments 
as such  we expect that the majority of our assets will be carried at their fair value  as available for sale securities in accordance with asc  investments in debt and equity securities  with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity  rather than through earnings 
as a result  we do not expect that changes in the fair value of the assets will normally impact our operating results 
at least on a quarterly basis  however  we will assess both our ability and intent to continue to hold such assets as long term inv estments 
as part of this process  we will monitor our targeted assets for other than temporary impairment  or otti 
a change in our ability or intent to continue to hold any of our investment securities or a change in our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis could result in our recognizing an impairment charge or realizing losses upon the sale of such securities 
credit risk 
we may be exposed to various levels of credit risk depending on the nature of our underlying assets and the nature and level of credit enhancements  if any  supporting our assets 
fidac and fidac s investment committee will approve and monitor credit risk and other risks associated with each investment 
we will seek to manage this risk through our pre acquisition due diligence processes including  but not limited to  analysis of the sponsor borrower  the structure of the investment  property information including tenant composition  the property s historical operating performance and evaluation of the market in which the property is located 
size of portfolio 
the size of our portfolio  as measured by the aggregate unpaid principal balance of our mortgage loans and aggregate principal balance of our mortgage related securities and the other assets we own is also a key revenue driver 
generally  as the size of our portfolio grows  the amount of interest income we receive increases 
the larger portfolio  however  drives increased expenses as we incur additional interest expense to finance the purchase of our assets 
changes in market interest rates 
with respect to our business operations  increases in interest rates  in general  may over time cause the interest expense associated with our borrowings to increase  the value of our mortgage loans  cmbs and any rmbs we may acquire to decline  coupons on our adjustable rate mortgage loans  cmbs and any rmbs we may acquire to reset  although on a delayed basis  to higher interest rates  to the extent applicable under the terms of our investments  prepayments on our mortgage loan portfolio and any rmbs we may acquire to slow  thereby slowing the amortization of our purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts  and to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy  the value of these agreements to increase 
conversely  decreases in interest rates  in general  may over time cause the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease  the value of our mortgage loan  cmbs and any rmbs we may acquire to increase  coupons on our adjustable rate mortgage loans  cmbs and any rmbs we may acquire to reset  although on a delayed basis  to lower interest rates to the extent applicable under the terms of our investments  prepayments on our mortgage loans  and any rmbs we may acquire to increase  thereby accelerating the amortization of our purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts  to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy  the value of these agreements to decrease  and since changes in interest rates may significantly affect our activities  our operating results depend  in large part  upon our ability to effectively manage interest rate risks and prepayment risks while maintaining our status as a reit 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
these accounting principles may require us to make some complex and subjective decisions and assessments 
our most critical accounting policies will involve decisions and assessments that could affect our reported assets and liabilities  as well as our reported revenues and expenses 
we believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our consolidated financial statements are based will be reasonable at the time made and based upon information available to us at that time 
the following are or will be our most critical accounting policies loans and securities held for investment we purchase cmbs  commercial real estate loans  and commercial real estate related securities  a portion of which may be held for investment 
loans or securities held for investment are intended to be held to maturity and  accordingly  will be reported at amortized cost less an allowance for loan losses 
securities held as available for sale a portion of our cmbs and commercial real estate related securities may be held as available for sale 
in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  investments debt and equity securities  all assets classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  and unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income 
we analyze assets for impairment and any credit impairment is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
valuation of financial instruments asc  fair value measurements and disclosure  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands related disclosures 
this guidance establishes a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the observability of inputs utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair values 
it also establishes market based or observable inputs as the preferred source of values  followed by valuation models using management assumptions in the absence of market inputs 
the three levels of the hierarchy are described below level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level prices are determined using other significant observable inputs 
observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in pricing a security 
these may include quoted prices for similar securities  interest rates  prepayment speeds  credit risk and others 
level prices are determined using significant unobservable inputs 
in situations where quoted prices or observable inputs are unavailable for example  when there is little or no market activity for an investment at the end of the period  unobservable inputs may be used 
unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions about the factors that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability  and would be based on the best information available 
we anticipate that a portion of our future asset purchases may be classified as level in the valuation hierarchy 
fasb has provided guidance for the valuation of assets when the market is not active and when the volume and level of activity have significantly decreased  along with guidance on identifying transactions that are not orderly 
this guidance allows the use of management s internal cash flow and discount rate assumptions when relevant observable data does not exist and clarifies how observable market information and market quotes should be considered when measuring fair value in an inactive market 
additionally  fasb provided guidance on determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased when compared with normal market activity for the asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities 
this guidance provides factors to evaluate if there has been a decrease in normal market activity and if so  provides a methodology to analyze transactions or quoted prices and make necessary adjustments to fair value 
the objective is to determine the point within a range of fair value estimates that is most representative of fair value under current market conditions 
fidac determines the value of our securities on a quarterly basis using third party pricing models and its proprietary models 
fidac receives independent dealer quotes for each of its securities  and compares these quotes to evaluate the reasonableness of the fidac determined values 
any changes to the valuation methodology will be reviewed by management to ensure the changes are appropriate 
as markets and products develop and the pricing for certain products becomes more transparent  we will continue to refine our valuation methodologies 
the methods used by us may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values 
furthermore  while we anticipate that our valuation methods will be appropriate and consistent with other market participants  the use of diffe rent methodologies  or assumptions  to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 
we will use inputs that are current as of the measurement date  which may include periods of market dislocation  during which price transparency may be reduced 
loan impairment loans held for investment are valued quarterly to determine if an impairment exists 
impairment occurs when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
if upon completion of the valuation  the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the impaired loan is less than the net carrying value of the loan  an allowance will be created with a corresponding charge to the provision for losses 
an allowance for each loan is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses 
we may elect to sell a loan held for investment due to adverse changes in credit fundamentals 
once the determination has been made by us that we will no longer hold the loan for investment  we will account for the loan at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value 
the reclassification of the loan and recognition of impairments could adversely affect our reported earnings 
impairment of securities securities are valued quarterly to determine if otti exists 
impairment occurs when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost basis 
the securities are evaluated based on the intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
if the intention is not to sell and we are not required to sell  the credit loss  if any  will be recognized in the statement of earnings and the balance of impairment related to other factors recognized in other comprehensive income  or oci 
credit loss is determined by comparing the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis 
if the intention is to sell the security or we are required to sell before its anticipat ed recovery  the full otti will be recognized in the statement of earnings 
the recognition of impairments could adversely affect our reported earnings 
classifications of investment securities we expect our assets to consist primarily of commercial real estate debt instruments  cmbs and agency rmbs that we will classify as either available for sale or held to maturity 
as such  our assets are classified as available for sale will be carried at their fair value in accordance with asc  with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity  rather than through earnings 
assets held for investment will be stated at their amortized cost  net of deferred fees and costs with income recognized using the effective interest method 
when the estimated fair value of an available for sale security is less than amortized cost  we will consider whether there is otti in the value of the security 
unrealized losses on securities considered to be other than temporary will be recognized in earnings 
the determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired will involve judgments and assumptions based on subjective and objective factors 
consideration will be given to i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of recovery in fair value of the security and iii our intent to sell our investment in the security  or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery in fair value 
investments with unrealized losses will not be considered other than temporarily impaired if we have the ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time  to maturity if necessary  sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the amortized cost of the investments 
investment consolidation when acquiring assets  we evaluate the underlying entity that issued the securities we intend to acquire  or to which we will make a loan to determine the appropriate accounting 
we refer  initially  to guidance in asc transfers and servicing and asc  consolidation  in performing our analysis 
asc addresses consolidation of certain entities in which voting rights are not effective in identifying an investor with a controlling financial interest 
an entity is subject to consolidation analysis under this guidance if it is determined that the entity is a variable interest entity  or vie 
in a vie  the investors either do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additio nal subordinated financial support  are unable to direct the entity s activities  or are not exposed to the entity s losses or entitled to its residual returns proportional to their ownership 
variable interest entities within the scope of this guidance are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a vie has a controlling interest in the vie 
the assessment of controlling interest shall consider the vies purpose and design 
a controlling interest is defined as a the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie and or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
the exemption for a qualifying special purpose entity or qspe was eliminated by the january  update to this guidance and implemented ongoing analysis to assess the primary beneficiary 
currently  this guidance has no material effect on our consolidated financial statements as we hold no interest in any qspe s or vie s at this time 
securitizations we may periodically enter into transactions in which we sell financial assets  such as commercial mortgage loans  cmbs and other assets 
upon a transfer of financial assets  we will sometimes retain or acquire senior or subordinated interests in the related assets 
gains and losses on such transactions will be recognized using the guidance in asc transfers and servicing  which is based on a financial components approach that focuses on control 
under this approach  after a transfer of financial assets that meets the criteria for treatment as a sale legal isolation  ability of transferee to pledge or exchange the transferred assets without constraint  and transferred control an entity recognizes the financial and servicing assets it acquired or retained and the liabilities it has incurred  derecognizes financial assets it has sold  and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished 
we will determine the gain or loss on sale of mortgage loans by allocating the carrying value of the underlying mortgage between securities or loans sold and the interests retained based on their fair values 
the gain or loss on sale is the difference between the cash proceeds from the sale and the amount allocated to the securities or loans sold 
from time to time  we may securitize mortgage loans we hold if such financing is available 
these transactions will be recorded in accordance with asc and will be accounted for as either a sale and the loans will be removed from our balance sheet or as a financing and will be classified as securitized loans on our balance sheet  depending upon the structure of the securitization transaction 
valuations of available for sale securities our available for sale securities have fair values as determined by fidac with reference to price estimates provided by independent pricing services and dealers in the securities 
fidac will evaluate available for sale securities estimates by conducting its own analysis at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such evaluation 
the pricing is subject to various assumptions which could result in different presentations of value 
when the fair value of an available for sale security is less than its amortized cost for an extended period  we will consider whether there is otti in the value of the security 
if  based on our analysis  a credit portion of otti exists  the cost basis of the security is written down to the then current fair value  and the unrealized loss is transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of current earnings as if the loss had been realized in the period of otti 
the determination of otti is a subjective process  and different judgments and assumptions could affect the timing of loss realization 
we will consider the following factors when determining otti for a security or investment the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than the amortized cost  whether the security has been downgraded by a rating agency  and whether we have the intent to sell the security or will be required to sell the security before any anticipated recovery in market value to amortized cost 
the determination of otti is made at least quarterly 
if we determine an impairment to be other than temporary we will need to realize a loss that would have an impact on future income 
interest income recognition interest income on available for sale securities and loans held for investment will be recognized over the life of the investment using the effective interest method 
interest income on mortgage backed securities is recognized using the effective interest method 
interest income on loans held for investment is recognized based on the contractual terms of the loan instruments 
income recognition will be suspended for loans when  in the opinion of management  a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful 
income recognition will be resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed 
any loan fees or acquisition costs on originated loans or securities will be capitalized and recognized as a component of interest income over the life of the investment using the e ffective interest method 
management estimates  at the time of purchase  the future expected cash flows and determine the effective interest rate based on these estimated cash flows and our purchase price 
as needed  these estimated cash flows will be updated and a revised yield computed based on the current amortized cost of the investment 
in estimating these cash flows  there will be a number of assumptions that will be subject to uncertainties and contingencies 
these include the rate and timing of principal payments including prepayments  repurchases  defaults and liquidations  the pass through or coupon rate and interest rate fluctuations 
in addition  interest payment shortfalls due to delinquencies on the underlying mortgage loans  and the timing of the magnitude of credit losses on the mortgage loans underlying the securities have to be judgmentally es timated 
these uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may impact management s estimates and our interest income 
security transactions will be recorded on the trade date 
realized gains and losses from security transactions will be determined based upon the specific identification method and recorded as gain loss on sale of available for sale securities and loans held for investment in the consolidated statement of operations 
we account for accretion of discounts or amortization of premiums on available for sale securities and real estate loans using the effective interest method 
such amounts will be included as a component of interest income in the consolidated statement of operations 
accounting for derivative financial instruments our policies permit us to enter into derivative contracts  including interest rate swaps and interest rate caps  as a means of mitigating our interest rate risk 
we intend to use interest rate derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risk rather than to enhance returns 
we will account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with asc  derivatives and hedging 
asc requires us to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial condition and to measure those instruments at fair value 
additionally  fair value adjustments will affect either other comprehensive income in stockholders equity until the hedged item is recognized in earnings or net income depending on whether the derivative instrument qualifies as a hedge for accounting purposes and  if so  the nature of the hedging activity 
in the normal course of business  we may use a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risk 
when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified  or when the underlying hedged item ceases to exist  all changes in the fair value of the instrument are marked to market with changes in value included in net income for each period until the derivative instrument matures or is settled 
any derivative instrument used for risk management that does not meet the hedging criteria is marked to market with the changes in value included in net income 
qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives  quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments  and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in der ivative agreements shall be included in future financial reporting 
derivatives will be used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
we will rely on quotations from a third party to determine their fair values 
fidac will evaluate the quotations provided by third parties by conducting its own analysis at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such evaluation 
if our hedging activities do not achieve our desired results  our reported earnings may be adversely affected 
reserve for probable credit losses the expense for possible credit losses in connection with debt investments is the charge to earnings to increase the allowance for possible credit losses to the level that management estimates to be adequate considering delinquencies  loss experience and collateral quality 
other factors considered relate to geographic trends and product diversification  the size of the portfolio and current economic conditions 
based upon these factors  we will establish the provision for possible credit losses by category of asset 
when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts contractually due  the account is considered impaired 
where impairment is indicated  a valuation write down or write off is measured based upon the excess of the recorded investment amount over the net fair value of the collateral  as reduced by selling costs 
any deficiency between the carrying amount of an asset and the net sales price of repossessed collateral is charged to the allowance for credit losses 
income taxes we have elected and are qualified to be taxed as a reit beginning with our taxable year ending on december  accordingly  we will generally not be subject to us federal income tax or applicable state or local taxes to the extent that we make qualifying distributions to our stockholders  and provided we satisfy on a continuing basis  through actual investment and operating results  the reit requirements including certain asset  income  distribution and stock ownership tests 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions  we will be subject to us federal income tax and applicable state and local taxes and may be precluded from qualifying as a reit for the subsequent four taxable years following the year in which we lost our reit qualification 
accordingly  our failure to qualify as a reit could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders 
the dividends paid deduction of a reit for qualifying dividends to its stockholders is computed using our taxable income as opposed to net income reported on the financial statements 
taxable income  generally  will differ from net income reported on the financial statements because the determination of taxable income is based on tax provisions and not financial accounting principles 
we may elect to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries trs 
in general  a trs may hold assets and engage in activities that a reit cannot hold or engage in directly and generally may engage in any real estate or non real estate related business 
a domestic trs is subject to us federal income tax and applicable state and local taxes 
we presently have not elected trs status for any of our subsidiaries 
should we establish a trs  as such entity generated net income  it could declare dividends to us which would be included in our taxable income and necessitate a distribution to our stockholders 
conversely  to avoid a distribution requirement  the trs could retain its earnings and we would increase book equity of the consolidated entity by the amount of the retained earnings

liquidity and capital resources liquidity measures our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund and maintain our assets and operations  make distributions to our stockholders and other general business needs 
we will use significant cash to purchase our targeted assets  repay principal and interest on our borrowings  make distributions to our stockholders and fund our operations 
our primary sources of cash will generally consist of the net proceeds equity offerings  payments of principal and interest we receive on our portfolio of assets  cash generated from our operating results and unused borrowing capacity under our financing sources 
we have financed our cmbs portfolio with non recourse financings under the talf  and based on market conditions we intend to utilize structural leverage through securitizations of commercial real estate loans or cmbs 
we will  however  also seek to finance the acquisition of agency rmbs using repurchase agreements with counterparties  which are recourse 
with regard to leverage available under the talf  the maximum level of allowable leverage under currently announced cmbs programs would be if we are unable to obtain financing through us government programs  then we will either utilize other non recourse or recourse financing sources  invest in these asset classes on an unlevered basis or we will not invest in these asset classes 
with regard to securitizations  the leverage will depend on the market condit ions for structuring such transactions 
we anticipate that leverage for agency rmbs would be available to us  which would provide for a debt to equity ratio in the range of to but would likely not exceed based on current market conditions  we expect to operate within the leverage levels described above in the near and long term 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms  or not at all 
securitizations we intend to seek to enhance the returns on our commercial mortgage loan investments  especially loan acquisitions  through securitization 
if available  we intend to securitize the senior portion  expected to be equivalent to aaa rated cmbs  while retaining the subordinate securities in our portfolio 
other sources of financing we expect to use repurchase agreements to finance acquisitions of agency rmbs with a number of counterparties 
in the future  we may also use other sources of financing to fund the acquisition of our targeted assets  including warehouse facilities and other secured and unsecured forms of borrowing 
we may also seek to raise further equity capital or issue debt securities in order to fund our future asset acquisitions 
for our short term one year or less and long term liquidity  which include investing and compliance with collateralization requirements under our repurchase agreements if the pledged collateral decreases in value or in the event of margin calls created by prepayments of the pledged collateral  we also rely on the cash flow from investments  primarily monthly principal and interest payments to be received on our cmbs and mortgage loans  cash flow from the sale of securities as well as any primary securities offerings authorized by our board of directors 
based on our current portfolio  leverage ratio and available borrowing arrangements  we believe our assets will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated short term one year or less liquidity requirements such as to fund our investment activities  pay fees under our management agreement  fund our distributions to stockholders and pay general corporate expenses 
however  a decline in the value of our collateral or an increase in prepayment rates substantially above our expectations could cause a temporary liquidity shortfall due to the timing of the necessary margin calls on the financing arrangements and the actual receipt of the cash related to principal paydowns 
if our cash resources are at any time insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may have to sell debt or additional equity securities in a common stock off ering 
if required  the sale of cmbs or mortgage loans at prices lower than their carrying value would result in losses and reduced income 
our ability to meet our long term greater than one year liquidity and capital resource requirements will be subject to obtaining additional debt financing and equity capital 
subject to our maintaining our qualification as a reit  we expect to use a number of sources to finance our investments  including repurchase agreements  warehouse facilities  securitization  commercial paper and term financing cdos 
such financing will depend on market conditions for capital raises and for the investment of any proceeds 
if we are unable to renew  replace or expand our sources of financing on substantially similar terms  it may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
upon liquidation  holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of o ur available assets prior to the holders of our common stock 
we held cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
our operating activities provided net cash of approximately million for the year ended december  and proceeds of  for the period september  to december  our investing activities used net cash of million and million for the year ended december  and the period commencing september  through december   respectively  primarily for the purchase of investments 
our financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of net proceeds of million from our secured financing agreement with the frbny 
our financing activities for the period ended december  consisted of net proceeds from our september initial offering in which we raised approximately million and secured financing agreement with the frbny 
we currently have established uncommitted repurchase agreements for rmbs we may acquire with counterparties 
at december  and december   our financing agreements had the following remaining maturities december  december  dollars in thousands overnight days to days to days to days greater than or equal to days   total we are not required to maintain any specific debt to equity ratio as we believe the appropriate leverage for the particular assets we are financing depends on the credit quality and risk of those assets 
at december  our total debt was approximately million which represented a debt to equity ratio of approximately as compared to december  our total debt was approximately million which represented a debt to equity ratio of approximately stockholders equity our charter provides that we may issue up to  shares of stock  consisting of up to  shares of common stock having a par value of per share and up to  shares of preferred stock having a par value of per share 
on september   we announced the sale of  shares of common stock at per share for estimated proceeds  less the underwriters discount and offering expenses  of million 
concurrently with the sale of these shares annaly purchased  shares at the same price per share as the public offering  for proceeds of approximately million 
these sales were completed on september  in all  we raised net proceeds of approximately million in these offerings 
on september   we issued  shares of restricted common stock in accordance to the equity incentive plan to our independent directors  which vested immediately 
there was no preferred stock issued or outstanding as of december  related party transactions management agreement on august   we entered into a management agreement with fidac and subsequently amended on september   pursuant to which fidac is entitled to receive a management fee and  in certain circumstances  a termination fee and reimbursement of certain expenses as described in the management agreement 
such fees and expenses do not have fixed and determinable payments 
the management fee is payable quarterly in arrears in an amount equal to per annum for the first twelve months of operations  per annum for the period after the first twelve months through the eighteenth month of operations  and per annum after the first eighteen months of operations  calculated quarterly  of our stockholders equity as defined in the management agreement 
fidac uses the proceeds from its ma nagement fee in part to pay compensation to its officers and employees who  notwithstanding that certain of them also are our officers  receive no cash compensation directly from us 
upon termination without cause  we will pay fidac a termination fee 
we may also terminate the management agreement with days prior notice from our board of directors  without payment of a termination fee  for cause or upon a change of control of annaly or fidac  each as defined in the management agreement 
fidac may terminate the management agreement if we or any of our subsidiaries become required to register as an investment company under the act  with such termination deemed to occur immediately before such event  in which case we would not be required to pay a termination fee 
fidac may also decline to renew the management agreement by providing us with days written notice  in which case we would not be required to pay a termination fee 
we are obligated to reimburse fidac for its costs incurred under the management agreement 
in addition  the management agreement permits fidac to require us to pay for our pro rata portion of rent  telephone  utilities  office furniture  equipment  machinery and other office  internal and overhead expenses of fidac incurred in our operation 
these expenses are allocated between fidac and us based on the ratio of our proportion of gross assets compared to all remaining gross assets managed by fidac as calculated at each quarter end 
we and fidac will modify this allocation methodology  subject to our board of directors approval if the allocation becomes inequitable ie  if we become very highly leveraged compared to fidac s other funds and accounts 
fidac has waived its right to request reimbursemen t from us of these expenses until such time as it determines to rescind that waiver 
purchases of common stock by affiliates on september  we sold annaly  shares at the same price per share paid by other investors in our public offering and annaly owns of our outstanding shares of common stock 
on may   we issued  shares of our common stock to certain of fidac s officers and employees for an aggregate purchase price of  on september   we repurchased  shares of common stock from those holders on a pro rata basis at the initial per share purchase price 
restricted stock grants there were no stock grants for the year ended december  during the period from september  through december   we awarded  shares of restricted stock pursuant to our incentive plan to the independent members of our board of directors 
these shares vested on the date of the grant 
clearing fees we use rcap securities inc  or rcap  a sec registered broker dealer and a wholly owned subsidiary of annaly  to clear trades for us and rcap is entitled to customary market based fees and charges arising from such services 
contractual obligations and commitments as of december  we financed our cmbs portfolio with non recourse financings under the talf 
pursuant to our non recourse financing under the talf  we have entered into a long term debt obligation with the frbny 
please see table below to summarize our contractual obligation at december  and december  december  within one year one to three years three to five years greater than five years total contractual obligations dollars in thousands secured financing interest expense on secured financing total december  within one year one to three years three to five years greater than five years total contractual obligations dollars in thousands secured financing interest expense on secured financing total we have agreed to pay the underwriters of our initial public offering per share for each share sold in the initial public offering if during any full four calendar quarter period during the full calendar quarters after our initial public offering our core earnings as described below for any such four quarter period exceeds an performance hurdle rate as described below 
the performance hurdle rate will be met if during any full four calendar quarter period during the full calendar quarters after the consummation of our initial public offering our core earnings for any such four quarter period exceeds the product of x the weighted average of the issue price per share of all public offerings of our common stock  multiplied by the weighted average number of shares outstanding including any restricted stock units  any restricted shares of common stock and any other shares of common stock underlying awards granted under our equity incentive plans in such four quarter period and y 
core earnings is a non gaap measure and is defined as gaap net income loss excluding non cash equity compensation expense  depreciation and amortization to the extent that we foreclose on any properties underlying our target assets  any unrealized gains  losses or other non cash items recorded for the period  regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss  or in net income 
the amount will be adjusted to exclude one time events pursuant to changes in gaap and certain other non cash charges after discussions between fidac and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of our independent directors 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
dividends to qualify as a reit  we must pay annual dividends to our stockholders of at least of our taxable income  determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains 
we intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders 
before we pay any dividend  whether for us federal income tax purposes or otherwise  which would only be paid out of available cash to the extent permitted under our warehouse and repurchase facilities  we must first meet both our operating requirements and scheduled debt service on our warehouse lines and other debt payable 
capital expenditures at december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities will be interest rate sensitive in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors will influence our performance far more so than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and our distributions will be determined by our board of directors consistent with our obligation to distribute to our stockholders at least of our reit taxable income on an annual basis in order to maintain our reit qualification  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and or fair market value without considering inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary components of our market risk are related to credit risk  interest rate risk  prepayment and market value risk 
while we do not seek to avoid risk completely  we believe the risk can be quantified from historical experience and seek to actively manage that risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake 
credit risk we are subject to credit risk  which is the risk of loss due to a borrower s failure to repay principal or interest on a loan  a security or otherwise fail to meet a contractual obligation  in connection with our assets and will face more credit risk on assets we own which are rated below aaa 
the credit risk related to these assets pertains to the ability and willingness of the borrowers to pay  which is assessed before credit is granted or renewed and periodically reviewed throughout the loan or security term 
we believe that residual loan credit quality is primarily determined by the borrowers credit profiles and loan characteristics 
fidac uses a comprehensive credit review process 
fidac s analysis of loans includes borrower profiles  as well as valuation and appraisal data 
fidac s resources include a proprietary portfolio management system  as well as third party software systems 
fidac selects loans for review predicated on risk based criteria such as loan to value  a property s operating history and loan size 
fidac rejects loans that fail to conform to our standards 
fidac accepts only those loans which meet our underwriting criteria 
once we own a loan  fidac s surveillance process includes ongoing analysis and oversight by our third party servicer and us 
additionally  cmbs  other commercial real estate related securities and rmbs which we acquire for our portfolio will be reviewed by fidac to ensure that we acqui re cmbs  other commercial real estate related securities and rmbs which satisfy our risk based criteria 
fidac s review of cmbs  other commercial real estate related securities and rmbs includes utilizing its proprietary portfolio management system 
fidac s review of cmbs  other commercial real estate related securities and rmbs is based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of the risk adjusted returns such securities present 
interest rate risk interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations  as well as other factors beyond our control 
we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our assets and any related financing obligations 
in general  we may finance the acquisition of our targeted assets through financings in the form of borrowings under programs established by the us government  warehouse facilities  bank credit facilities including term loans and revolving facilities  resecuritizations  securitizations and repurchase agreements 
we may mitigate interest rate risk through utilization of hedging instruments  primarily interest rate swap agreements 
interest rate swap agreements are intended to serve as a hedge against future interest rate increa ses on our borrowings 
another component of interest rate risk is the effect changes in interest rates will have on the market value of the assets we acquire 
we face the risk that the market value of our assets will increase or decrease at different rates than that of our liabilities  including our hedging instruments 
we may acquire floating rate mortgage assets 
these are assets in which the mortgages are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors  which limit the amount by which the asset s interest yield may change during any given period 
our borrowing costs pursuant to our financing agreements  however  will not be subject to similar restrictions 
therefore  in a period of increasing interest rates  interest rate costs on our borrowings could increase without limitation by caps  while the interest rate yields on our floating rate mortgage assets would effectively be limited 
in addition  floating rate mortgage assets may be subject to periodic payment caps that resu lt in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding 
this could result in our receipt of less cash income on such assets than we would need to pay the interest cost on our related borrowings 
these factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates  which would harm our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
our analysis of interest rate risk is based on fidac s experience  estimates  models and assumptions 
these analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of asset allocation decisions by our management may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results shown in this form k 
interest rate effect on net interest income our operating results depend  in part  on differences between the income from our investments and our borrowing costs 
most of our warehouse facilities and repurchase agreements would provide financing based on a floating rate of interest calculated on a fixed spread over libor 
our structured financing through the term asset backed securities loan facility talf is at a fixed rate for the life of the loan based on swap rates at the submission date of the loan 
the fixed spread varies depending on the type of underlying asset which collateralizes the financing 
accordingly  if a portion of our portfolio consisted of floating interest rate assets would be match funded utilizing our expec ted sources of short term financing  while our fixed interest rate assets will not be match funded 
during periods of rising interest rates  the borrowing costs associated with our investments tend to increase while the income earned on our fixed interest rate investments may remain substantially unchanged  excluding the fixed rate borrowing with the talf 
this will result in a narrowing of the net interest spread between the related assets and borrowings and may even result in losses 
further  during this portion of the interest rate and credit cycles  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to us  which could adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
such delinquencies or defaults could also have an adverse effect on the spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
hedging techniques are partly based on assumed levels of prepayments of fixed rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans and cmbs 
if prepayments are slower or faster than assume d  the life of the mortgage loans and cmbs will be longer or shorter  which would reduce the effectiveness of any hedging strategies we may use and may cause losses on such transactions 
hedging strategies involving the use of derivative securities are highly complex and may produce volatile returns 
interest rate effects on fair value another component of interest rate risk is the effect changes in interest rates will have on the fair value of the assets we acquire 
we face the risk that the fair value of our assets will increase or decrease at different rates than that of our liabilities  including our hedging instruments 
we primarily assess our interest rate risk by estimating the duration of our assets and the duration of our liabilities 
duration essentially measures the market price volatility of financial instruments as interest rates change 
we generally calculate duration using various financial models and empirical data 
different models and methodologies can produce different duration numbers for the same securities 
it is important to note that the impact of changing interest rates on fair value can change significantly when interest rates change beyond basis points from current levels 
therefore  the volatility in the fair value of our assets could increase significantly when interest rates change beyond basis points 
in addition  other factors impact the fair value of our interest rate sensitive investments and hedging instruments  such as the shape of the yield curve  market expectations as to future interest rate changes and other market conditions 
accordingly  in the event of changes in actual interest rates  the change in the fair value of our assets would likely differ from that shown above and such difference might be material and adverse to ou r stockholders 
interest rate cap risk we may invest in adjustable rate mortgage loans and cmbs 
these are mortgages or cmbs in which the underlying mortgages are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors  which limit the amount by which the security interest yield may change during any given period 
however  our borrowing costs pursuant to our financing agreements will not be subject to similar restrictions 
therefore  in a period of increasing interest rates  interest rate costs on our borrowings could increase without limitation by caps  while the interest rate yields on our adjustable rate mortgage loans and cmbs would effectively be limited 
this problem will be magnified to the extent we acquire adjustable rate cmbs that are not based on mortgages w hich are fully indexed 
in addition  the mortgages or the underlying mortgages in a cmbs may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding 
this could result in our receipt of less cash income on our adjustable rate mortgages or cmbs than we need in order to pay the interest cost on our related borrowings 
these factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates  which would harm our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
interest rate mismatch risk we may fund a portion of our acquisitions of hybrid adjustable rate mortgages  cmbs and rmbs with borrowings that  after the effect of hedging  have interest rates based on indices and repricing terms similar to  but of somewhat shorter maturities than  the interest rate indices and repricing terms of the mortgages  cmbs and rmbs 
thus  we anticipate that in most cases the interest rate indices and repricing terms of our mortgage assets and our funding sources will not be identical  thereby creating an interest rate mismatch between assets and liabilities 
therefore  our cost of funds would likely rise or fall more quickly than would our earnings rate on assets 
during periods of changing interest rates  such interest rate mismatches could neg atively impact our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
to mitigate interest rate mismatches  we may utilize the hedging strategies discussed above 
our analysis of risks is based on our manager experience  estimates  models and assumptions 
these analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of investment decisions by our management may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results shown in this form k 
our profitability and the value of our portfolio including interest rate swaps may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net interest income  portfolio value should interest rates go up or down   and basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  and various estimates regarding prepayment and all activities are made at each level of rate shock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
projected percentage change in projected percentage change in change in interest rate net interest income portfolio value basis points basis points basis points base interest rate basis points basis points basis points prepayment risk as we receive prepayments of principal on our assets  premiums paid on such assets will be amortized against interest income 
in general  an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums  thereby reducing the interest income earned on the assets 
conversely  discounts on such investments are accreted into interest income 
in general  an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the accretion of purchase discounts  thereby increasing the interest income earned on our assets 
for commercial real estate loans  the risk of prepayment is mitigated by call protection  which includes defeasance  yield maintenance premiums and prepayment charges 
extension risk for cmbs and agency rmbs  fidac computes the projected weighted average life of our assets based on assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay the underlying mortgages 
in general  when a fixed rate or hybrid adjustable rate asset is acquired with borrowings  we may  but are not required to  enter into an interest rate swap agreement or other hedging instrument that effectively fixes our borrowing costs for a period close to the anticipated average life of the fixed rate portion of the related assets 
this strategy is designed to protect us from rising interest rates because the borrowing costs are fixed for the duration of the fixed rate portion of the related mortgage backed security 
if prepayment rates decrease in a rising interest rate environment  however  the life of the fixed rate portion of the related assets could extend beyond the term of the swap agreement or other hedging instrument 
this could have a negative impact on our results from operations  as borrowing costs would no longer be fixed after the end of the hedging instrument while the income earned on the hybrid adjustable rate assets would remain fixed 
this situation may also cause the market value of our hybrid adjustable rate assets to decline  with little or no offsetting gain from the related hedging transactions 
in extreme situations  we may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity  which could cause us to incur losses 
market risk market value risk our available for sale securities are reflected at their estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income 
the estimated fair value of these securities fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors 
generally  in a rising interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to decrease  conversely  in a decreasing interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to increase 
as market volatility increases or liquidity decreases  the fair value of our assets may be adversely impacted 
if we are unable to readily obtain independent pricing to validate our estimated fair value of the securities in our portfolio  the fair value gains or losses recorded in other comprehe nsive income may be adversely affected 
real estate risk commercial property values are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  national  regional and local economic conditions which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors  local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of housing  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  construction quality  age and design  demographic factors  and retroactive changes to building or similar codes 
in addition  decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay our loans  which could also cause us to suffer losses 
risk management to the extent consistent with maintaining our reit status  we will seek to manage risk exposure to protect our portfolio of commercial mortgage loans  cmbs  and commercial mortgage securities and related debt against the credit and interest rate risks 
we generally seek to manage our risk by analyzing the borrower profiles  as well as valuation and appraisal data  of the loans we acquire 
we expect that fidac s resources include a proprietary portfolio management system  as well as third party software systems  using fidac s proprietary portfolio management system to review our cmbs and other commercial real estate related securities  monitoring and adjusting  if necessary  the reset index and interest rate related to our targeted assets and our financings  attempting to structure our financings agreements to have a range of different maturities  terms  amortizations and interest rate adjustment periods  using derivatives  financial futures  swaps  options  caps  floors and forward sales to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of our targeted assets and our borrowings  using securitization financing to lower average cost of funds relative to short term financing vehicles further allowing us to receive the benefit of attractive terms for an extended period of time in contrast to short term financing and maturity dates of the assets included in the securitization  and actively managing  on an aggregate basis  the interest rate indices  interest rate adjustment periods  and gross reset margins of our targeted assets and the interest rate indices and adjustment periods of our financings 
our efforts to manage our assets and liabilities are concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
we attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
methods for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of our interest rate sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets and liabilities  except adjustable rate loans  and securities are included in the period in which their interest rates are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature and does include the effect of the interest rate swaps 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities in the table could vary substantially if based on actual prepayment experience 
within year to greater than months months years years total rate sensitive assets  principal balance cash equivalents total rate sensitive assets rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total rate sensitive assets our analysis of risks is based on our manager experience  estimates  models and assumptions 
these analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of investment decisions by our manager may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results shown in the above tables and in this form k
