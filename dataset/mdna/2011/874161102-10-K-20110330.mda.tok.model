management overview in  we executed a comprehensive financing solution and commenced the implementation of several broad strategic initiatives 
these activities are components of our comprehensive strategy to build our updated brand and strengthen our organization with a focus on top line sales  profitability and productivity improvements over the long term 
on april   we completed a series of transactions collectively  the bpw transactions which  in the aggregate  substantially reduced our indebtedness and significantly deleveraged our balance sheet  consisting of three related transactions i an agreement and plan of merger between talbots and bpw acquisition corp 
bpw pursuant to which a wholly owned subsidiary of the company merged with and into bpw in exchange for the company s issuance of talbots common stock and warrants to bpw stockholders  ii the repurchase and retirement of all shares of talbots common stock held by aeon usa  inc aeon usa  our then majority shareholder  totaling million shares  the issuance of warrants to purchase one million shares of talbots common stock to aeon usa and the repayment of all of our outstanding debt with aeon co  ltd 
aeon and aeon usa at its principal value plus accrued interest and other costs for total cash consideration of million  and iii the execution of a third party senior secured revolving credit facility which provides borrowing capacity up to million  subject to availability and satisfaction of all borrowing conditions 
as of april   as a result of these transactions  we reduced our outstanding debt by approximately million and increased stockholders equity by approximately million 
since the close of these transactions  we have sought to translate our operating results into a further improved financial position  reducing debt by an additional million through january  and ending the year with a positive equity balance and positive net working capital 
with the liquidity provided by the bpw transactions  management has been able to expand the scope of its strategic initiatives to include programs designed to provide planned reinvestment in key aspects of the business  including an enhanced marketing campaign  the launch of a store re image initiative and an information technology enhancement and upgrade  while continuing to focus on programs designed and intended to improve upon our leaner operating structure  including the launch of our segmentation strategy and a plan to rationalize and reduce our store real estate portfolio and square footage 

table of contents in fiscal  we launched an enhanced  coordinated marketing campaign  including a return to national and regional advertising  e commerce advertising and increased in store visual  aimed at increasing brand awareness and customer retention  reactivation and acquisition  by providing current and prospective future customers with images designed to communicate our updated brand image of tradition transformed 
we expect to continue this campaign in the coming year and will continue to evaluate the results achieved  making any adjustments to the strategy as we deem appropriate 
further in  we began the roll out of our store re image initiative  a program which is designed to translate our updated brand image into a renovated storefront and store lay out and is aimed at increasing customer traffic 
the phases undertaken in fiscal included renovations of fourteen retail stores  storefront refreshes of eleven additional stores and a complete rebuild of a retail location in a key market  which serves as our design concept store 
based on the results of the renovations undertaken to date  we plan to initiate the next phase of our re image initiative in fiscal  including anticipated renovations of up to approximately stores 
going forward  we will continue to evaluate the results achieved as well as the scope and execution of any future phases of the initiative 
fiscal also marked the start of the reinvestment phase of our three year it systems strategic plan which focuses on making systems enhancements designed to aid management in understanding and meeting customer needs  driving growth across the business and promoting operational excellence 
most significantly  we commenced the process of upgrading our oracle financial system and implementing our oracle and jda merchandise financial planning  assortment planning and allocation systems 
these systems will provide cross functional support and analysis tools to better serve our business as well as a foundation for developing a leaner systems operation which will allow us to eliminate redundant systems and reduce customizations 
we expect these phases of our systems upgrade to be completed by the close of fiscal and expect to continue to reinvest in our information systems in the coming year as we continue to execute on this plan 
the fall selling season reflected the first distribution of product to our stores following our segmentation strategy  whereby we sort our stores based on customer lifestyle  behavior and climate  which seeks to improve store productivity by tailoring our merchandise assortment and store experience to specific segments 
we expect to continue to follow our segmentation strategy for determining merchandise allocation through  adjusting the mix and assortment of merchandise across the store categories as well as adjusting the store category classification of certain locations  based on the results of this implemented strategy as we go forward 
finally  in fiscal  we announced our intention to closely evaluate our store real estate portfolio and rationalize our store locations  under a program aimed at increasing the productivity of our store square footage 
this program was still in the early stages of evaluation at the close of fiscal  however in the fourth quarter of  we began to take advantage of opportunities to reduce leased store space in accordance with lease expirations of several leases  closing eighteen stores in the fourth quarter of our evaluation of our store portfolio includes consideration  on a market by market basis  of factors such as overall size and potential sales in each market  current performance and growth potential of each store  and available lease expirations  lease renewals and other lease termination opportunities 
in march  we announced the acceleration of our store rationalization plan  with an expectation to close approximately to stores and consolidate or downsize approximately to stores over the next two years  with a majority of these actions expected to be completed in fiscal these actions are expected to reduce gross square footage by approximately million square feet over the two year period 
we anticipate that a substantial part of these expected closings and square footage reductions will be implemented at stores which have lease expirations or other lease termination events occurring in this two year period 
in connection with this plan  we expect to incur approximately million in estimated lease exit  severance and related costs over the next two years 
the number  identity and timing of these actions are not final  continue to be subject to further ongoing evaluation and may be adjusted as we continue to finalize our plan 
we will continue to evaluate our store portfolio and may determine to close additional stores over the coming years 

table of contents going forward  we remain committed to our long range plan and strategic initiatives which focus on top line sales  profitability and productivity improvements  and include ongoing strategic reinvestments in our marketing campaign and capital expenditures related to our store re image initiative and information technology 
results of operations results of fiscal year include achieved operating income of million compared to an operating loss of million in the prior year  a improvement year over year  while recording million in incremental merger related costs  million of incremental expense related to the reinstatement and enhancement of operational performance based and certain other employee compensation programs and million of incremental marketing expense  partially offset by million of gift card breakage income  representing a one time cumulative change in estimate adjustment in  recorded net sales declines of in fiscal  compared to fiscal  improved gross profit margins to from in the prior year  and reduced total outstanding debt by million  or 
the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods shown below year ended january  january  january  net sales cost of sales  buying and occupancy selling  general and administrative merger related costs restructuring charges impairment of store assets operating income loss interest expense  net income loss before taxes income tax expense benefit income loss from continuing operations cost of sales  buying and occupancy is comprised primarily of the cost of merchandise including duties  inbound freight charges  shipping  handling and distribution costs associated with our direct operations  salaries and expenses incurred by our merchandising and sourcing operations and occupancy costs associated with our stores 
occupancy costs consist primarily of rent and associated depreciation  maintenance  property taxes and utilities 
selling  general and administrative is comprised primarily of the costs of employee compensation and benefits in the selling and administrative support functions  catalog operation costs relating to catalog production and call center  advertising and marketing costs  the cost of our customer loyalty program  costs related to management information systems and support and the costs and income associated with our credit card operations 
additionally  costs associated with our warehouse operations are included in selling  general and administrative and include costs of receiving  inspecting and warehousing merchandise as well as the costs related to store distribution of merchandise 
warehouse operations costs for  and are approximately million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents our gross margins may not be comparable to certain other companies  as there is diversity in practice as to which costs companies include in selling  general and administrative and cost of sales  buying and occupancy 
specifically  we include the majority of the costs associated with our warehousing operations in selling  general and administrative  while other companies may include these costs in cost of sales  buying and occupancy 
compared to net sales the following is a comparison of net sales for fiscal years and january  january  decrease increase in millions net store sales net direct marketing sales total store sales reflected in net store sales for fiscal year is a million  or  decrease in comparable store sales compared to fiscal year this decrease is significantly attributable to reduced customer traffic due to  among other factors  weaker than anticipated customer response to our merchandise assortment  increased levels of competitive promotional activity and weather related issues in the fourth quarter  which led to a decline in the number of comparable store transactions 
we began fiscal year building on momentum from the second half of fiscal year and saw positive comparable store sales in the first half of the year 
this momentum did not continue in the second half of the year  despite our increased promotional activity and efforts in the fourth quarter in order to be more competitive in what proved to be a more promotional environment than anticipated 
in the second half of the year  our enhanced marketing campaign entered a significant phase with the roll out of our national advertising campaign 
we believe our enhanced marketing strategy and related initiatives are significant to achieving our tradition transformed brand vision and believe that these brand building efforts will take time to gain traction and translate into increased customer traffic and net sales 
sales metrics for comparable stores for fiscal year were as follows customer traffic decreased year over year  yet the rate of converting traffic to transactions increased  contributing to a decrease in the number of transactions per store 
additionally  units per transaction were up which  combined with a increase in average unit retail  contributed to a increase in dollars per transaction over fiscal year comparable stores are those stores  excluding surplus outlets  that are open for at least full months 
when the square footage of a store is increased or decreased by at least  the store is excluded from the computation of comparable store sales for a period of full months 
as of january   we operated a total of stores with gross and selling square footage of approximately million square feet and million square feet  respectively  a decrease of approximately in gross square footage and in selling square footage from january   when we operated retail stores 
direct marketing sales direct marketing sales in fiscal increased compared to fiscal year while the percentage of our net sales derived from direct marketing increased to from in fiscal these increases can be primarily attributed to an million comparative increase in red line phone sales  which are sales resulting from direct lines in our stores to our call center  as well as increased internet sales 
internet sales were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase is primarily due to changing trends in consumer purchasing behavior  with declines in catalog sales partially offsetting the increase in internet sales 

table of contents cost of sales  buying and occupancy the following is a comparison of cost of sales  buying and occupancy for fiscal years and january  january  decrease in millions cost of sales  buying and occupancy percentage of net sales in fiscal year  net sales declines of million were offset by cost of sales  buying and occupancy declines of million  resulting in a basis point improvement in gross profit margin to from in fiscal year this improvement in gross profit margin was primarily driven by gains in merchandise margin  which was up basis points as a result of changes to our sourcing practices and correlated to improvements in our initial mark up rate imu compared to fiscal year occupancy expenses as a percent of net sales also improved basis points  primarily due to comparatively lower depreciation expense  while buying expenses as a percent of net sales improved basis points 
although we recorded a basis point improvement in gross profit margin year over year in fiscal  we do not expect our gross profit margin improvements to be as strong year over year in fiscal  largely due to expectations of incrementally higher merchandise costs  correlated to rising commodity prices  and continued promotional pressure in the market 
selling  general and administrative the following is a comparison of selling  general and administrative for fiscal years and january  january  decrease in millions selling  general and administrative percentage of net sales in fiscal year  we reinstated and enhanced operational performance based and certain other employee compensation programs that were suspended in the prior year  recording related incremental compensation expense of million in fiscal further  in  we increased our investment in marketing  including expanded national and regional advertising  e commerce advertising and increased in store visual  recording incremental marketing expense of million in fiscal these planned reinvestments in our business were offset by expense savings that continue to be realized from actions taken under our fiscal year expense reduction program  allowing us to reduce selling  general and administrative year over year while making these strategic reinvestments 
selling  general and administrative in fiscal also reflect a change in our estimate of gift card breakage  whereby in fiscal  we refined our estimate of gift card redemptions and began to recognize income from the breakage of gift cards when the likelihood of redemption of the gift card is considered remote 
gift card breakage income of million  including a cumulative  one time adjustment of million  was recorded in fiscal year as an offset to selling  general and administrative 
merger related costs during fiscal years and  we incurred million and million of merger related costs  respectively  in connection with our acquisition of bpw 
these costs primarily consist of investment banking  professional services fees  an incentive award given to certain executives and members of senior management as a result of the closing of this transaction and  in  are partially offset by a net gain on the settlement of shareholder litigation 
refer to part i item  legal proceedings  for further information regarding this settlement 

table of contents restructuring charges the following is a comparison of restructuring charges for fiscal years and january  january  decrease in millions restructuring charges percentage of net sales the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal primarily relate to the consolidation of our madison avenue flagship location wherein we reduced active leased floor space and wrote down certain assets and leasehold improvements no longer used in the redesigned lay out 
restructuring charges incurred in fiscal primarily include severance costs recorded in february and june due to corporate headcount reductions  estimated lease termination costs associated with the portion of our tampa  florida data center which we ceased to use in july and severance and lease termination costs incurred related to the closing of our hong kong and india sourcing offices and the reduction of corporate sourcing headcount 
impairment of store assets we regularly monitor the performance and productivity of our store portfolio 
when we determine that a store is underperforming or is to be closed  we reassess the recoverability of the store s long lived assets  which in some cases can result in an impairment charge 
when a store is identified for impairment analysis  we estimate the fair value of the store assets using an income approach  which is based on estimates of future operating cash flows at the store level 
these estimates  which include estimates of future net store sales  direct store expenses and non cash store adjustments  are based on the experience of management  including historical store operating results  its knowledge and expectations 
these estimates can be affected by factors that can be difficult to predict  such as future operating results  customer activity and future economic conditions 
in both fiscal years and  we recorded impairments of store assets of million 
in fiscal year  store impairment analyses were triggered both by management reviews of the stores operating results as well as our anticipated closures of store locations 
in fiscal year  store impairment analyses were primarily triggered by management reviews of the stores operating results 
our analysis of the store locations approved for closure  consolidation or downsizing under our accelerated store rationalization plan as well as any additional store closures or negative trends in store performance may result in additional impairments of store assets in the coming year 
interest expense  net the following is a comparison of net interest expense for fiscal years and january  january  decrease in millions interest expense  net net interest expense in fiscal decreased compared to fiscal primarily due to reductions in the weighted average debt outstanding in the respective periods  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  partially offset by an increase in the comparable effective interest rates  from in fiscal to in fiscal while the year over year effective interest rate increased in fiscal  it has sequentially declined over each quarterly period to a low of in the fourth quarter of reductions in debt related interest expense were partially offset by increased tax related interest expense year over year 
we expect interest expense to be comparatively lower in the coming year 

table of contents income tax expense benefit the following is a comparison of income tax expense benefit for fiscal years and january  january  increase in millions income tax expense benefit in fiscal years and  our effective income tax rate  including discrete items  was and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate is based upon the income or loss for the year  the composition of the income or loss in different jurisdictions and discrete adjustments for settlements of tax audits or assessments  the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and non deductible costs associated with the merger 
income tax expense in fiscal is comprised primarily of discrete items  specifically changes in estimates related to previously existing uncertain tax positions based on new information recorded in the second quarter of the income tax benefit in fiscal was primarily impacted by the intra period tax allocation arising from other comprehensive income recognized from the remeasurement of our pension plan and supplemental executive retirement plan obligations due to our decision to discontinue future benefits being earned under the plans effective as of may   which resulted in an allocated tax benefit of million to continuing operations and an offsetting tax expense included in other comprehensive income 
we continue to provide a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets  excluding deferred tax liabilities for non amortizing intangibles 
compared to net sales the following is a comparison of net sales for fiscal years and january  january  decrease in millions net store sales net direct marketing sales total store sales reflected in talbots store sales is a million  or  decline in comparable store sales for  due to the lackluster customer shopping behaviors we experienced throughout the first half of the year 
we believe this was a carryover from the latter part of as the difficult economic environment significantly influenced consumers discretionary spending 
when our customer was shopping  key fashion items at entry level price points were the main driver of sales 
we remained steadfast in managing on lean inventory while improving our flow of merchandise  optimizing our markdowns and presenting our customer with a stronger mix of regular price to markdown merchandise 
sales metrics for were as follows customer traffic declined and the rate of converting traffic to transactions declined  resulting in a decline in the number of transactions 
additionally  units per transaction were down  with a increase in average unit retail  resulting in a decline in dollars per transaction 
we began to see improvement in our sales metrics beginning in the third quarter which continued through the end of the year 
although we experienced a decline in fourth quarter traffic and transactions  dollars per transaction increased reflecting an improvement in regular price selling 
despite a year over year decline in sales and certain other related metrics  we had reason to believe that customer perception of our merchandise continued to improve 
market research we conducted during the third quarter of indicated that our best customers  those who spend the most money shopping with us  gave our merchandise its 
table of contents highest rating in recent years 
our lower spenders also rated our merchandise at its highest levels in recent years  although not as high as our best customers 
comparable stores are those stores  excluding surplus outlets  that are open for at least full months 
when the square footage of a store is increased or decreased by at least  the store is excluded from the computation of comparable store sales for a period of full months 
as of january   we operated a total of stores with gross and selling square footage of approximately million square feet and million square feet 
this represents a decrease of approximately in gross and selling square footage  respectively  from january   when we operated retail stores with gross and selling square footage of approximately million square feet and million square feet  respectively 
the decrease in square footage is due to the opening of upscale outlets and one retail store offset by the closing of retail stores 
direct marketing sales we experienced an decline in direct marketing sales in compared to while the percentage of our net sales derived from direct marketing increased to in from in the increase in direct marketing as a percent of total sales is partially due to more aggressive selling and promoting of our direct marketing sales that originate in our stores via red line phones  which are direct lines to our call center 
also contributing to the improvement  beginning in the fall season  we presented our customer with a stronger mix of regular price merchandise  achieved better fulfillment and experienced lower returns 
direct marketing sales in the third quarter were essentially flat compared to the prior year and we experienced an increase in the fourth quarter on a year over year basis 
internet sales in represented of our direct marketing sales compared to in we believe our investment in our new internet platform coupled with changing trends in consumer purchasing behavior  contributed to the increase in internet sales as a percentage of direct marketing 
cost of sales  buying and occupancy the following is a comparison of cost of sales  buying and occupancy for fiscal years and january  january  decrease in millions cost of sales  buying and occupancy percentage of net sales the decrease in cost of sales  buying and occupancy represents a basis point improvement from the prior year 
the improvement includes a basis point improvement in merchandise margin as a percent of sales 
the improvement in merchandise margin was driven by changes to our sourcing practices  improved inventory management and stronger regular price selling specifically in the second half of the year 
the improvement in cost of sales is offset by a basis point increase in occupancy costs and a basis point increase in buying costs  both of which rose as a percent of sales despite reductions in actual costs 
these increases as a percent of sales are attributable to negative leverage from the decline in sales for the year  as actual costs for occupancy and buying were reduced from the prior year 
selling  general and administrative the following is a comparison of selling  general and administrative for fiscal years and january  january  decrease in millions selling  general and administrative percentage of net sales in early  we established a goal of reducing annual expense by million by the end of fiscal approximately of this reduction was expected to be within selling  general and administrative 
by the end of fiscal  we reduced selling  general and administrative by million  substantially achieving our two year 
table of contents goal in one year 
our expense reductions were primarily realized in payroll and employee benefits and the balance in other corporate overhead expenses as we reduced our workforce by during merger related costs in  we incurred million of merger related costs in connection with our acquisition of bpw 
these costs primarily consist of investment banking and professional services fees 
restructuring charges the following is a comparison of restructuring charges for fiscal years and january  january  decrease in millions restructuring charges percentage of net sales the restructuring charges primarily relate to severance costs due to the corporate headcount reductions in february and june and costs to settle lease liabilities for a portion of our tampa  florida data center that is no longer being used 
additionally  we reorganized our global sourcing activities and entered into a buying agency agreement with li fung effective september li fung is now our exclusive global apparel sourcing agent for substantially all talbots apparel 
impairment of store assets the following is a comparison of impairment of store assets in fiscal years and january  january  decrease in millions impairment of store assets percentage of net sales we regularly monitor our store portfolio to identify stores that are underperforming and close stores when appropriate 
when we determine that a store is underperforming or is to be closed  we reassess the expected future cash flows of the store  which in some cases results in an impairment charge 
during the third quarter of  we identified and recorded an impairment charge of million related to underperforming stores 
interest expense  net the following is a comparison of net interest expense for fiscal years and january  january  increase in millions net interest expense average debt outstanding average interest rate on borrowings the increase in net interest expense was primarily due to higher average outstanding debt levels combined with a higher average interest rate on those borrowings 
interest expense in also includes million of amortization of the million loan fees paid to aeon in and million of breakage fees resulting from our early repayment of the bank debt on december  
table of contents income tax benefit expense the following is a comparison of income tax benefit expense for fiscal years and january  january  decrease in millions income tax benefit expense the income tax benefit in resulted primarily from the intra period tax allocation arising from other comprehensive income recognized from the remeasurement of our pension plan and serp obligations due to our decision to discontinue future benefits being earned under the plans effective as of may  this resulted in a tax expense of approximately million in other comprehensive income and an offsetting benefit in continuing operations 
the income tax expense in is due to the establishment of a valuation allowance of million for substantially all of our net deferred tax assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we concluded there was insufficient evidence that all of our deferred tax assets would be realized in the future

table of contents liquidity and capital resources over the past several years  management s strategies have focused on actions and initiatives designed to streamline our organization  reduce our cost structure and improve our gross margin performance and liquidity  culminating in the completion of the bpw transactions on april  with the completion of these transactions  we gained additional capital to strengthen our balance sheet  significantly reduced our outstanding indebtedness and corresponding interest expense and restored positive shareholders equity 
with the liquidity provided by the bpw transactions  management has been able to expand the scope of its strategic initiatives to include programs designed and intended to provide planned reinvestment in key aspects of the business  including enhanced marketing campaigns  the launch of a store re image initiative and an information technology enhancement and upgrade  while continuing to focus on programs designed and intended to continue to improve upon our leaner operating structure and enhance operating efficiencies  including a plan to rationalize and reduce our store portfolio 
the enhanced marketing campaign and store re image initiative represented incremental expense and capital expenditure spend in fiscal and will continue to require the use of the company s capital resources in fiscal our evaluation of our store portfolio includes consideration  on a market by market basis  of factors such as overall size and potential sales in each market  current performance and growth potential of each store  and available lease expirations  lease renewals and other lease termination opportunities 
in march  we announced the acceleration of our store rationalization plan  with an expectation to close approximately to stores and consolidate or downsize approximately to stores over the next two years  with a majority of these actions expected to be completed in fiscal these actions are expected to reduce gross square footage by approximately million square feet over the two year period 
we anticipate that a substantial part of these expected closings and square footage reductions will be implemented at stores which have lease expirations or other lease termination events occurring in this two year period 
any action to close stores under this program  particularly prior to the end of their lease terms  may require the company to provide up front payment in the form of lease exit or termination fees 
in connection with this plan  we expect to incur approximately million in estimated lease exit  severance and related costs over the next two years  some of which will require the use of company resources 
we continue to monitor our expenditures and expect to make our most significant reinvestments in planned programs intended to improve top line sales  profitability or productivity 
we finance our working capital needs  operating costs  capital expenditures  strategic initiatives and restructurings and debt and interest payment requirements through cash generated by operations and existing credit facilities 
at january  we held million of cash and cash equivalents  with cash equivalents defined as highly liquid instruments with a purchased maturity of three months or less  including payments due from credit card processors and banks for third party credit card and debit card transactions which are generally processed within one to five business days

the company and certain of our subsidiaries have executed a guaranty and security agreement pursuant to which all obligations under the credit facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis 
additionally  pursuant to the security agreement  all obligations are secured by i a first priority perfected lien and security interest in substantially all assets of the company and any guarantor from time to time and ii a first lien mortgage on our hingham  massachusetts headquarters facility and lakeville  massachusetts distribution facility

the credit facility is our only outstanding debt agreement at january  of the million borrowed under the credit facility at its inception  approximately million was outstanding at january  further at january   we had million in outstanding letters of credit and letter of credit availability of up to million under the master agreement  included as part of our total additional borrowing availability under the credit facility  subject to borrowing capacity restrictions described therein 
outlook our ability to obtain additional financing as needed depends upon many factors  including our financial projections and our prospects and creditworthiness  as well as external economic conditions and general liquidity in the credit markets 
we expect that our primary uses of cash in the next twelve months will be concentrated in i funding operations  strategic initiatives and working capital needs  ii investing in capital expenditures with approximately million in capital expenditures expected for fiscal  primarily related to the store re image initiative 
table of contents and investments in our operations  finance and information technology systems  and iii seeking to continue to further deleverage our consolidated balance sheet by further reducing our outstanding obligation under the credit facility 
additionally  we may be required to make significant payments over the next twelve months to a state tax authority regarding certain tax matters which have been subject to appeal  pending final resolution and the outcome of potential negotiations with this authority 
our cash and cash equivalents were million as of january  based on our current assumptions  our forecast and operating cash flow plan for fiscal year  our anticipated borrowing availability under the credit facility and the improvements to the company s capital composition  we anticipate that the company will have sufficient liquidity to finance anticipated working capital and other expected cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
our ability to meet our cash needs  obtain additional financing as needed and satisfy our operating and other non operating costs will depend upon  among other factors  our future operating performance and creditworthiness as well as external economic conditions and the general liquidity of the credit markets 
cash flows the following is a summary of cash flows from continuing operations for fiscal years  and year ended january  january  january  in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash provided by operating activities in fiscal is the result of earnings excluding non cash items of million  partially offset by a million increase in cash used in working capital changes  whereas cash provided by operating activities in fiscal and fiscal is the result of lower investment in working capital of million and million  respectively  supplemented by earnings excluding non cash items of million and million  respectively 
this shift in the composition of cash provided by operating activities  from being primarily the result of working capital changes to being primarily the result of earnings excluding non cash items in fiscal  is primarily owed to the company s leaner operating structure in fiscal and improvements in the company s capital composition as a result of the bpw transactions 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal and also includes the payment of million and million in merger related costs  respectively 
cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by investing activities was million during fiscal compared to cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the cash flows provided by investing activities in fiscal primarily reflect the million of cash and cash equivalents acquired in the merger with bpw on april  refer to merger with bpw and related financing transactions for further information regarding this transaction 
cash flows used in investing activities relate solely to purchases of property and equipment in all periods presented 
cash used for purchases of property and equipment during fiscal was million compared to million during fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  we planned a reduction in capital expenditures  generally limiting our capital investments to more essential replacement property  additions for new stores and a strategic platform refresh of our e commerce site as part of an overall spend reduction program 
in fiscal  we planned an increase in capital expenditures for strategic reinvestments through our store re image initiative  investments in our information technology systems and the expansion of our upscale outlets  with eleven new locations opening in fiscal 
table of contents in fiscal  we completed store renovations of fourteen retail locations in three key markets under our store re image initiative and began storefront refreshes of eleven additional locations 
these refreshes were completed in early fiscal further  in fiscal  we completed the full rebuild of an additional location in a key market  designed to reflect the company s comprehensive vision of its updated brand image  with the transformed store re opening at the start of fiscal  and began rebuilds of similar scope on two additional locations  expected to be completed around the start of the second quarter of fiscal these phases of the store re image initiative represented incremental capital expenditures and related expenses  including accelerated depreciation of existing property and equipment disposed of under these phases in fiscal  with primarily all of the expenses classified as cost of sales  buying and occupancy in the consolidated statements of operations 
these renovations marked the introduction of a multi faceted store re image initiative  a program designed to translate our updated brand vision of tradition transformed into a renovated storefront and store lay out 
implementation of this initiative was primarily comprised of two programs first  a store renovation with new lay out  fixtures  and exterior updates and signage and second  a storefront refresh with new signage and exterior updates 
we have evaluated the renovations and refreshes completed to date and developed a modified program which combines key components of the store renovation and storefront refresh programs 
we believe this value engineering will enable us to improve and update an increased number of stores more quickly  incorporating the critical elements of a store renovation at a reduced cost 
we plan to initiate the next phase of our re image initiative  under this modified program  in fiscal  including renovations of up to approximately stores 
we believe the store re image initiative is a key component in our plan to improve customer traffic and drive store productivity and could be a significant portion of our future capital investment 
going forward  we will continue to evaluate the results achieved as well as the scope and execution of any future phases of the initiative 
we expect to spend approximately million in gross capital expenditures during the fiscal  primarily related to the store re image initiative and information technology improvements 
cash used in provided by financing activities cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal and million in fiscal this change is primarily correlated to an outstanding debt reduction in fiscal compared to an outstanding debt increase in fiscal years and  with outstanding debt totaling million at january  and million at january  the fiscal reduction of debt reflects the full repayment of all related party debt as part of the bpw transactions  totaling million 
refer to merger with bpw and related financing transactions for further information regarding this transaction 
in addition to this repayment  cash used in financing activities in fiscal includes the payment of million in debt and equity issuance costs related to the bpw transactions and the repurchase of shares from employee stock award holders  partially offset by net borrowings on our revolving credit facility of million  proceeds from the exercise of non tendered warrants of million and proceeds from stock options exercised 
in addition to net debt increases  financing activities in fiscal include the payment of debt issuance costs and the repurchase of shares from employee stock award holders 
in fiscal  financing activities include the payment of cash dividends  payment of debt issuance costs  the repurchase of shares from employee stock award holders and proceeds from stock options exercised  in addition to net debt increases 

table of contents contractual obligations  commercial commitments and contingent liabilities the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january  contractual obligations and less than to to more than commercial commitments total year years years years in thousands revolving credit facility  including estimated interest payments operating leases real estate equipment merchandise purchases construction contracts other contractual commitments benefit plan obligations unrecognized tax benefits total obligations and commitments revolving credit facility  including estimated interest payments represents amounts due under our revolving credit facility  including estimated interest payments 
our revolving credit facility matures on october   however  is considered to be a current obligation as it requires repayment of outstanding borrowings with substantially all cash collected by us and contains a subjective acceleration clause 
in consideration of the classification of this facility as a current obligation  the above table includes only the principal plus estimated interest payments for the next twelve months 
interest payments were estimated using the effective interest rate as of january  refer to liquidity and capital resources for further information regarding the credit facility 
operating leases represents future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of january   including six executed leases related to talbots stores not yet opened at january  and  the remaining lease payments for six former talbots kids and mens stores  two former j 
jill stores and the remaining portion of the quincy office space 
the minimum lease payments above do not include common area maintenance cam charges  real estate taxes or any rent that may be due in the future under contingent rent terms  such as incremental rent due as a function of sales volume 
equipment operating leases are primarily for store computer and other corporate equipment and have lease terms that generally range between three and five years 
as described in discontinued operations  under the terms of the sale of the j 
jill business  the purchaser is obligated for liabilities that arise after the closing under assumed contracts  which includes leases for j 
jill stores assigned to the purchaser as part of the sale  of which assigned leases remained outstanding at january  further  in connection with closing our uk stores in  three store leases were assigned to a local retailer who assumed the primary lease obligations  and  in connection with the closing of our mens stores  one store lease was assigned to a third party who assumed the primary lease obligations 
we remain secondarily liable in the event that the purchaser  the local retailer or other third party does not fulfill its lease obligations 
we have accrued a liability for the estimated exposure related to these contingent obligations 
at january   the future aggregate lease payments for which we remain contingently obligated  as transferor or sublessor  total million extending to various dates through fiscal any actual exposure may materially vary from estimated amounts 
the table above excludes these contingent liabilities 
merchandise purchases represents commitments by us to purchase merchandise from our network of vendors 
we generally make merchandise purchase commitments up to six to nine months in advance of the 
table of contents selling season and do not maintain any long term or exclusive commitments or arrangements to purchase from any vendor 
construction contracts represents amounts committed or contractually obligated under contracts to facilitate the build out and renovation of our stores 
other contractual commitments represents amounts committed or contractually obligated under contracts for products and services required in the normal course of operation  such as contracts for insurance  maintenance on equipment  services and advertising 
these contracts vary in length but generally carry day to three year terms 
benefit plan obligations represents estimates of annual cash payments expected to be made related to the serp  the supplemental k plan  the deferred compensation plan and the executive postretirement medical plan 
we sponsor various benefit plans for certain employees  including the pension plan  the serp  two deferred compensation plans and postretirement medical plans 
our postretirement medical plan for non executive retirees is entirely self funded effective january we also expect to make required contributions of million to the pension plan in fiscal which is not reflected in the table above 
unrecognized tax benefits represents income tax  interest and penalties expected to be due to various taxing authorities related to our uncertain tax positions 
as we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of certain of our other uncertain tax positions  the above table does not include million of income tax  interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits  including million of unrecognized tax benefit recorded as a result of the bpw transactions which is expected to be reversed in the coming year due to a favorable outcome of a private letter ruling request submitted by the company on this tax position and a million tax assessment related to certain state tax matters for which an adverse decision to the company on a similar issue was recently affirmed by a state appeals court 
to the extent that we do not prevail in this matter through any future appeals and the relevant state tax authority does not allow us to establish a payment plan related to this matter  we may be required to pay this assessment in the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made 
actual results and outcomes may differ materially from our estimates  judgments and assumptions 
estimates are periodically reviewed in light of changes in circumstances  facts and experience 
the effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate 
we define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles 
the principles that we believe to be our critical accounting policies are outlined below 
inventory markdown reserve merchandise inventories is a significant asset on our balance sheet  representing approximately of our total assets at january  we manage our inventory levels by using markdowns to clear merchandise as needed 
consistent with the retail inventory method  at the end of each reporting period  reductions in gross margin and inventory are recorded for estimated future markdowns necessary to liquidate remaining past season inventory 
the key factors influencing the reserve calculation are the overall level of past season inventory at the end of the reporting period and the expectation of future markdowns on this same merchandise 
the future markdown rate is 
table of contents reviewed regularly by comparing actual markdowns taken against previous estimates 
these results are then factored into future estimates 
historically  the difference between management s estimates and actual markdowns has not been significant 
if market conditions were to decline  customer acceptance of product was not favorable or our sales were otherwise less than anticipated  we may have excess inventory on hand and may be required to mark down inventory at a greater rate than estimated  resulting in an incremental charge to earnings 
we believe that at january  and january   the markdown reserve was appropriate based on the respective past season inventory levels  historical markdown trends and forecasts of future sales of past season inventory 
the markdown reserve rate of past season inventory was and at january  and january   respectively 
a basis point increase or decrease in this rate would impact income loss before taxes by approximately million in both fiscal years and gift card breakage proceeds from the sale of gift cards are recorded as a liability and are recognized as net sales when the cards are redeemed for merchandise 
our gift cards do not have an expiration date 
prior to the fourth quarter of  all unredeemed gift card proceeds were reflected as a liability until escheated in accordance with applicable laws 
we only recognized income from the non escheated portion of unredeemed gift cards after a period of time had passed subsequent to the filing of the corresponding escheatment  approximately equal to the statute of limitations for state audit of the escheated funds 
during the fourth quarter of  we identified a history of redemption and breakage patterns associated with our gift cards which supports a change in our estimate of the term over which we should recognize income on gift card breakage 
accordingly  beginning with the fourth quarter of  we recognize income from the breakage of gift cards when the likelihood of redemption of the gift card is remote 
we determine our gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns 
based on this historical information  the likelihood of a gift card remaining unredeemed can be reasonably estimated at the time of gift card issuance 
breakage income is then recognized over the estimated average redemption period of redeemed gift cards  for those gift cards for which the likelihood of redemption is deemed to be remote and for the amount for which there is no legal obligation for us to remit the value of such unredeemed gift cards to any relevant jurisdictions 
gift card breakage income is recorded as other operating income and is classified as a reduction of selling  general and administrative in our consolidated statement of operations 
breakage income of million  including a cumulative change in estimate of million  was recognized during fiscal sales return reserve as part of the normal sales cycle  we receive customer merchandise returns through both our store and direct marketing channels 
to account for the financial impact of this process  management estimates future returns on previously sold merchandise 
reductions in sales and gross margin are recorded for estimated merchandise returns based on return history  current sales levels  projected future return levels and any changes in our return policy 
our estimated sales returns are periodically compared to actual sales returns 
historically  the difference between the estimated sales returns and actual sales returns has not been significant 
if customer acceptance of our product is not favorable or if the product quality were to deteriorate  future actual returns may increase  resulting in a higher return rate and increased charges to earnings 
customer loyalty program we sponsor a customer loyalty program referred to as our classic awards program which rewards us talbots customers with a twenty five dollar appreciation award for every five hundred points earned 
prior to january  one point was earned for every dollar of merchandise purchased on a talbots credit card 
commencing in january  we launched an expanded program with three tiers red  platinum  and black 
the red tier is open to all customers  regardless of whether they hold a talbots credit card  and accrues points for every net dollar of merchandise purchased with a non talbots credit card payment 
the platinum tier is the same as the prior program with one point being earned for every net dollar of merchandise purchased on a talbots credit card 
the black tier is for talbots credit card holders who spend more than  net per calendar year on their talbots credit card  and accrues points for every net dollar of merchandise purchased on their talbots credit card 
appreciation awards may be applied to future merchandise purchases and expire one year after issuance 
appreciation award expense is calculated and recognized at the time of the initial customer purchase and is included in selling  general and administrative in the consolidated statement of operations 
our estimate of appreciation award expense at the time of recording is based on several factors which are subject to estimate and judgment  including actual and estimated purchase levels  actual awards issued and historical redemption rates 
actual awards 
table of contents issued and redemptions of awards may vary from the estimates used in our analysis based on actual customer responsiveness to the program  which could result in additional expense 
retirement plans we sponsor a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan the pension plan covering substantially all full time talbots and shared service employees in the us hired on or before december   two unfunded non qualified supplemental executive retirement plans collectively  the serp for certain talbots current and former key executives impacted by internal revenue code limits  and we provide certain medical benefits for most talbots retirees under postretirement medical plans 
in february  we announced our decision to discontinue future benefits being earned under the pension plan and serp effective may   and as a result  a remeasurement of the plan obligations occurred as of february  the remeasurement resulted in a decrease to other liabilities of million and million for the pension plan and serp  respectively  and an increase to other comprehensive income of million and million  net of tax  for the pension plan and serp  respectively 
additionally  effective january  the company s general postretirement medical plan became completely self funded 
three current and former executive officers continue to be covered under the company s executive postretirement medical plan which is not self funded  however  due to the limited number of participants  the company s expense under this plan has not historically been significant to any individual year 
in calculating our retirement plan obligations and related expense  we make various assumptions and estimates 
the annual determination of expense  which occurs at the end of our fiscal year  involves calculating the estimated total benefit ultimately payable to our plan participants and allocating this cost to the periods in which services are expected to be rendered 
significant assumptions related to the calculation of our obligations include the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations to be paid in the future and the expected long term rate of return on assets held by the pension plan 
these assumptions are reviewed annually based upon currently available information 
the discount rates that we apply are based  in part  upon a discount rate modeling process which matches the future benefit payment stream to a discount curve yield for the plan 
the discount rate is used  principally  to calculate the actuarial present value of our obligation and periodic expense attributable to our employee benefits plans 
the discount rate applied for the pension plan was and at january  and january   respectively 
the discount rate applied for the serp was and at january  and january   respectively 
to the extent that the discount rate increases or decreases  our obligations are decreased or increased accordingly 
a basis point change in the discount rates would have impacted our income loss before taxes by approximately million in both fiscal years and the expected long term rate of return on assets is the weighted average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the pension obligation and is based on an analysis which considers actual net returns for the pension plan since inception  ibbotson associates historical investment returns data for the three major classes of investments in which we invest equity  debt and foreign securities for the period since the pension plan s inception and for the longer period commencing when the return data was first tracked and expectations of future market returns from outside sources for the three major classes of investments in which we invest 
this rate is used primarily in estimating the expected return on plan assets component of the annual pension expense 
to the extent that the actual rate of return on assets is less than or more than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is not affected 
rather  this loss or gain adjusts future pension expense over a period of approximately five years 
we used an expected long term rate of return on assets of and at january  and january   respectively 
a basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have impacted our pre tax income by million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
long lived assets we regularly monitor the performance and productivity of our store portfolio 
when we determine that a store is underperforming or is to be closed  we reassess the recoverability of the store s long lived assets  which in some cases can result in an impairment charge 
when a store is identified for impairment analysis  we estimate the fair value of the store assets using an income approach  which is based on estimates of future operating cash flows at the store level 
these estimates  which include estimates of future net store sales  direct store expenses  and non cash store adjustments  are based on the experience of management  including historical store operating results  its knowledge and expectations 
these estimates can be affected by factors that can be difficult to 
table of contents predict  such as future operating results  customer activity and future economic conditions  and require management to apply judgment 
goodwill and other intangible assets we test our goodwill and trademarks for impairment on an annual basis  on the first day of each fiscal year  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets might not be recoverable 
we concluded that we have two reporting units  stores and direct marketing  and that the balance of goodwill recorded relates entirely to the stores reporting unit 
our trademarks are allocated between both reporting units 
we determine the fair value of our goodwill using a combination of an income approach and market value approach which collectively contemplate our operating results and financial position  forecasted operating results  industry trends  market uncertainty and comparable industry multiples 
the income approach requires significant judgments and estimates to project future revenues and expenses  changes in gross margins  cash flows and estimates of future capital expenditures for the reporting unit over a multi year period  as well as to determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate 
we believe the discount rate that we apply is consistent with the risks inherent in our business and with the retail industry 
the market approach requires the application of industry multiples of operating performance which are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating characteristics similar to our stores reporting unit 
our evaluation of goodwill inherently involves judgments as to assumptions used to project these amounts and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
our estimates may differ from actual results due to  among other matters  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in our operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially affect our future financial results 
we performed an impairment test of goodwill as of january   january  and february  these tests did not indicate an impairment of our goodwill 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that a negative change in our assumptions  namely a increase in the discount rate  a decrease in the market approach multiple or a decrease in forecasted earnings  would not have resulted in a change in our conclusions in or as to the recoverability of our goodwill as the computed fair value of the stores reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value by a significant margin 
we determine the fair value of our trademarks using an income approach  specifically the relief of royalty method 
this methodology assumes that  in lieu of ownership  a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of the asset 
this approach is dependent on a number of factors  including estimates of future sales  royalty rates of intellectual property  discount rates and other variables 
significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially affect our future financial results 
we performed an impairment test of our trademarks as of january   january  and february  these tests did not indicate an impairment of our trademarks 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that a negative change in our assumptions  namely a increase in the discount rate  a decrease in the market approach multiple or a decrease in forecasted earnings  would not have resulted in a change in our conclusions in or as to the recoverability of our trademarks 
income taxes we record deferred income taxes to recognize the effect of temporary differences between tax and financial statement reporting 
we calculate the deferred taxes using enacted tax rates expected to be in place when the temporary differences are realized and record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets  including recent earnings results  expectations of future taxable income  carry forward periods available and other relevant factors 
changes in the required valuation allowance are recorded in the period that the determination is made 
in fiscal year  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefits from our deferred tax assets and recorded a valuation allowance for substantially all of our net deferred tax assets  after considering sources of taxable income from reversing deferred tax liabilities 
we have maintained a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets  excluding deferred tax liabilities for non amortizing intangibles  through fiscal years and 
table of contents there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions 
we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements 
we classify our recorded uncertain tax positions as other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  unless expected to be resolved within one year 
we classify interest on uncertain tax positions in interest expense  income tax refunds in interest income and estimated penalties in selling  general and administrative in the consolidated statements of operations 
we are routinely under audit by various domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions 
there is significant judgment that is required in determining our provision for income taxes such as the composition of the taxable income or loss in different jurisdictions  changes in tax laws or rates  changes in the expected outcome of audits  the expiration of the statute of limitations on some tax positions and the effect of any new information about particular tax positions that may cause us to change our estimates 
changes in estimates may create volatility in our effective tax rate in future periods and may materially affect our results of operations 
we believe that our income tax related accruals are appropriate at january  and january  stock based compensation we issue stock based compensation awards including stock options  nonvested stock and restricted stock units 
related to such awards  we measure stock based compensation at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and we recognize such fair value as expense  on a straight line basis  over the corresponding vesting period 
we have selected the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards which requires the input of various assumptions which require management to apply judgment and make assumptions and estimates  including the expected life of the stock option award and the volatility of the underlying common stock 
our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods  and changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of future stock option awards  which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
nonvested stock and restricted stock units are valued at the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our stock based compensation awards and only recognize expense for those awards expected to vest 
if the actual forfeitures are materially different from our estimate  stock based compensation could be different from what we have recorded in the current period 
inflation and changing prices we believe that changes in revenues and net earnings that have resulted from inflation or deflation have not been material during the periods presented 
there is no assurance  however  that inflation or deflation will not materially affect us in the future 
exchange rates we enter into certain purchase obligations outside the united states which are predominately settled in us dollars 
in addition  as of january   we operated stores in canada which generate sales and incur expenses in local currency 
however  the local currency is generally stable and these operations represent only a small portion of our total operations 
accordingly  we have not experienced any significant impact from changes in exchange rates 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurements and disclosures 
asu amends asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  and requires new disclosures surrounding certain fair value measurements 
asu is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning on or after december   except for certain disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the rollforward of activity in level fair value measurements  which are effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning on or after december  during fiscal  we adopted the disclosure requirements effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning on or after december  
table of contents we intend to adopt the remaining disclosure requirements of asu when they become effective in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of this asu has expanded our disclosures regarding fair value measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
we do not expect the additional disclosure requirements of asu will have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu  disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
asu amends asc  receivables  and requires additional disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables  including credit card receivables  and the associated allowance for credit losses 
asu is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period ending on or after december   except for certain disclosures of information regarding activity that occurs during the reporting period  which are effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we have adopted the disclosure requirements effective for the first interim or annual reporting period ending on or after december  as of january  we intend to adopt the remaining disclosure requirements of asu when they become effective in the first quarter of the adoption of this asu has expanded our disclosures regarding customer accounts receivable and the associated allowance for doubtful accounts in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
we are still evaluating the impact of the additional provisions of this asu not yet adopted on our consolidated financial statements  however they are disclosure only in nature 
in december  the fasb issued asu  when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
asu amends asc  goodwill  by modifying the process of performing step of a goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying values to add an additional layer of qualitative evaluation 
under this amended guidance  a company would be required to perform step of a goodwill impairment test for a reporting unit with zero or negative carrying value if adverse qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
asu is effective for impairment tests performed during entities fiscal years that begin after december  the adoption of this asu is not expected to materially affect our goodwill impairment analyses in fiscal  as the fiscal year annual goodwill impairment test  performed as of january   reflected a positive carrying value of our stores reporting unit 
recent regulatory changes in may  the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of the credit card act was signed into law which resulted in new restrictions on credit card pricing  finance charges and fees  customer billing practices  payment allocation and also imposed additional disclosure requirements 
certain provisions of this legislation became effective in august and  as a result  we implemented new procedures to our credit card business practices and systems to ensure compliance with these rules 
revenue from our credit operations could be adversely affected as we adjust our practices to current and future regulations related to the credit card act 
in july  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the reform act was enacted  which is intended to govern the practices and increase oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets 
the reform act also creates a new federal agency  the consumer financial protection bureau  to supervise and enforce consumer lending laws and expands state authority over consumer lending

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments and in our financial position represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
as of january   we had outstanding variable rate borrowings of million under our credit facility 
the impact of a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates for this variable rate debt would have resulted in additional expense of approximately million for the year ended january  our pension plan assets are generally invested in readily liquid investments  primarily equity and debt securities 
generally  any deterioration in the financial markets or changes in discount rates may require us to make a contribution to our pension plan 
we enter into certain purchase obligations outside the united states which are predominately settled in us dollars and  therefore  we have only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
we do not hedge against foreign currency risks and believe that the foreign currency exchange risk is not material 
in addition  we operated stores in canada as of january  we believe that our foreign currency translation risk is immaterial  as a hypothetical strengthening or weakening of the us dollar relative to the applicable foreign currency would not materially affect our results of operations or cash flow
