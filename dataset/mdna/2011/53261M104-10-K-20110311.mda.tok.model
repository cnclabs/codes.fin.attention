overview we were founded in as a provider of content delivery network  or cdn  services to deliver digital content over the internet 
we began development of our infrastructure in and began generating meaningful revenue in in may  january  april and july  respectively  we acquired kiptronic  chors  eyewonder and delve 
today  limelight networks provides on demand software  platform  and infrastructure services that help global businesses reach and engage audiences on any mobile or connected device  enabling them to enhance their brand presence  build stronger customer relationships  manage video assets  analyze viewer preferences  optimize their advertising  and monetize their digital assets 
we provide services to customers in north america  emea  and the asia pacific region 
as of december   we had approximately  active customers worldwide 
we derive revenue from the sale of services to our customers 
these services include the delivery of digital media  including video  music  games  software and social media  the acceleration of web sites and web based applications  and value added services such as mobility  interactive advertising  computing  storage  data center  transit  and consulting 
we operate in one business segment 
our cdn customers normally execute contracts with terms of one year or longer  which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or long term contracts 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum commitment 
we have entered into an increasing number of customer contracts that have minimum usage commitments that are based on twelve month or longer periods and in some cases  other arrangements 
we believe that having a consistent and predictable base level of revenue is important to our financial success 
accordingly  to be successful  we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing any customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services  features and functionalities our existing customers purchase 
we also derive revenue from campaigns  services and events sold as discrete  non recurring events or based solely on usage 
for these services  we recognize revenue after an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the fee is fixed or determinable  the event or usage has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 
on march  we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock in which we sold and issued  shares of our common stock  including  shares subject to the underwriters over allotment option  at a price to the public of per share

table of contents the following table sets forth our historical operating results  as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  consolidated statement of operations data revenue cost of revenue cost of services depreciation network total cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses general and administrative sales and marketing research and development depreciation and amortization provision for litigation total operating expenses operating loss income other income expense interest expense interest income other income expense total other income expense loss income before income taxes income tax benefit expense net loss income traffic on our network and our cloud based services business has continued to grow 
this traffic growth is primarily the result of growth in the traffic delivered on behalf of both new and existing customers 
our cdn revenue is generated by charging for traffic delivered 
during  we continued to add new customers  both through new business and through our business acquisitions 
we have seen an increase in the length of our sales cycle  but we continue to see that new and existing customers want the benefits of the specialized services that we bring to the market 
we like the traction our cloud based services are getting in the market  the growth rates we are seeing there  and the growth rates in the core cdn business  which we believe are coming from market share gains as well as a healthier pricing environment 
historically  we have derived a relatively small portion of our revenue from outside of north america 
our international revenue has grown recently  and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on our strategy of expanding our network and customer base internationally 
for the years ended december   and  respectively  revenue derived from customers outside north america accounted for approximately  and respectively  of our total revenue 
for the years ended december   and  respectively  we derived approximately  and  respectively of our international revenue from emea and approximately  and  respectively of our international revenue from asia pacific 
we expect foreign revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars in our international business is managed as a single geographic segment  and we report our financial results on this basis 
during any given fiscal period  a relatively small number of customers typically account for a significant percentage of our revenue 
for example  in  sales to our top customers  in terms of revenue  accounted 
table of contents for approximately of our total revenue and we had no customer that accounted for more than of our revenue 
during and  revenue generated from sales to our top customers  in terms of revenue  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue 
during and  one of these top customers  microsoft  represented approximately and  respectively of our total revenue for that period 
we anticipate customer concentration levels will decrease compared to prior years 
in addition to selling to our direct customers  we maintain relationships with a number of resellers that purchase our services and charge a mark up to their end customers 
revenue generated from sales to reseller customers was approximately  and  respectively of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition to these revenue related business trends  our cost of revenue increased in absolute dollars and decreased as a percentage of revenue in when compared to this increase in absolute dollars is primarily the result of increased cost of backbone and peering costs associated with increased traffic on our network  increased co location fees associated with increased investments to build out the capacity of our network and increased operations personnel resulting from our business acquisitions and additional personnel required to operate our expanding network 
gross margin increased during as a result of the growth in our higher margin cloud based services from both our internally developed products and our acquisitions during the year 
through operating expenses increased in absolute dollars each period as revenue increased 
in  these increases were primarily due to increased litigation costs and legal fees associated with ongoing intellectual property litigation 
for the year ended december   operating expenses  excluding the provision for litigation  decreased compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to decreased general and administrative costs primarily litigation costs  bad debt expense and general legal fees and decreased sales and marketing costs primarily due to a reduction in marketing programs off set by increased research and development costs and non network related depreciation 
during  operating expenses  which includes operating expenses from our business acquisitions increased compared to this increase was primarily due to increased general and administrative costs primarily payroll and related employee costs  due to increased staffing and our annual bonus accrual  increased facility related expenses  additional fees  licenses and non income taxes  off set by lower litigation expenses and reduced bad debt expense  increased sales and marketing expenses primarily payroll and related employee costs due to increased staffing and increased research and development costs also  primarily payroll and related employee costs due to increased staffing  and increased non network related depreciation and amortization associated with the amortization of acquired intangible assets 
we make our capital investment decisions based upon careful evaluation of a number of variables  such as the amount of traffic we anticipate on our network  the cost of the physical infrastructure required to deliver that traffic  and the forecasted capacity utilization of our network 
our capital expenditures have varied over time  in particular as we purchased servers and other network equipment associated with our network build out 
for example  in and  we made capital purchases of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we made capital investments of million 
we continue to see improvements in the efficiency of our network allowing us to meet traffic growth with less investment  however  we expect to have ongoing capital expenditure requirements  as we continue to invest in and expand our cdn 
for  we currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of approximately of total revenue for the year 
occasionally we generate revenue from certain customers that are entities related to certain of our executives 
the aggregate amounts of revenue derived from these related party transactions was less than for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   we did not generate any revenue from related parties 
we are currently engaged in litigation with one of our principal competitors  akamai technologies  inc  or akamai  and its licensor  the massachusetts institute of technology  or mit  in which these parties have alleged 
table of contents that we are infringing three of their patents 
in february  a jury returned a verdict in this lawsuit  finding that we infringed four claims of the patent at issue united states patent no 
 the patent and rejecting our invalidity defenses 
the court conducted a bench trial in november  regarding our equitable defenses  and we filed a motion for reconsideration of the court s earlier denial of our motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol 
our motion for reconsideration of jmol was based largely upon a clarification in the standard for a finding of joint infringement articulated by the federal circuit in the case of muniauction  inc v 
thomson corp 
the muniauction case  released after the court denied our initial motion for jmol 
on april  the court issued its order and memorandum setting aside the adverse jury verdict and ruling that we did not infringe akamai s patent and that we are entitled to judgment as a matter of law 
based upon the court s april  order we reversed the million provision for litigation previously recorded for this lawsuit as we no longer believe that payment of any amounts represented by the litigation provision is probable 
the court entered final judgment in favor of us on may  akamai filed a notice of appeal of the court s decision on may   and the court of appeals for the federal circuit heard arguments by both parties on june  on december  the court of appeals for the federal circuit issued its opinion affirming the district court s entry of judgment in our favor 
on february   akamai filed a motion with the court of appeals for the federal circuit seeking a rehearing and rehearing en banc 
we believe that we do not infringe akamai s patents and will continue to vigorously defend our position 
in light of the favorable ruling from the court of appeals we do not believe that a loss is probable 
therefore  we have made no provision for this lawsuit in our financial statements 
in december  level communications  llc  or level  filed a lawsuit against us in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia alleging that we were infringing certain patents level acquired from savvis communications corp 
in addition to monetary relief  including treble damages  interest  fees and costs  the complaint sought an order permanently enjoining us from conducting our business in a manner that infringed the relevant patents 
a jury trial was conducted in january  and on january  the jury returned a verdict favorable to us finding that we did not infringe the level patents 
we believe the jury verdict finding that we did not infringe the level patents is correct  and that the claims of infringement asserted against us by level in the litigation were without merit 
the court denied level s subsequent motion for jmol or alternatively for a new trial  and entered a judgment in our favor 
level filed a notice of appeal on july  on may  the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit heard oral argument on this matter  and on may  the court affirmed the district court judgment in our favor 
level subsequently filed a motion for rehearing and rehearing en banc that the court subsequently denied 
in light of the favorable rulings from the court of appeals we consider this matter successfully concluded 
our legal and other expenses associated with this case have been significant 
we include these litigation expenses in general and administrative expenses  as reported in our condensed consolidated statement of operations 
in august  we  certain of our officers and current and former directors  and the firms that served as the lead underwriters in our initial public offering were named as defendants in several purported class action lawsuits filed in the united states district courts for the district of arizona and the southern district of new york 
all of the new york cases were transferred to arizona and consolidated into a single action 
the plaintiffs consolidated complaint asserted causes of action under sections   and of the securities act of  as amended  on behalf of a purported class of individuals who purchased our common stock in our initial public offering and or pursuant to our prospectus 
the complaint alleged  among other things  that we omitted and or misstated certain facts concerning the seasonality of our business and the loss of revenue related to certain customers 
on march   we and the individual defendants moved to dismiss all of the plaintiffs claims  a hearing was held on this motion on june  on august   the court granted the motion to dismiss  dismissing plaintiffs claims under section with prejudice and granting leave to amend the claims under sections and plaintiffs chose not to amend the claims under sections and  and on august   the court entered judgment in favor of us 
on september  plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal  and appellate briefs were filed by the parties in january and february  we believe that we and the individual defendants have meritorious defenses to the plaintiffs claims and intend to contest the lawsuit vigorously 
in november the parties entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle this lawsuit for an amount well within 
table of contents the coverage limits of the primary carrier of our directors and officers liability insurance  and on july  the parties entered into a settlement agreement consistent with the terms of the memorandum of understanding  which will require court approval 
a hearing before the federal district court is currently scheduled for march  we anticipate court approval of the settlement 
we do not believe that a loss is probable 
therefore  we have made no provision for this lawsuit in our financial statements 
we were unprofitable for the year ended december   significant items impacting our unprofitability were depreciation and amortization expense of million and share based compensation expense of million 
we were profitable for the year ended december  and unprofitable for the year ended december   respectively 
for the year ended december   the largest impact to our profitability was the reversal of our provision for litigation judgment accrual of million regarding the patent infringement lawsuit filed by akamai technologies  inc for the year ended december   the largest negative impact to our profitability was litigation costs of million  the accrual of million  for the potential continuing damages  plus additional interest of million  respectively from the jury verdict returned against us regarding the patent infringement lawsuit filed by akamai technologies  inc  and million in share based compensation 
our future results will be affected by many factors identified in the section captioned risk factors  in this annual report on form k  including our ability to increase our revenue by adding customers and limiting customer cancellations and terminations  as well as increasing the amount of monthly recurring revenue that we derive from our existing customers  manage the prices we charge for our services  as well as the costs associated with operating our network in light of increased competition  successfully manage our litigation with akamai to a favorable conclusion  prevent disruptions to our services and network due to accidents or intentional attacks  and continued ability to deliver a significant portion of our traffic through settlement free peering relationships which significantly reduce our cost of delivery 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will achieve our expected financial objectives  including positive net income 
basis of presentation revenue we derive revenue from the sale of content delivery network services to customers executing contracts having terms of one year or longer 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly or annual level of usage and provide the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly or annual minimum 
for these services  we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the service has been delivered to the customer  the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
should a customer s usage of our services exceed the monthly minimum commit  we recognize revenue for such excess in the period of the usage 
for annual or other non monthly period revenue commitments  we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer s actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof 
we typically charge the customer an installation fee when the services are first activated 
the installation fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the customer arrangement 
we also derive revenue from campaigns  services and events sold as discrete  non recurring events or based solely on usage 
for these services  we recognize revenue after an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the fee is fixed or determinable  the event or usage has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 

table of contents we have on occasion entered into multi element arrangements 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
specifically  this guidance amends the criteria in subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements subtopic  for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c management s best estimate 
this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
during the third quarter of  we early adopted asu with such adoption being effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after january  the impact of adoption was not material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the fasb also issued asu  software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
asu changes revenue recognition for tangible products containing software and hardware elements 
specifically  tangible products containing software and hardware that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are scoped out of the existing software revenue recognition guidance and will be accounted for under the multiple element arrangements revenue recognition guidance under asu in the third quarter of in conjunction with the adoption of asu  we early adopted asu with such adoption being effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after january  we did not enter into or modify any arrangements falling under the scope of asu during the year ended december   and accordingly the impact of adoption was not material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
prior to the adoption of asu effective january   when we entered into multiple element arrangements  each element was accounted for separately over its respective service period or at the time of delivery  provided that there was objective evidence of fair value for the separate elements 
objective evidence of fair value includes the price charged for the element when sold separately 
if the fair value of each element could not be objectively determined  the total value of the arrangement was recognized ratably over the entire service period to the extent that all services have begun to be provided  and other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists of costs related to the delivery of services  as well as the depreciation costs associated with our network 
costs related to the delivery of our services include fees for transit bandwidth provided by network operators  fees paid for the use of private line capacity for our backbone and metro fiber rings to inter connect our delivery zones  fees paid for co location services  which are the housing  electric and cooling of servers and other equipment in third party data centers  fees paid for non settlement free peering and connection to internet service provider networks  network operations and cloud based services employee costs  including share based compensation expense  and costs associated with third party software licenses 
we enter into contracts with third party network and data center providers  with terms typically ranging from several months to several years 
our contracts related to transit bandwidth provided by network operators 
table of contents generally commit us to pay either a fixed monthly fee or monthly fees plus additional fees for bandwidth usage above a contracted level 
in january and september  we entered into multi year arrangements with a telecommunications provider for additional bandwidth and backbone capacity 
the agreements required us to make advanced payments for future services to be received 
our recently amended master contract with global crossing provides for the use of private lines of varying capacity for our backbone 
the amended agreement provides for added capacity for a year term  and includes a substantial prepayment of fees and charges 
in addition to purchasing services from communications providers  we connect directly to over broadband internet service providers  or isps  generally without either party paying the other 
this industry practice  known as settlement free peering  benefits us by allowing us to place content objects directly on user access networks  which helps us provide higher performance delivery for our customers and eliminate paying transit bandwidth fees to network operators 
this practice also benefits the isp and its customers by allowing them to receive improved content delivery through our local servers and eliminate cost of transit bandwidth associated with delivery receipt of the traffic 
we do not consider these relationships to represent the culmination of an earnings process 
accordingly  we do not recognize as revenue the value to the isps associated with the use of our servers nor do we recognize as expense the value of the bandwidth received at discounted or no cost 
these peering relationships are mutually beneficial and are not contractual commitments 
in addition to settlement free peering  we incur costs for non settlement free peering as well as costs associated with connecting to the internet service providers 
during  we continued to reduce our network transit bandwidth delivery costs per gigabyte transferred by entering into new supplier contracts with lower pricing and amending existing contracts to take advantage of price reductions from our existing suppliers associated with higher purchase commitments 
however  due to increased traffic delivered over our network  our total transit bandwidth delivery costs increased during we anticipate our overall transit bandwidth delivery costs will continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result of expected higher traffic levels  partially offset by continued reductions in bandwidth costs per unit 
we expect that our overall transit bandwidth delivery costs as a percentage of revenue will remain relatively constant in compared to depreciation expense related to our network equipment increased from through due to additional equipment purchases each year 
during and depreciation expense related to our network equipment decreased from the prior year 
we anticipate depreciation expense related to our network equipment will increase in compared to in absolute dollars and will remain consistent with as a percentage of revenue 
in total  we believe our cost of revenue will increase in in absolute dollars and will decrease slightly compared to as a percentage of revenue 
each year we expect to deliver more traffic on our network  which would result in higher transit bandwidth delivery cost associated with the increased traffic  increased rack and co location costs and costs associated with our increases in cloud based services 
additionally  we expect an increase in payroll and payroll related costs  as we continue to make investments in our network to service our expanding customer base as well as our increases in cloud based services 
while we expect an increase in absolute dollars  we expect cost of revenue to decrease as a percentage of revenue 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of the following components payroll  share based compensation and other related costs  including related expenses for executive  finance  legal  business applications  internal network management  human resources and other administrative personnel  fees for professional services and litigation expenses  rent and other facility related expenditures for leased properties  the provision for doubtful accounts  and non income related taxes 

table of contents we expect our general and administrative expense in to remain consistent with in absolute dollars and to decrease as a percentage of revenue 
during  we expect to see increased salaries and related employee cost  as well as increased facility costs 
these increases will be off set by lower litigation costs and reduced professional fees 
in and in the longer term  we expect our general and administrative expense to decrease as a percentage of revenue as our costs are expected to grow slower than our top line revenue 
we expect that share based compensation expense will increase slightly in sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense consists primarily of payroll and related costs  including share based compensation expense and commissions and other variable compensation for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and service support functions  professional fees consultants and recruiting fees  travel and travel related expenses as well as advertising and promotional expenses 
we anticipate our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in in absolute dollars and will decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in absolute dollars is due to an expected increase in salaries and related employee costs for our sales and marketing personnel  increased commissions on higher forecast sales  and an increase in marketing costs such as advertising and other lead generating activities 
we expect that share based compensation expense will increase in research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of payroll and related costs and share based compensation expense associated with the design  development  testing and certification of the software  hardware and network architecture of our cdn and our other value added service products 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we anticipate our research and development expenses will increase in in absolute dollars and increase as a percentage of revenue as we continue to make investments in our core technology and refinements to our other service offerings 
we expect increased payroll and related employee costs associated with continued hiring of research and development personnel  as well as increased professional fees for outside services 
we expect that share based compensation expense will increase slightly in non network depreciation and amortization expense non network depreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation on equipment and furnishing used by general administrative  sales and marketing and research and development personnel 
amortization expense consists of amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
we expect that non network depreciation and amortization will increase provision for litigation provision for litigation relates to our accrual for the adverse jury verdict in the akamai litigation 
on february   a jury returned a verdict in favor of akamai in the amount of million plus pre judgment interest estimated to be million that we recorded in during the year ended december   we estimated our revenue from alleged infringing methods totaled approximately of our total revenue 
we recorded a potential additional provision for litigation totaling million  plus additional interest of million  for the year ended december  the total provision for litigation at december  was million 
on april  the court issued its order and memorandum setting aside the adverse jury verdict and ruling that we did not infringe akamai s patent and that we are entitled to judgment as a matter of law 
based upon the court s april  order we have reversed the million provision for litigation previously recorded for this lawsuit as we no longer believe that payment of any amounts represented by the litigation provision is probable 
the court entered final judgment in favor of us 
akamai filed a notice of appeal 
table of contents of the court s decision on may  the court heard arguments by both parties on june  on december  the court of appeals for the federal circuit issued its opinion affirming the district court s entry of judgment in our favor 
on february   akamai filed a motion with the court of appeals for the federal circuit seeking a rehearing and rehearing en banc 
we believe that we do not infringe akamai s patents and will continue to vigorously defend our position 
in light of the favorable ruling from the court of appeals we do not believe that a loss is probable 
therefore  we have made no provision for this lawsuit in our financial statements 
we cannot assure you that this lawsuit ultimately will be resolved in our favor 
our legal and other expenses associated with this case have been significant 
we include these litigation expenses in general and administrative expenses  as reported in our condensed consolidated statement of operations 
we expect that litigation expenses may continue to be significant 
interest expense interest expense includes interest paid on our debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs 
interest income interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest income also includes the realized gains and loss on investments 
we anticipate interest income to increase in as a result of increased average cash balances 
our average cash balance will increase in  primarily due to our follow on offering of our common stock in which we received approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering costs 
other income expense our other income expense consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the re measurement of accounts payable and receivables denominated in a foreign currency  the effect of exchange rates on monetary balance sheet and income statement items and the application of our cost plus model on foreign operations in various countries 
other income expense also includes gains or losses from the disposal of assets 
income tax expense benefit our provision for income taxes is primarily comprised of the tax benefit of a partial release of our valuation allowance related to the eyewonder acquisition  the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  and tax expense from various foreign jurisdictions 
income tax expense depends on the statutory rate in the countries where we operate 
historically  we have primarily been subject to taxation in the united states because we have sold the majority of our services to customers based there 
we continue to expand our operations in locations outside the united states  in which case we are subject to taxation based on the statutory rates in the foreign countries 
our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly 
management periodically evaluates if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
during the year ended december   management performed an assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
as a result of the acquisition of eyewonder  million of net deferred tax liabilities were 
table of contents recorded resulting from the temporary differences generated by the differences between the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired mainly intangible assets such as existing technologies and their corresponding tax bases 
management determined that million of our pre acquisition deferred tax assets that had a full valuation allowance are now more likely than not to be realized as a result of the acquisition by offsetting such deferred tax assets against the million net deferred tax liabilities recorded as of the acquisition date 
therefore  we recorded a tax benefit of million related to the partial release of the related valuation allowance 
for the remaining balance of deferred tax assets  there was sufficient negative evidence as a result of our cumulative losses to conclude that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized  with the exception of deferred tax assets at certain foreign subsidiaries  and we accordingly maintained a valuation allowance of million 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
related to the chors and kiptronic acquisitions  we also have certain taxable temporary differences related to intangible assets that cannot be offset by existing deductible temporary differences resulting in a deferred tax liability of approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and related reserves  useful lives and realizability of long term assets  capitalized software  acquired intangibles  provision for litigation  income and other taxes  the fair value of stock based compensation and other contingent liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results  our future financial statements will be affected 
we define our critical accounting policies as those united states generally accepted accounting principles that require us to make subjective estimates about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles 
our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to continually assess a range of potential outcomes 
revenue recognition we primarily derive revenue from the sale of content delivery network services to customers executing contracts having terms of one year or longer 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly or annual level of usage and provide the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly or annual minimum 
for these services  we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the service has been delivered to the customer  the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
should a customer s usage of our services exceed the monthly minimum commit  we recognize revenue for such excess in the period of the usage 
for annual or other non monthly period revenue commitments  we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer s actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof 
we typically charge the customer an installation fee when the services are first activated 
the installation fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement 
we also derive revenue from campaigns  services and events sold as discrete  non recurring events or based solely on usage 
for 
table of contents these services  we recognize revenue after an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the fee is fixed or determinable  the event or usage has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 
we have on occasion entered into multi element arrangements 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit

this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c management s best estimate 
this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
in the third quarter of  we early adopted asu with such adoption being effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after january  we recognized million of revenue related to a multi element arrangement accounted for in accordance with asu during the year ended december  in october  the fasb also issued asu  software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
asu changes revenue recognition for tangible products containing software and hardware elements 
specifically  tangible products containing software and hardware that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are scoped out of the existing software revenue recognition guidance and will be accounted for under the multiple element arrangements revenue recognition guidance under asu in the third quarter of in conjunction with the adoption of asu  we early adopted asu with such adoption being effective for revenue arrangement entered into or materially modified after january  we did not enter into or modify any arrangements falling under the scope of asu during the year ended december   and accordingly the impact of adoption was not material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
prior to the adoption of asu effective january  we accounted for multiple element arrangements in accordance with subtopic when we entered into such arrangements  each element was accounted for separately over its respective service period or at the time of delivery  provided that there was objective evidence of fair value for the separate elements 
objective evidence of fair value includes the price charged for the element when sold separately 
if the fair value of each element could not be objectively determined  the total value of the arrangement was recognized ratably over the entire service period to the extent that all services have begun to be provided  and other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
if the multi element arrangement included a significant software component  we recognized software license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery occurs  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
if a software license contained an undelivered element  the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the undelivered element is deferred and the revenue recognized once the element is delivered 
the undelivered elements related to these arrangements are primarily software support and professional services 
vsoe of fair value of software support and professional services is based upon hourly rates or fixed fees charged when those services are sold separately 
if vsoe could not be established for all elements to be delivered  we deferred all amounts received under the arrangement and did not begin to recognize revenue until the delivery of the last element of the contract started 
subsequent to commencement of delivery of the last element  we commenced revenue recognition 
amounts to be received under the contract are then included in the amortizable base and recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining term of the arrangement until we have delivered all elements and have no additional performance obligations 
we have certain multi element arrangements as of december  that were entered into prior to the adoption of asu in under these arrangements  we recognized approximately million  million and million  respectively  in revenue for the years ended december   and as of 
table of contents december   we had deferred revenue related to these multi element arrangements of approximately million that will be recognized over the remaining terms of the respective arrangements based on the underlying elements of the arrangements in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 
we also sell services through a reseller channel 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from reseller arrangements is recognized over the term of the contract  based on the reseller s contracted non refundable minimum purchase commitments plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments 
these excess commitments are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 
we record revenue under these agreements on a net or gross basis depending upon the terms of the arrangement 
we typically record revenue gross when we have risk of loss  latitude in establishing price  credit risk and are the primary obligor in the arrangement 
reseller revenue was approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
from time to time  we enter into contracts to sell services to unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies 
if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently  we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor 
for certain non cash arrangements whereby we provide rack space and bandwidth services to several companies in exchange for advertising we record barter revenue and expense if the services are objectively measurable 
the various types of advertising include radio  website  print and signage 
we recorded barter revenue and corresponding expense of approximately   and  respectively  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties 
revenue for these transactions is recorded when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service  such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service 
if these conditions are present  we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
at the inception of a customer contract for service  we make an assessment as to that customer s ability to pay for the services provided 
if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense or deferred revenue for all of that customer s unpaid invoices and ceases recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received 
accounts receivable and related reserves trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest 
we record reserves as a reduction of our accounts receivable balance 
estimates are used in determining these reserves 
we calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts using the aging of the accounts receivable method 
under this method  the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a calculation that uses our aging of accounts receivable and applies a reserve percentage to the specific age of the receivable to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts 
these estimates could change significantly if our customers financial condition changes or if the economy in general deteriorates 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers 
if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for current services provided  any future services provided to that customer will result in the deferral of revenue until payment is made or we determine payment is reasonably assured 
in addition  we record a reserve for service credits 
reserves for service credits are measured based on an analysis of credits to be issued after the month of billing related to management s estimate of the resolution of customer disputes and billing adjustments 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
share based compensation we account for our share based compensation awards using the fair value method 
the grant date fair value was determined using the black scholes merton pricing model 
the black scholes merton valuation calculation 
table of contents requires us to make key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
the weighted average expected term for stock options granted was calculated using the simplified method 
the simplified method defines the expected term as the average of the contractual term and the vesting period of the stock option 
we have estimated the volatility rates used as inputs to the model based on our volatility rate as a publicly traded company and an analysis of the most similar public companies for which we have data 
we have used judgment in selecting these companies  as well as in evaluating the available historical volatility data for these companies 
we develop an estimate of the number of share based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover 
annual changes in the estimated forfeiture rate may have a significant effect on share based payments expense  as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after january  is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
the risk free rate is based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend yield 
we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term  volatility and forfeiture rate related to our own share based awards on a prospective basis  and in incorporating these factors into the model 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little share based compensation cost 
we recognize share based compensation expense using the straight line attribution method 
we also estimate when and if performance based awards will be earned 
if an award is not considered probable of being earned  no amount of stock based compensation is recognized 
if the award is deemed probable of being earned  related compensation expense is recorded over the estimated service period 
to the extent our estimates of awards considered probable of being earned changes  the amount of stock based compensation recognized will also change 
we recorded share based compensation expense related to stock options  restricted stock and rsus of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
unrecognized share based compensation expense totaled million at december  based on current outstanding stock options and restricted stock units  of which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 
we expect to amortize million during  million in and the remainder thereafter of the unrecognized share based compensation at december  based upon the scheduled vesting of the options and restricted stock units outstanding at that time 
we expect our share based payments expense to increase in and potentially to increase thereafter as we grant additional stock options and restricted stock awards 
contingencies we record contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against us  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
with regard to our litigation with akamai  during our financial statement close process for the year ended december   we evaluated if additional accrual amounts were required at each reporting period 
we would record additional accrual amounts to the extent we determine amounts are probable of being paid and also reasonably estimable 
on april  the court issued its order and memorandum setting aside the adverse jury verdict and ruling that we did not infringe akamai s patent and that we are entitled to judgment 
table of contents as a matter of law 
based upon the court s april  order we have reversed the million provision for litigation previously recorded for this lawsuit as we no longer believe that payment of any amounts represented by the litigation provision is probable 
the court entered final judgment in our favor 
akamai filed a notice of appeal of the court s decision on may  the court heard arguments by both parties on june  on december  the court of appeals for the federal circuit issued its opinion affirming the district court s entry of judgment in our favor 
on february   akamai filed a motion with the court of appeals for the federal circuit seeking a rehearing and rehearing en banc 
we believe that we do not infringe akamai s patents and will continue to vigorously defend our position 
in light of the favorable ruling from the court of appeals we do not believe that a loss is probable 
therefore  we have made no provision for this lawsuit in our financial statements 
we cannot assure you that this lawsuit ultimately will be resolved in our favor 
contingent consideration contingent consideration is included in other current liabilities or as a component of equity on our consolidated balance sheet depending upon characteristics of the obligation 
in connection with certain of our acquisitions  additional contingent considerations may be earned in the future by the selling entity upon completion of certain financial milestones 
we record a liability or equity that is recognized on the acquisition date for an estimate of the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration based on the probability of achieving the milestones and the probability weighted discount on cash flows 
any change in the fair value of contingent milestone consideration subsequent to the acquisition date is recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
contingent consideration classified as a liability is re measured to fair value each reporting period until the contingency is resolved 
the changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
contingent consideration classified as equity is not re measured 
deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
asc states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
as a result of our recent cumulative losses  we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes in the period of such realization 
we adopted the provisions of asc formerly fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on january   which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the standard provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of the standard and in subsequent periods 
this interpretation also provides guidance on measurement  de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the adoption of the standard did not result in the recognition of an adjustment for the cumulative effect of adoption of a new accounting principle 
the unrecognized tax benefit decreased from january  to december  we anticipate that our unrecognized tax benefits will continue to decrease within twelve months of the reporting date  as a result of settling potential tax liabilities in certain foreign jurisdictions 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision 
as of december   we had an interest and penalties accrual related to unrecognized tax benefits of  which decreased  during 
table of contents our effective tax rate is influenced by the recognition of tax positions pursuant to the more likely than not standard that such positions will be sustained by the taxing authority 
in addition  other factors such as changes in tax laws  rulings by taxing authorities and court decisions  and significant changes in our operations through acquisitions or divestitures can have a material impact on the effective tax rate 
differences between our estimated and actual effective income tax rates and related liabilities are recorded in the period they become known 
we conduct business in various foreign countries 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in multiple locations  and the calculation of our foreign tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
we have subjected the profits of certain foreign subsidiaries to united states tax 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for united states or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities

cash used due to changes in operating assets and liabilities was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease in usage of million 
the change relates primarily to greater cash usage during the year ended december  related primarily to increases in prepaid expenses and other current and long term assets associated with advanced payments for backbone services with a telecommunications provider  a decrease in accounts payable related to the timing of payments  a decrease in other current liabilities primarily due to the payment of certain accrued legal fees and cost of sales accruals  and a decrease in deferred revenue resulting from revenue recognition  offset by cash generated from a decrease in accounts receivable due to collection efforts during this period

the decrease in accounts receivable is the result of increased focus on both the quality of our customers and our continued collection efforts 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets is primarily comprised of the current and long term portion of advanced payments made to a telecommunications provider 
the decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities primarily resulted from decreased legal activity and timing of payments for accounts payable 
the decrease in deferred revenue primarily resulted from the amortization of our multi element arrangement 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may not be sufficient to cover new purchases of property and equipment during and potential litigation expenses associated with patent litigation 
the timing and amount of future working capital changes and our ability to manage our days sales outstanding will also affect the future amount of cash used in or provided by operating activities

changes in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in  among other things  working capital items such as deferred revenues  accounts payable  accounts receivable  accrued provision for litigation and various accrued expenses  as well as changes in our capital and financial structure due to debt repurchases and issuances  stock option exercises  sales of equity investments and similar events 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change  or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise  we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities

table of contents use of non gaap financial measures to evaluate our business  we consider and use non gaap net income loss and adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of operating performance 
these measures include the same adjustments that management takes into account when it reviews and assesses operating performance on a period to period basis 
we consider non gaap net income loss to be an important indicator of overall business performance because it allows us to illustrate the impact of the effects of share based compensation  litigation expenses  provision for litigation  amortization of intangibles and acquisition related expenses 
we define ebitda as gaap net income loss before interest income  interest expense  other income and expense  provision for income taxes and  depreciation and amortization 
we believe that ebitda provides a useful metric to investors to compare us with other companies within our industry and across industries 
we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda adjusted for operational expenses that we do not consider reflective of our ongoing operations 
we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to review and assess operating performance 
we also believe use of adjusted ebitda facilitates investors use of operating performance comparisons from period to period 
in addition  it should be noted that our performance based executive officer bonus structure is tied closely to our performance as measured in part by certain non gaap financial measures 
in our february  earnings press release  as furnished on form k  we included non gaap net income loss  ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
the terms non gaap net income loss  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not defined under united states generally accepted accounting principles  or united states gaap  and are not measures of operating income  operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with united states gaap 
our non gaap net income loss  ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools  and when assessing our operating performance  non gaap net income loss  ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for net income loss or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with united states gaap 
some of these limitations include  but are not limited to ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  they do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  they do not reflect the cash requirements necessary for litigation costs  they do not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debt that we may incur  they do not reflect income taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will be replaced sometime in the future  and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  while share based compensation is a component of operating expense  the impact on our financial statements compared to other companies can vary significantly due to such factors as the assumed life of the options and the assumed volatility of our common stock  and other companies may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as comparative measures 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using non gaap net income loss and adjusted ebitda only as supplemental support for management s analysis of business performance 
non gaap net income loss  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are calculated as follows for the periods presented

the update provides that sec filers  as defined in asu  are no longer required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in originally issued and revised financial statements

under asu  when the carrying amount of a reporting unit is zero or negative an entity must assume that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  perform an additional test to determine whether goodwill has been impaired and 
table of contents calculate the amount of that impairment 
the modifications to asc topic resulting from the issuance of asu are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those years 
early adoption is not permitted 
the adoption of asu is not expected to have an impact on the financial statements of the company 
in december  the fasb issued asu business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations asu

asu is effective prospectively for material either on an individual or aggregate basis business combinations entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after december  with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt and investment portfolio 
in our investment portfolio  we do not use derivative financial instruments 
our investments are primarily with our commercial and investment banks and  by policy  we limit the amount of risk by investing primarily in money market funds  united states treasury obligations  high quality corporate and municipal obligations and certificates of deposit 
we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income  operating results or liquidity 
foreign currency risk a large portion of our customer agreements are denominated in us dollars  however  we may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates with respect to customer agreements with certain of our international customers 
additionally  because we have operations in europe and asia we may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates with respect to certain operating expenses and cash flows 
we may continue to expand our operations globally and increase our revenues related to customers in foreign locations which may increase our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations 
at this time  we do not have any foreign currency hedge contracts 
inflation risk we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations
