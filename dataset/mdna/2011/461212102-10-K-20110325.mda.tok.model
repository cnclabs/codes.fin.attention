item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy to expand our business internationally 
the company plans to expand sales to canadian customers and is exploring other international market opportunities for its brands 
such expansion may require significant management attention and financial resources and may not produce desired levels of revenue 
international business is subject to inherent risks  including longer accounts receivable collection cycles  difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographical areas  difficulties enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights  fluctuations in local economic  market and political conditions  compliance requirements with us and foreign export regulations  potential adverse tax consequences and currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability claims that may be brought against us or any product recalls we have to make 
as a manufacturer and marketer of food products  the company may be subjected to various product liability claims 
the product liability and product recall insurance maintained by the company may not be adequate to cover any loss or exposure for product liability  and such insurance may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to the company 
any product liability claim not fully covered by insurance  as well as any adverse publicity from a product liability claim or product recall  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
newly adopted governmental regulations could increase our costs or liabilities or impact the sale of our products 
the food industry is highly regulated and subject to change 
new or increased government regulation of the food industry  including areas related to production processes  product quality  packaging  labeling  marketing  storage and distribution  and labor unions  could adversely impact the company s operating results by increasing production costs or restricting methods of operation and distribution 
these regulations may address food industry or society factors  such as obesity  nutritional concerns and diet trends 
sales of the company s products could be materially and adversely affected if new laws or regulations are passed that require the company to alter the taste or composition of its products or impose other obligations on the company 
we do not own the patents for the technology we use to manufacture our tgi friday s  burger king tm and tato skins brand products 
the company licenses technology from a third party in connection with the manufacture of its tgi friday s  burger king tm and tato skins brand products and has a royalty bearing  exclusive right license to use the technology necessary to produce these products in the united states  canada  and mexico until such time the parties mutually agree to terminate the agreement 
even though the patents for this technology expired december   in consideration for the use of this technology  the company is required to make royalty payments to the third party on sales of products manufactured utilizing the technology until such termination date 
since these patents expired  we no longer have exclusive rights to this technology and  as a result  may face additional competition that could adversely affect our revenues 
moreover  competitors of the company  certain of which may have significantly greater resources than the company  may utilize different technology in the manufacture of products that are similar to those currently manufactured  or that may in the future be manufactured  by the company 
the entry of any such products into the marketplace could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales of tgi friday s  burger king tm and tato skins brand products  as well as any such future products 

table of contents the majority of our revenues are derived from a limited number of food brands 
the company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a limited number of snack food brands 
for the year ended december   of the company s net revenues were attributable to the tgi friday s brand products  the boulder canyontm natural foods brand products and rader farms brand products 
a decrease in the popularity of these brands during any year could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
any impact to a licensed brand s reputation could also lead to an impact on the company s other snack food products associated with that brand 
decreased sales from any one of our key food brands without a corresponding increase in sales from other existing or newly introduced products would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
we depend on a license agreement for the right to sell our tgi friday s brand 
for the year ended december   of the company s net revenues were attributable to the tgi friday s brand products  which are manufactured and sold by the company pursuant to a license agreement by and between the company and tgi friday s inc that expires in pursuant to the license agreement  the company is subject to various requirements and conditions including  without limitation  minimum sales targets 
the failure of the company to comply with certain of such requirements and conditions could result in the early termination of the license agreement by tgi friday s inc any termination of the tgi friday s license agreement  whether at the expiration of its term or prior thereto  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the loss of one of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
costco accounted for of the company s net revenues  with the remainder of the company s net revenues being derived from sales to a limited number of additional customers  either grocery chains or regional distributors  none of which individually accounted for more than of the company s revenues for a decision by any major customer to cease or substantially reduce its purchases could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the loss of certain key employees could adversely affect our business 
the company s success is dependent in large part upon the abilities of its executive officers  including terry mcdaniel  chief executive officer  and steve weinberger  chief financial officer 
the company s business strategy will challenge its executive officers  and the inability of such officers to perform their duties or the inability of the company to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect upon the company s operating results 
risks related to the snack business we may not be able to compete successfully in our highly competitive industry 
the market for snack foods  such as those sold by us  including potato chips and meat snacks  is large and intensely competitive 
competitive factors in the snack food industry include product quality and taste  brand awareness among consumers  access to supermarket shelf space  price  advertising and promotion  variety of snacks offered  nutritional content  product packaging and package design 
the company competes in that market principally on the basis of product taste and quality 
the snack food industry is dominated by large food companies  including frito lay  inc  a subsidiary of pepsico  inc  procter and gamble  general mills and others which have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company and sell brands that are more widely recognized than are the company s products 
numerous other companies that are actual or potential competitors of the company  many with greater financial and other resources including more employees and more extensive facilities than the company  offer products similar to those of the company 
in addition  many of such competitors offer a wider range of products than that offered by the company 
local or regional markets often have significant smaller competitors  many of whom offer products similar to those of the company 
with expansion of company operations into new markets  the company has and will continue to encounter significant competition from national  regional and local competitors that may be greater than that encountered by the company in its existing markets 
in addition  such competitors may challenge the company s position in its existing markets 
unavailability of our necessary supplies  at reasonable prices  could adversely affect our operations 
the company s manufacturing costs are subject to fluctuations in the prices of potatoes  potato flakes  wheat flour  corn and oil as well as other ingredients of the company s products 
potatoes  potato flakes  wheat flour and corn are widely available year 
table of contents round  and the company uses a variety of oils in the production of its products 
nonetheless  the company is dependent on its suppliers to provide the company with products and ingredients in adequate supply and on a timely basis 
the failure of certain suppliers to meet the company s performance specifications  quality standards or delivery schedules could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
to the extent that product ingredients become scarce  substantially increase in price  or become unavailable or unavailable on commercially attractive terms  the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
from time to time  the company may lock in prices for raw materials  such as oils  as it deems appropriate  and such strategies may result in the company paying prices for raw materials that are above market at the time of purchase 
we may incur substantial costs in order to market our snacks 
successful marketing of snack products generally depends upon obtaining adequate retail shelf space for product display  particularly in supermarkets 
frequently  food manufacturers and distributors  such as the company  incur additional costs in order to obtain additional shelf space 
whether or not the company incurs such costs in a particular market is dependent upon a number of factors  including demand for the company s products  relative availability of shelf space and general competitive conditions 
the company may incur significant shelf space or other promotional costs as a necessary condition of entering into competition or maintaining market share in particular markets or stores 
if incurred  such costs may have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
our business may be adversely affected by oversupply of snack products at the wholesale and retail levels and seasonal fluctuations 
profitability in the food product industry is subject to oversupply of certain snack products at the wholesale and retail levels  which can result in our products going out of date before they are sold 
the snack products industry is also seasonal 
consumers tend to purchase our products at higher levels during the major summer holidays and also at times surrounding the major sporting events throughout the year 
consumers also tend to purchase fresh berries while in season and therefore we see a decline in frozen berry revenue in the summer months 
any of these seasonal effects may result in an oversupply or undersupply of our products 
additionally  we may face seasonal price increases for raw materials 
such seasonal costs could materially and adversely affect our operating results in any given quarter 
we may not be able to respond successfully to shifting consumer tastes 
consumer preferences for snack foods are continually changing and are extremely difficult to predict 
the company s success depends in part on timely responding to current market trends and anticipating changing consumer tastes and dietary habits by developing and licensing new products and entering new markets 
the failure to adequately address changing consumer preferences could result in reduced demand for the company s products and have a material adverse affect the company s operating results

adverse changes in weather conditions and natural disasters  such as earthquakes  droughts  extreme cold or pestilence  may affect the planting  growing and delivery of crops  reduce sales stock  interrupt distribution  and have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our competitors may be affected differently by such weather conditions and natural disasters depending on the location of their supplies or operations 
revenues are derived from one brand  the loss or impairment of this brand may adversely effect operating results 
rader farms derives the majority of its revenue from the sales of one brand 
in  of the company s net revenues were attributable to the berry products segment 
a decrease in the popularity of frozen berries during any year could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
unavailability of purchased berries  at reasonable prices  could adversely affect operations 
the company s manufacturing costs are subject to fluctuations in the prices of certain commodity prices 
berries are not readily available year round  therefore  the company uses an individual quick frozen iqf technique to freeze the berries harvested for use during the year to meet processing demands 
in addition to freezing our own home grown berries  we also purchase a significant amount of berries from outside suppliers to meet customer demands
