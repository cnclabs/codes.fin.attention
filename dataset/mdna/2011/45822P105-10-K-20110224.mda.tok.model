compared with integrys energy group recognized net income attributed to common shareholders of million diluted earnings per share in compared with a net loss attributed to common shareholders of million net loss per share in the primary driver of the million increase in earnings was an after tax noncash goodwill impairment loss of million recorded in  compared with no goodwill impairment losses in other factors contributing to the increase were the combined approximate million after tax positive impact on margins of electric and natural gas distribution rate increases effective in  and a million after tax reduction in restructuring expenses year over year 
these increases in earnings were partially offset by after tax impairment charges of million in related to three natural gas fired generation plants at integrys energy services 
compared with integrys energy group recognized a net loss attributed to common shareholders of million net loss per share in compared with net income attributed to common shareholders of million diluted earnings per share in the primary drivers of the million decrease in earnings were a million after tax year over year increase in noncash goodwill impairment losses  million of after tax restructuring charges recorded in  and million of after tax net losses on dispositions in related to the integrys energy services strategy change 
these decreases in earnings were partially offset by a million after tax increase in margins at integrys energy services  primarily due to the positive year over year impact of noncash inventory valuation adjustments recorded in prior periods  partially offset by noncash accounting losses in versus noncash accounting gains in due to derivative fair value adjustments

residential customer volumes decreased  which integrys energy group attributes to energy conservation  efficiency efforts  and general economic conditions 
in addition  some former mgu residential and small commercial and industrial retail customers have become transportation customers under a michigan customer choice program  which resulted in reduced revenues of approximately million in related to the pass through of the cost of natural gas but had no impact on margins 
these decreases were partially offset by a year over year net increase in commercial and industrial sales volumes for both retail and transportation customers  driven by certain transportation customers of merc and mgu 
an approximate million decrease as a result of warmer year over year weather during the heating season  as evidenced by the decrease in average heating degree days 
partially offsetting these decreases was the approximate million positive year over year impact of decoupling mechanisms for residential  small commercial and industrial  and transportation customers 
under decoupling  certain of integrys energy group regulated natural gas utilities are allowed to defer the difference between the actual and rate case authorized delivery charge components of margin from certain customers and adjust future rates in accordance with rules applicable to each jurisdiction 
the decoupling mechanism for wps natural gas utility includes an annual million cap for the deferral of any excess or shortfall from the rate case authorized margin 
this cap was reached in the first quarter of but was not reached in an approximate million decrease in revenues as a result of an approximate year over year decrease in the average per unit cost of natural gas sold 
for all of integrys energy group regulated natural gas utilities  prudently incurred natural gas commodity costs are passed directly through to customers in current rates 
an approximate million net decrease in revenues driven by lower recovery of approximately million of environmental cleanup expenditures related to former manufactured gas plant sites  partially offset by an approximate million increase related to recoveries received in under the pgl and nsg bad debt riders 
these amounts were offset by a net decrease in operating and maintenance expense resulting from lower net amortization of the related regulatory assets and  therefore  had no impact on earnings 
recoveries under these riders represent net billings to customers of the excess or deficiency of actual and bad debt expense over bad debt expense reflected in utility rates during those same periods 
see note  regulatory environment  for more information on the pgl and nsg bad debt riders 
partially offsetting these decreases was the approximate million positive impact of natural gas distribution rate increases 
these rate increases were necessary  in part  to recover higher operating expenses as discussed below 
see note  regulatory environment  for more information on these rate increases 
the rate increases at pgl and nsg had an approximate million positive impact on revenues 
the rate increase at wps had an approximate million positive impact on revenues 
the rate increase at mgu had an approximate million positive impact on revenues 
a rate increase at merc related to its conservation improvement program had an approximate million positive impact on revenues 
this amount is offset by a corresponding increase in operating and maintenance expense and  therefore  had no impact on earnings 
margins regulated natural gas utility segment margins increased million year over year  driven by the approximate million positive impact of the rate increases  partially offset by an approximate million decrease in margins resulting from lower natural gas throughput volumes  resulting from an approximate million decrease related to warmer year over year weather during the heating season 
an approximate million decrease related to lower weather normalized volumes  primarily attributed to residential customer conservation  efficiency efforts  and general economic conditions  partially offset by the favorable net impact of increased commercial and industrial sales volumes for certain retail and transportation customers of merc and mgu 
partially offsetting these decreases was the approximate million positive impact from decoupling mechanisms in place at certain of integrys energy group regulated natural gas utilities 
an approximate million net decrease in margins driven by lower recovery of environmental cleanup expenditures related to former manufactured gas plant sites  partially offset by an increase in margins related to recoveries received under the pgl and nsg bad debt riders 
these amounts were offset by a net decrease in operating and maintenance expense resulting from lower net amortization of the related regulatory assets and  therefore  had no impact on earnings 
operating income loss operating income at the regulated natural gas utility segment increased million year over year 
this increase was primarily driven by the positive year over year impact of a million noncash goodwill impairment loss that was recorded in the first quarter of also contributing to the increase was the million increase in the natural gas margins discussed above  partially offset by a million increase in other operating expenses 
see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  for information related to the goodwill impairment loss recorded in the million year over year increase in other operating expenses primarily related to a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  primarily due to the icc rate order for pgl and nsg  effective january   which allows earlier recovery in rates for net dismantling costs by including them as a component of depreciation rates applied to natural gas distribution assets 
the increase also includes a million write off of mgu assets for which rate recovery is currently being contested 
a million increase in expenses related to energy conservation programs and enhanced efficiency initiatives 
a million increase in employee benefit costs  primarily driven by an increase in other postretirement benefit costs 
a million increase in asset usage charges from ibs related to implementation of both a work asset management system for natural gas operations and a newer version of an enterprise resource planning system for finance and supply chain services 
a million increase in stock based compensation expense 
see note  stock based compensation  for more information 
these increases were partially offset by an approximate million net decrease due to approximately million of lower amortization of the regulatory asset related to environmental cleanup expenditures for manufactured gas plant sites  partially offset by approximately million of amortization related to the regulatory assets recorded as a result of the pgl and nsg bad debt riders 
this net decrease was passed through to customers in rates and  therefore  had no impact on earnings 
a million decrease in restructuring expenses recorded in related to a reduction in workforce 
see note  restructuring expense  for more information 
a million decrease in labor costs as a result of the reduction in workforce and company wide furloughs implemented as a part of previously announced cost management efforts 
compared with revenues regulated natural gas utility segment revenues decreased million  driven by an approximate million decrease in revenues as a result of an approximate decrease in the average per unit cost of natural gas sold by the regulated natural gas utilities during compared with for all of integrys energy group regulated natural gas utilities  prudently incurred natural gas commodity costs are passed directly through to customers in current rates 
an approximate million decrease in revenues as a result of lower year over year natural gas throughput volumes  driven by an approximate million decrease related to lower weather normalized volumes  including residential customer volumes  resulting from customer conservation and efficiency efforts 
lower volumes were also driven by decreased commercial and industrial customer volumes resulting from reduced demand related to changes in customers plant operations and a decline in customer base at pgl and mgu  both of which integrys energy group attributed to the general economic slowdown 
an approximate million decrease as a result of warmer year over year weather during the heating season as indicated by the decrease in average heating degree days 
an approximate million decrease related to a reduction in volumes sold to the electric utility segment driven by the availability of lower cost power from miso  resulting in a decrease in the need for the electric utility to run its natural gas fired peaking generation units 
this decrease in revenues was partially offset by the million positive impact of decoupling mechanisms that were first effective for pgl and nsg on march   and for wps on january  under decoupling  these utilities are allowed to defer the difference between the actual and rate case authorized delivery charge components of margin from certain customers and adjust future rates in accordance with rules applicable to each jurisdiction 
an approximate million year over year net decrease in revenues from lower recovery of environmental cleanup expenditures at pgl and nsg related to former manufactured gas plant sites  partially offset by higher recovery of eep expenses 
the eep program was established in the pgl and nsg rate cases and is designed to encourage energy efficiency initiatives 
the decrease in revenues was partially offset by the approximate million year over year net positive impact of natural gas distribution rate cases and changes in rate design at the regulated natural gas utilities 
see note  regulatory environment  for more information on these rate cases 
effective january   mgu received a final rate order from the mpsc for a natural gas distribution rate increase 
on june   merc received a final rate order granting a natural gas distribution rate increase 
prior to this final order  merc had been granted interim rate relief effective october  together  these rate increases had an approximate million positive impact on revenue 
in  pgl and nsg received the full impact of their natural gas distribution rate orders  which were effective february   and drove an approximate million increase in revenue year over year 
effective january   the pscw required wps to change its retail natural gas distribution rate design which incorporates higher volumetric rates and lower fixed customer charges 
in  revenue increased approximately million related to this change in rate design 
margins regulated natural gas utility segment margins decreased million  driven by an approximate million year over year decrease in margins resulting from the decrease in natural gas throughput volumes attributed to the negative impact of the general economic slowdown  customer conservation and efficiency efforts  and warmer year over year weather 
this decrease in margins includes the impact of decoupling mechanisms that were first effective for pgl and nsg on march   and for wps on january  the decoupling mechanism for wps natural gas utility includes an annual million cap for the deferral of any excess or shortfall from the rate case authorized margin 
approximately million of additional margin was recognized at wps due to a shortfall from the rate case authorized margin during an approximate million year over year net decrease in margins due to lower recovery of environmental cleanup expenditures at pgl and nsg related to former manufactured gas plant sites  partially offset by an increase in recovery of eep expenses 
this decrease in margin was offset by a net decrease in operating expense from both the amortization of the related regulatory asset and eep expenses and  therefore  had no impact on earnings 
an approximate million year over year decrease in margins at mgu related to an adjustment in the third quarter of for recovery of natural gas costs in a mpsc proceeding 
the decrease in margins was partially offset by the approximate million net positive year over year impact of rate orders and impacts of rate design changes at the regulated natural gas utilities 
operating income loss operating results at the regulated natural gas utility segment decreased million  from operating income of million in  to an operating loss of million in this decrease was primarily driven by a year over year increase in noncash goodwill impairment losses of million and the million decrease in natural gas margin  partially offset by a million decrease in other operating expenses 
see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  for information related to the goodwill impairment losses recorded in and the year over year decrease in other operating expenses primarily related to an approximate million net decrease in amortization of the regulatory asset related to environmental cleanup expenditures of manufactured gas plant sites  partially offset by an increase in eep expenses 
both of these costs were recovered from customers in rates 
a million decrease in bad debt expense driven by the impact lower energy prices had on overall accounts receivable balances and the implementation of bad debt expense tracking mechanisms at pgl  nsg  and mgu 
pgl and nsg elected during the third quarter of  under a new illinois state law  to file for recovery from or refund to customers the difference between actual bad debt expense reported as a component of earnings and the bad debt expense included in utility rates retroactive to january  bad debt expense also decreased as a result of mgu rate order effective january   which established a bad debt expense tracking mechanism that allows for the deferral and subsequent recovery or refund of of the difference between actual bad debt write offs net of recoveries and bad debt expense included in utility rates 
the bad debt mechanism allowed recovery of a portion of the december  accounts receivable reserve representing future bad debt write offs 
the decrease in bad debt expense attributed to the implementation of bad debt expense tracking mechanisms at the natural gas utilities was million 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in employee benefit costs  partially related to an increase in pension expense resulting from negative pension investment returns in  as well as higher health care expenses in restructuring expenses of million related to a reduction in workforce 
see note  restructuring expense  for more information 
a million increase in natural gas maintenance costs  primarily related to increased system inspection and maintenance requirements

an approximate million increase in revenues due to a increase in sales volumes to large commercial and industrial customers at wps  primarily related to changes in the business operations of these customers year over year 
an approximate million increase in revenues due to a increase in sales volumes to residential customers and a increase in sales volumes to small commercial and industrial customers at wps  primarily related to warmer year over year weather during the cooling season as evidenced by the increase in cooling degree days 
an approximate million increase in opportunity sales at wps  made possible by the availability of low cost energy from weston these increases in regulated electric utility segment revenues were partially offset by an approximate million decrease in revenues from wholesale customers at wps  primarily due to lower fuel costs 
fuel costs are passed directly through to wholesale customers in rates 
margins regulated electric utility segment margins increased million year over year  driven by an approximate million increase in margins driven by lower fuel and purchased power costs incurred during as compared with authorized fuel and purchased power cost recovery rates 
the approximate million combined positive impact of retail electric rate increases at both wps and uppco  effective january  an approximate million increase in margins due to a increase in sales volumes to residential customers at wps  primarily related to warmer year over year weather during the cooling season  as evidenced by the increase in cooling degree days 
margins were impacted by the year over year increase in sales volumes because wps reached the annual million electric decoupling cap in the second quarter of and and remained over the cap through the end of both years 
therefore  no additional decoupling deferral was allowed for additional shortfalls from authorized margin for the remainder of both years 
under decoupling  wps is allowed to defer up to the established cap the difference between its actual margin and the rate case authorized margin recognized from residential and small commercial and industrial customers 
an approximate million increase in margins due to a increase in sales volumes to large commercial and industrial customers at wps  primarily related to changes in the business operations of these customers year over year

the primary drivers of the decrease were an approximate million year over year decrease due to lower demand related to changes in commercial and industrial customers plant operations  which integrys energy group attributed mainly to the general economic slowdown 
an approximate million decrease primarily related to cooler year over year weather during the cooling season as evidenced by the decrease in cooling degree days at both wps and uppco 
these decreases in volumes were partially offset by the million impact that decoupling  which went into effect on january   had on wps revenue 
the four year pilot program for electric decoupling has an annual million cap for the deferral of any excess or shortfall from the rate case authorized margin 
this cap was reached during the second quarter of  therefore  no additional decoupling deferral was allowed for additional shortfalls from authorized margin for the second half of the year 
an approximate million year over year reduction in revenues related to refunds due to customers in both and related to wps over collection of fuel costs

a million increase from operations in the texas market 
this increase was a result of the positive year over year impact of lower ancillary service costs compared to the prior year and the effects of hurricane ike in the third quarter of hurricane ike disrupted the electric infrastructure in texas for a period of time  causing some of integrys energy services customers to be without electricity or buy only a fraction of their normal energy usage during that period 
realized wholesale electric margins realized wholesale electric margins increased million year over year 
in general  realized margins are impacted by transaction activity in prior periods  as integrys energy services recognizes realized margin when the contracts actually settle  which typically occurs over a to month period from the time the contract was actually entered into 
in  realized margins benefited from the settlement of contracts that were entered into prior to the implementation of integrys energy services strategy change 
wholesale transactions and structured origination activity were scaled back in conjunction with the global credit crisis in the latter half of and continued to be scaled back with integrys energy services strategy change and ultimate decision to exit its wholesale electric business 
fair value adjustments integrys energy services electric margins from fair value adjustments increased million year over year 
fair value adjustments required under derivative accounting rules primarily relate to derivative electric supply contracts used to economically hedge risks associated with electric sales contracts 
the fair value adjustments recorded in include margin reductions of million related to the settlement of derivative contracts entered into with the purchaser of the canadian electric power portfolio  as discussed in note  dispositions 
natural gas margins realized retail natural gas margins realized retail natural gas margins increased million  due to integrys energy services withdrawal of a significant amount of natural gas during in order to improve its liquidity position  recognizing realized gains on these natural gas storage withdrawals 
also  per unit retail natural gas margins were higher year over year as more recently contracted sales commitments reflect increased business risk and financing costs in the pricing 
offsetting the increase was a decrease in integrys energy services natural gas sales volumes year over year 
integrys energy services significantly reduced the number of natural gas storage transactions entered into as integrys energy group implemented its strategy change for its nonregulated energy services business segment 
realized wholesale natural gas margins realized wholesale natural gas margins decreased million year over year 
wholesale natural gas transactions were scaled back in conjunction with the global credit crisis in the latter half of and integrys energy services strategy change and ultimate decision to exit its wholesale natural gas business 
the reduced activity had a negative impact on realized margins in lower of cost or market inventory adjustments the combination of lower of cost or market inventory write downs and withdrawals of natural gas from storage for which write downs had previously been recorded resulted in a million year over year increase in natural gas margins 
the average market price of natural gas decreased approximately during and decreased approximately during  driving a positive year over year change in natural gas margins of million related to lower of cost or market inventory write downs 
the natural gas withdrawn from storage and sold to customers in had a million lower cost basis as a result of lower of cost or market inventory write downs recorded in prior periods 
fair value adjustments integrys energy services natural gas margins from fair value adjustments decreased million year over year 
fair value adjustments required under derivative accounting rules primarily relate to financial instruments used to economically hedge risks associated with natural gas storage and transportation activity

liquidity and capital resources integrys energy group believes that its cash balances  liquid assets  operating cash flows  access to equity and debt capital markets  and available borrowing capacity provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects 
integrys energy group borrowing costs can be impacted by short term and long term debt ratings assigned by independent credit rating agencies  as well as the market rates for interest 
integrys energy group operating cash flows and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control 
operating cash flows compared with net cash provided by operating activities was million during  compared with  million during the million year over year decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly driven by a million net decrease in cash provided by working capital  driven by a million year over year decrease in cash generated from customer collections  primarily due to the integrys energy services strategy change  as well as lower year over year natural gas prices  which impacted both the regulated natural gas segment and integrys energy services 
a million year over year decrease in cash generated from reduced inventory levels  mainly the result of the withdrawal of a significant amount of natural gas from storage at integrys energy services during in order to improve its liquidity position 
partially offsetting these changes was a million year over year decrease in cash used to pay accounts payable balances  driven by smaller accounts payable balances at integrys energy services as a result of the strategy change  as well as lower year over year natural gas prices

compared with net cash used for financing activities was  million during  compared with net cash provided by financing activities of million during the  million year over year increase in net cash used for financing activities was primarily driven by million of net repayments of short term debt and notes payable in  compared with million of net short term and notes payable borrowings in the repayments in were made possible by the increase in net cash provided by operating activities 
also  as a result of the previously announced strategy change at integrys energy services  fewer structured natural gas loan agreements were entered into in  compared with  resulting in a million year over year decrease in proceeds from the sale of borrowed natural gas 
additionally  integrys energy services had a million year over year increase in the purchase of natural gas to repay structured natural gas loan agreements  many of which were entered into in significant financing activities the quarterly common stock dividend per share in remained the same as in in february  integrys energy group increased its quarterly common stock dividend to cents per share

wps outlook remains stable 
on may   moody revised the outlook for integrys energy group and all of its subsidiaries to stable from negative 
according to moody  the revised outlook reflected a reduced business risk profile driven by the recently completed restructuring of integrys energy services into a smaller segment with significantly reduced collateral requirements 
moody also raised the following ratings of integrys energy group subsidiaries the senior secured debt rating and first mortgage bonds rating of wps were raised from a to aa the senior secured debt ratings of pgl and nsg were raised from a to a according to moody  the upgrade follows the august upgrade of the senior secured ratings of the majority of its investment grade regulated utilities issuers with negative outlooks were excluded from the august upgrade

the table above does not reflect any payments related to the manufactured gas plant remediation liability of million at december   as the amount and timing of payments are uncertain 
integrys energy group anticipates incurring costs annually to remediate these sites  but management believes that any costs incurred for environmental activities relating to former manufactured gas plant operations that are not recoverable through contributions from other entities or from insurance carriers have been prudently incurred and are  therefore  recoverable through rates for wps  mgu  pgl  and nsg 
see note  commitments and contingencies  for more information about environmental liabilities

integrys energy group expects to provide additional capital contributions to atc not included in the above table of approximately million in  million in  and million in all projected capital and investment expenditures are subject to periodic review and may vary significantly from the estimates depending on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  industry restructuring  regulatory constraints and requirements  changes in tax laws and regulations  acquisition and development opportunities  market volatility  and economic trends 
capital resources management exercises discretion regarding the liquidity and capital resource needs of its business segments 
this includes the ability to prioritize the use of capital and debt capacity  to determine cash management policies  to utilize risk management policies to hedge the impact of volatile commodity prices  and to make decisions regarding capital requirements 
integrys energy group plans to meet its capital requirements for the period through primarily through internally generated funds net of forecasted dividend payments and debt and equity financings

other future considerations decoupling in certain jurisdictions  decoupling mechanisms have been implemented  which allow utilities to adjust rates going forward to recover or refund all or a portion of the differences between the actual and authorized margin per customer impact of variations in volumes 
the mechanisms do not adjust for changes in volume resulting from changes in customer count 
decoupling for residential and small commercial and industrial sales was approved by the icc on a four year trial basis for pgl and nsg  effective march  interveners  including the illinois attorney general  oppose decoupling and have appealed the icc approval 
pgl and nsg actively support the icc decision to approve decoupling 
included in their february  rate case filing  pgl and nsg requested that decoupling be approved on a permanent basis 
the pscw approved the implementation of decoupling on a four year trial basis  effective january   for wps natural gas and electric residential and small commercial sales 
this decoupling mechanism includes an annual million cap for electric service and an annual million cap for natural gas service 
decoupling for uppco was approved for all customer groups by the mpsc  effective january  the mpsc granted an order  effective january   approving a decoupling mechanism for mgu as a pilot program which adjusts for the impact on revenues of changes in weather normalized use per customer for residential and small commercial customers  but does not adjust for weather related usage 
in minnesota  merc proposed a decoupling mechanism in its november  general rate case filing

impairment testing integrys energy group performs its required annual goodwill impairment tests each april interim impairment tests are performed between required annual testing dates when impairment indicators are present 
any annual or interim goodwill impairment test could result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss 
see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  for more information on goodwill balances for integrys energy group reporting units at december  see critical accounting policies  goodwill impairment  for more information on the annual goodwill impairment test 
integrys energy group also performs regular asset impairment tests related to other long lived assets  including the portfolio of merchant power plants owned and operated by integrys energy services 
see note  property  plant  and equipment  for more information on integrys energy group impairment losses recorded during climate change the epa began regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the caa in january  by applying the bact requirements associated with the new source review program to new and modified larger greenhouse gas emitters 
technology to remove and sequester greenhouse gas emissions is not commercially available at scale  hence  the epa issued guidance that defines bact in terms of improvements in energy efficiency as opposed to relying on pollution control equipment 
in december  the epa announced its intent to develop new source performance standards for greenhouse gas emissions for new and modified  as well as existing  electric utility steam generating units 
the epa plans to propose standards in and finalize standards in efforts have been initiated to develop state and regional greenhouse gas programs  to create federal legislation to limit carbon dioxide emissions  and to create national or state renewable portfolio standards 
currently there is no applicable federal or state legislation pending that specifically addresses greenhouse gas emissions 
a risk exists that such legislation or regulation will increase the cost of energy 
however  integrys energy group believes the capital expenditures being made at its generation units are appropriate under any reasonable mandatory greenhouse gas program and that future expenditures related to control of greenhouse gas emissions or renewable portfolio standards by its regulated electric utilities will be recoverable in rates 
integrys energy group will continue to monitor and manage potential risks and opportunities associated with future greenhouse gas legislative or regulatory actions 
the majority of integrys energy group generation and distribution facilities are located in the upper midwest region of the united states 
the same is true for the majority of its customers facilities 
the physical risks posed by climate change for these areas are not expected to be significant at this time 
ongoing evaluations will be conducted as more information on the extent of such physical changes becomes available 
property tax assessment on natural gas integrys energy group natural gas retailers  including its five natural gas utilities  purchase storage services from pipeline companies on the pipelines interstate natural gas storage and transmission systems 
once a shipper  such as the subsidiaries of integrys energy group  delivers natural gas to the pipeline system  that specific natural gas cannot be physically traced back to the shipper  and the physical location of that specific natural gas is not ascertainable 
some states tax natural gas as personal property and have recently sought to assess personal property tax obligations against natural gas quantities held as working natural gas in facilities located in their states 
because the pipeline does not have title to the working natural gas inventory in these facilities  the state imposes the tax on the shippers as of the assessment date  based on allocated quantities 
shippers that are being assessed a tax are actively protesting these property tax assessments 
pgl and merc are currently pursuing protests through litigation in texas and kansas  respectively 
federal health care reform in march  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of hcr were signed into law 
hcr contains various provisions that will affect the cost of providing health care coverage to active and retired employees of integrys energy group and their dependents 
although these provisions become effective at various times over the next years  some provisions that affect the cost of providing benefits to retirees were reflected in most notably  there is a provision of hcr that  beginning in  eliminates the tax deduction for employer paid postretirement prescription drug charges to the extent those charges will be offset by the receipt of a federal medicare part d subsidy 
as a result  integrys energy group was required to eliminate a portion of its deferred tax asset related to postretirement benefits 
the total amount of the deferred tax asset that was reduced for the loss of the deduction was million  of which million flowed through to net income as a component of income tax expense  and million was deferred for regulatory recovery at uppco 
integrys energy group is seeking recovery in rates for the income impacts of this tax law change related to regulated utility operations in the majority of its jurisdictions 
if recovery in rates becomes probable  income tax expense would be reduced in that period  but at this time integrys energy group is not able to predict how much will ultimately be recovered in rates 
other provisions of hcr include the elimination of certain annual and lifetime maximum benefits  broadening of plan eligibility requirements  elimination of pre existing condition restrictions  an excise tax on high cost health plans  changes to the medicare part d prescription drug program  and numerous other changes 
integrys energy group began participation in the early retiree reinsurance program that became effective on june  integrys energy group continues to assess the extent to which the provisions of the new law will affect its future health care and related employee benefit plan costs 
wisconsin fuel rules assembly bill ab was signed into law on may  ab streamlines the current fuel rule administered by the pscw 
the current rule results in regulatory lag and hampers the ability of the pscw to respond to rapid changes in fuel costs 
ab provides that the utility will defer any change in approved fuel costs in excess of a percentage set by the pscw 
the new rules will apply to wps s fuel costs 
dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act the dodd frank act was signed into law in july although a few provisions were effective with the passing of the act  the majority of the rules to implement the provisions will be finalized and become effective over the months following the signing of the act 
depending on the final rules  certain provisions of the dodd frank act relating to derivatives could increase capital and or collateral requirements 
final rules for these provisions are expected in the second quarter of integrys energy group is monitoring developments related to this act and their impacts on its future results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
recent tax law changes in january  the taxpayer accountability and budget stabilization act was enacted in illinois 
this act increases the corporate combined income tax rate from to retroactively to january  rates decrease to after and return to after integrys energy group and its subsidiaries will have to adjust deferred taxes to reflect the changes in the tax rate  effective in the first quarter of due to the effects of regulation  and the timing of the february rate filings for pgl and nsg  integrys energy group does not anticipate a material impact on income from this legislation 
in december  president obama signed into law the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization  and job creation act of this act includes tax incentives  such as an extension and increase of bonus depreciation  the extension of the research and experimentation credit  and the extension of treasury grants in lieu of claiming the investment tax credit for certain renewable energy investments 
in september  president obama signed into law the small business jobs act of this act includes tax incentives  such as an extension to bonus depreciation and changes to listed property  that affect integrys energy group 
integrys energy group anticipates that these tax law changes will likely result in million to million of reduced cash payments for taxes during and these incentives may also have the effect of reducing utility rate base and  thus  future earnings relative to prior expectations 
integrys energy group is evaluating the most appropriate manner to deploy the additional cash  which may include  among other things  making incremental contributions to its various employee benefit plans or funding additional capital investments 
illinois manufactured gas plant legislation senate bill sb would require pgl and nsg either to enter into year purchase contracts for manufactured gas produced from an illinois coal and petroleum coke plant to be built on the south side of chicago or to elect to file biennial rate proceedings before the icc in   and the stated mission of this coal to gas project is to use illinois coal and petroleum coke to mass produce manufactured gas and sell its entire offput to the four largest illinois natural gas utilities in equal amounts 
under certain assumptions  the illinois power authority may allocate the offput based on therms sold by these utilities  but no utility would be required to take more than of the total plant offput 
sb is similar legislation for a manufactured gas project to be located in jefferson county  illinois 
it would require pgl and nsg either to enter into year purchase contracts  with the offput of the project allocated among the four largest illinois natural gas utilities based on therms sold  or agree to biennial rate filings for   and both bills were passed by the general assembly and were sent to the governor for signature in january the governor has days to act 
off balance sheet arrangements see note  guarantees  for information regarding guarantees 
critical accounting policies integrys energy group has determined that the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of its financial statements because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain 
integrys energy group management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
risk management activities integrys energy group has entered into contracts that are accounted for as derivatives 
all derivative contracts are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets  unless they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception  which provides that recognition of gains and losses in the consolidated financial statements is not required until the settlement of the contracts 
changes in fair value  except effective portions of derivative instruments designated as hedges or qualifying for regulatory deferral  generally affect net income loss attributed to common shareholders at each financial reporting date until the contracts are ultimately settled 
at december   those derivatives not designated as hedges were primarily commodity contracts used to manage price risk associated with natural gas and electricity purchase and sale activities 
cash flow hedge accounting treatment may be used when integrys energy group enters into contracts to buy or sell a commodity at a fixed price for future delivery to protect future cash flows corresponding with anticipated physical sales or purchases 
in addition  integrys energy group uses cash flow hedge accounting to protect against changes in interest rates 
fair value hedge accounting may be used when integrys energy group holds assets  liabilities  or firm commitments and enters into transactions that hedge the risk of changes in commodity prices or interest rates 
to the extent that the hedging instrument is fully effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged  there is no impact on net income loss attributed to common shareholders prior to settlement of the hedge 
integrys energy group has based its valuations on observable inputs whenever possible 
however  at times  the valuation of certain derivative instruments requires the use of internally developed valuation techniques and or significant unobservable inputs 
these valuations require a significant amount of management judgment and are classified as level measurements 
of the total risk management assets on integrys energy group consolidated balance sheets  million were classified as level measurements 
of the total risk management liabilities  million were classified as level measurements 
integrys energy group believes these valuations represent the fair values of these instruments as of the reporting date  however  the actual amounts realized upon settlement of these instruments could vary materially from the reported amounts due to movements in market prices and changes in the liquidity of certain markets 
as a component of fair value determinations  integrys energy group considers counterparty credit risk including its own credit risk and liquidity risk 
the liquidity component of the fair value determination may be especially subjective when limited liquid market information is available 
changes in the underlying assumptions for the credit and liquidity risk components of fair value at december   would have had the following effects change in risk components effect on fair value of net risk management liabilities at december  millions increase decrease decrease increase these hypothetical changes in fair value would be included in current and long term assets and liabilities from risk management activities on the consolidated balance sheets and as part of nonregulated revenues on the consolidated statements of income  unless the related contracts are designated as cash flow hedges  in which case potential changes would be included in other comprehensive income cash flow hedges on the consolidated statements of common shareholders equity to the extent they are considered effective for offsetting future cash flows of the related hedged transactions 
goodwill impairment integrys energy group reviews goodwill for impairment as required by gaap 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit 
a reporting unit can be an operating segment  or one level below an operating segment  as defined by the segment reporting topic of the fasb asc 
at integrys energy group  goodwill has been assigned to each of the five reporting units that comprise the natural gas utility segment and also to the integrys energy services segment 
the carrying value of goodwill by reporting unit and reportable segment for the year ended december  was millions carrying value of goodwill wps pgl nsg merc mgu total natural gas utility segment integrys energy services balance at december  the goodwill for each of the reporting units is tested for impairment annually on april or more frequently when events or circumstances warrant 
the fair market value of each reporting unit is estimated using certain key assumptions that require significant judgment 
this judgment includes developing cash flow projections including the selection of appropriate returns on equity  long term growth rates  and capital expenditure levels  selecting appropriate discount rates  and identifying relevant market comparables 
impairment test integrys energy group completed its annual goodwill impairment tests for all of its reporting units that carry a goodwill balance as of april  the estimated fair value for the pgl  nsg  merc  and mgu reporting units was determined by using an equal weighting of the income approach and the market approach methodologies 
the income approach was based on discounted cash flows which were derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations 
key assumptions used to determine fair value under the income approach included the cash flow period  terminal values based on a terminal growth rate  and the discount rate 
the discount rate represents the estimated cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a company target capital structure 
the discount rates used in the income approach for pgl  nsg  merc  and mgu ranged from to 
the discount rate used for integrys energy services was 
the terminal growth rates used in the income approach ranged from to 
the market approach for pgl  nsg  merc  and mgu utilized the guideline company method  which calculates valuation multiples based on operating and valuation metrics from publicly traded guideline companies in the regulated natural gas distribution industry 
multiples derived from the guideline companies provided an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for an investment in a similar company 
these multiples were then applied to the appropriate operating metric for pgl  nsg  merc  and mgu to determine indications of fair value 
no impairment was recorded in as a result of these tests 
however  the fair value calculated in the first step of the test for mgu approximated the carrying value of this reporting unit 
therefore  any deterioration of the market related factors used in the impairment analysis could potentially result in a future impairment loss for all or a portion of the million of goodwill recorded at mgu 
the fair value of the wps natural gas utility reporting unit currently exceeds the carrying amount by a significant amount  such that integrys energy group believes wps is unlikely to fail step one of the goodwill impairment test in the foreseeable future 
receivables the regulated natural gas and electric utilities and integrys energy services accrue estimated amounts of revenues for services rendered but not yet billed 
estimated unbilled revenues are calculated using a variety of factors based on customer class or contracted rates 
at december  and  integrys energy group unbilled revenues were million and million  respectively 
any difference between actual revenues and the estimates are recorded in revenue in the next period 
differences historically have not been significant 
pension and other postretirement benefits the costs of providing non contributory defined benefit pension benefits and other postretirement benefits  described in note  employee benefit plans  are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions regarding future experience 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels  and employment periods  the level of contributions made to the plans  and earnings on plan assets 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  and expected health care cost trends 
changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
integrys energy group pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns  as well as changes in general interest rates  may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods 
management believes that such changes in costs would be recovered at the regulated segments through the ratemaking process 
the following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported net periodic pension cost 
each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only

the bonds are generally rated aa with a minimum amount outstanding of million 
from the hypothetical bond portfolios  a single rate is determined that equates the market value of the bonds purchased to the discounted value of the plans expected future benefit payments 
integrys energy group establishes its expected return on asset assumption based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns  as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios 
the assumed long term rate of return was in   and for   and  the actual rates of return on pension plan assets  net of fees  were   and  respectively 
the determination of expected return on qualified plan assets is based on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
cumulative gains and losses in excess of of the greater of the pension or other postretirement benefit obligation or market related value are amortized over the average remaining future service to expected retirement ages 
changes in fair value are recognized over the subsequent five years for plans sponsored by wps  while differences between actual investment returns and the expected return on plan assets are recognized over a five year period for pension plans sponsored by ibs and pec 
because of this method  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are included in market related value 
in selecting assumed health care cost trend rates  past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered

regulatory accounting the electric and natural gas utility segments of integrys energy group follow the guidance under the regulated operations topic of the fasb asc  and the financial statements reflect the effects of the ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating these segments 
certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers  as authorized by integrys energy group regulators 
future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured  and is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness 
management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment  earnings at the electric and natural gas utility segments  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
once approved  the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the rate recovery period 
if recovery or refund of costs is not approved or is no longer deemed probable  these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period income 
the application of the regulated operations topic of the fasb asc would be discontinued if all or a separable portion of integrys energy group electric and natural gas utility segment operations would no longer meet the criteria for application 
assets and liabilities recognized solely due to the actions of rate regulation would no longer be recognized on the balance sheet  but rather classified as an extraordinary item in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurred 
a write off of all of integrys energy group regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at december   would result in a decrease in total assets and a decrease in total liabilities 
the two largest regulatory assets at december   related to environmental remediation costs and unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
a write off of the regulatory asset related to environmental remediation costs at december   would result in a decrease in total assets 
a write off of the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit related regulatory asset at december   would result in a decrease in total assets

tax provision integrys energy group is required to estimate income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which it operates as part of the process of preparing integrys energy group consolidated financial statements 
this process involves estimating actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within integrys energy group consolidated balance sheets 
integrys energy group must also assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income 
to the extent integrys energy group believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance  which is offset by an adjustment to the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income 
uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals requires that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates 
only income tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized 
changes in the unrecognized tax benefits are estimated based on an evaluation of the degree of uncertainty  the nature of an event that could cause a change  and an estimate of the range of reasonably possible changes 
significant management judgment is required in determining integrys energy group provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
the assumptions involved are supported by historical data  reasonable projections  and technical interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions 
significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on integrys energy group financial condition and results of operations 
see note p  summary of significant accounting policies income taxes  and note  income taxes  for a discussion of accounting for income taxes 
impact of inflation integrys energy group financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the statements provide a reasonable  objective  and quantifiable statement of financial results  but generally do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
for integrys energy group regulated operations  to the extent it is not recovering the effects of inflation  it will file rate cases as necessary in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
integrys energy group nonregulated businesses include inflation in forecasted costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks and other significant risks integrys energy group has potential market risk exposure related to commodity price risk including regulatory recovery risk  interest rate risk  and equity return and principal preservation risk 
integrys energy group is also exposed to other significant risks due to the nature of its subsidiaries businesses and the environment in which it operates 
integrys energy group has risk management policies in place to monitor and assist in controlling these risks and may use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures  as further described below 
commodity price risk and regulatory recovery risk utilities the electric utilities of integrys energy group purchase coal  natural gas  and fuel oil for use in power generation 
they also buy power from the miso market at a price that is often reflective of the underlying cost of natural gas used in power generation 
prudent fuel and purchased power costs are recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms by uppco  and by the wholesale electric operations and michigan retail electric operations of wps 
the costs of natural gas used by the natural gas utilities are also generally recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms 
these recovery mechanisms greatly reduce commodity price risk for the utilities 
wps wisconsin retail electric operations do not have a one for one recovery mechanism for price fluctuations 
instead  a fuel window mechanism partially mitigates the year to year price risk 
see note f  summary of significant accounting policies revenue and customer receivables  for more information 
to manage commodity price risk  the regulated utilities enter into contracts of various durations for the purchase and or sale of natural gas  fuel for electric generation  and electricity 
in addition  the electric operations of wps and uppco  and the natural gas operations of wps  pgl  nsg  and merc employ risk management techniques  which include the use of derivative instruments such as swaps  futures  and options 
integrys energy services integrys energy services seeks to reduce market price risk from its generation and energy supply portfolios through the use of various financial and physical instruments 
additionally  integrys energy services uses volume limits and stop loss limits to limit its exposure to commodity price movements 
to measure commodity price risk exposure  integrys energy group employs a number of controls and processes  including a value at risk var analysis of its exposures 
integrys energy services var calculation is utilized to quantify exposure to market risk associated with its open commodity positions primarily natural gas and power positions 
the var calculation excludes the positions created by owning energy assets and associated coal  sulfur dioxide emission allowances  renewable energy credits  and other ancillary fuels 
additionally  financial transmission rights  certain electric ancillary services  and certain portions of long dated natural gas storage and transportation contracts are also excluded from the var calculation 
the capped downside nature of the risks and duration of these positions would result in a var that would not be representative of the actual exposure 
therefore  integrys energy services evaluates the exposures for these types of contracts by assessing the maximum potential loss of the positions  which is either the cost of the physical asset or the fixed demand charges for the contract 
var is a probabilistic approach to quantifying the exposure to market risk 
the var amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from changes in market factors  within a given confidence level  if an instrument or portfolio is held for a specified time period 
in addition to var  integrys energy services employs other risk measurements including mark to market valuations  stress testing  and scenario based testing 
in conjunction with the var analysis  these other risk measurements provide the risk management analysis for integrys energy services risk exposure 
var is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
var has a number of limitations that are important to consider when evaluating the calculation results 
most importantly  var does not represent the maximum potential loss of the portfolio 
price movements outside of the relevant confidence levels can and do occur and may result in losses exceeding the reported var 
large short term price moves can be caused by catastrophic weather events or other drivers of short term supply and demand disruptions 
also  the holding period may not always be an adequate assessment of the timeframe to close out positions 
short term reductions in market liquidity could cause integrys energy services to hold positions open longer than anticipated  resulting in greater than predicted losses 
additionally  there are other risks not captured by the var metric including  but not limited to  the risk of customer and vendor nonperformance and the risks associated with the liquidity in the markets in which integrys energy services transacts 
customer and vendor nonperformance risk could result in bad debt losses  realized and unrealized losses on commodity contracts  or increased supply costs in the event that contractual obligations of counterparties are not met 
market liquidity risk refers to the risk that integrys energy services will not be able to efficiently enter or exit commodity positions 
integrys energy services var is calculated using non discounted positions with a delta normal approximation based on a one day holding period and a confidence level  as well as a ten day holding period and a confidence level 
the delta normal approximation is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio over short time periods  such as one day or ten days  are normally distributed 
integrys energy services var calculation includes financial and physical commodity instruments  such as forwards  futures  swaps  and options  as well as natural gas inventory  natural gas storage  and transportation contracts  to the extent such positions are significant  but excludes the positions mentioned above 
the var for integrys energy services portfolio at a confidence level and a one day holding period is presented in the following table millions as of december average for months ended december high for months ended december low for months ended december the var for integrys energy services portfolio at a confidence level and a ten day holding period is presented in the following table millions as of december average for months ended december high for months ended december low for months ended december the average  high  and low amounts were computed using the var amounts at each of the four quarter ends 
the year over year decrease in var was driven primarily by reduced business size  as a result of integrys energy services strategy change 
interest rate risk integrys energy group is exposed to interest rate risk resulting from its variable rate long term debt and short term borrowings 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by limiting the amount of variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates 
integrys energy group enters into long term fixed rate debt when it is advantageous to do so 
integrys energy group may also enter into derivative financial instruments  such as swaps  to mitigate interest rate exposure 
due to decreases in short term borrowings in  integrys energy group has decreased its exposure to variable interest rates 
based on the variable rate debt of integrys energy group outstanding at december   a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of basis points would have increased annual interest expense by million 
comparatively  based on the variable rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in interest rates of basis points would have increased annual interest expense by million 
this sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates  with no other changes for the remainder of the period 
equity return and principal preservation risk integrys energy group currently funds liabilities related to employee benefits through various external trust funds 
the trust funds are managed by numerous investment managers and hold investments primarily in debt and equity securities 
changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities 
declines in the equity markets or declines in interest rates may result in increased future costs for the plans and require contributions into the plans 
integrys energy group monitors the trust fund portfolio by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain security indices 
most of the employee benefit costs relate to integrys energy group regulated utilities 
as such  the majority of these costs are recovered in customers rates  mitigating most of the equity return and principal preservation risk on these exposures 
also  the likelihood of an increase in the employee benefit obligations  which the investments must fund  has been partially mitigated as a result of certain employee groups no longer being eligible to participate in  or accumulate benefits in  certain pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
specifically  effective january   the defined benefit pension plans were closed to all integrys energy group non union new hires 
effective may   and july   the defined benefit pension plans were closed to new union hires at pgl and nsg  respectively 
effective april   and december   the defined benefit pension plans were closed to new union hires at uppco and wps  respectively 
effective january   the defined benefit pension plans were closed to new local union hires at mgu
