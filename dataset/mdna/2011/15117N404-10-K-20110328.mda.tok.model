item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation for additional information regarding expenditures related to our research and development programs 
fda regulation research and development our research and development activities  pre clinical tests and clinical trials and  ultimately  the manufacturing  marketing and labeling of our products  are subject to extensive regulation by the food and drug administration the fda 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  the public health service act and the regulations promulgated by the fda govern  among other things  the testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising  promotion  import and export of our products 
under these statutes  our heat activated liposomes will be regulated as a new drug 
the steps ordinarily required before such products can be marketed in the us include a pre clinical and clinical studies  b the submission to the fda of an application for  or approval  as an investigational new drug ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence  c adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product  d the submission to the fda of a new drug application nda  and e fda approval of the application  including approval of all product labeling 
pre clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry  formulation and stability  as well as animal studies  to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product 
pre clinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with fda regulations regarding good laboratory practice 
the results of pre clinical tests are submitted to the fda as part of an ind and are reviewed by the fda before the commencement of human clinical trials 
submission of an ind will not necessarily result in fda authorization to commence clinical trials  and the absence of fda objection to an ind does not necessarily mean that the fda will ultimately approve an nda or that a product candidate otherwise will come to market 
clinical trials involve the administration of therapy to humans under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator 
clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices under protocols submitted to the fda as part of an ind 
also  each clinical trial must be approved and conducted under the auspices of an internal review board  or irb  and with patient informed consent 
an irb will consider  among other things  ethical factors  and the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution conducting the clinical trials 
clinical trials are typically conducted in two or three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap 
phase i clinical trials involve the initial introduction of the therapy to a small number of subjects 
phase ii trials are generally larger trials conducted in the target population 
phase ii studies may serve as the pivotal trials  providing the demonstration of safety and effectiveness required for approval 
however  the fda may require additional  post market trials as a condition of approval 
in the case of drugs and biological products  phase ii clinical trials generally are conducted in a target patient population to gather evidence about the pharmacokinetics  safety and biological or clinical efficacy of the drug for specific indications  to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
when a drug or biological compound has shown evidence of efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in phase ii evaluations  phase iii clinical trials are undertaken to serve as the pivotal trials to demonstrate clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population 
in  the company  with the support of the fda  received a special protocol assessment for its phase iii trial  having proceeded to this phase directly from phase i assessment 
there can be no assurance that any of our clinical trials will be completed successfully within any specified time period or at all 
either the fda or we may suspend clinical trials at any time  if the fda  our data monitoring committee  or we conclude that clinical subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or for other reasons 
the fda inspects and reviews clinical trial sites  informed consent forms  data from the clinical trial sites including case report forms and record keeping procedures and the performance of the protocols by clinical trial personnel to determine compliance with good clinical practices 
the fda also examines whether there was bias in the conduct of clinical trials 
the conduct of clinical trials is complex and difficult  especially in pivotal phase ii or phase iii trials 
there can be no assura nce that the design or the performance of the pivotal clinical trial protocols or any of our current or future product candidates will be successful 
the results of pre clinical studies and clinical trials  if successful  are submitted in an application for fda approval to market the drug or biological product for a specified use 
the testing and approval process requires substantial time and effort  and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted for any product at any time  according to any schedule  or at all 
the fda may refuse to accept or approve an application if it believes that applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied 
the fda may also require additional testing for safety and efficacy 
moreover  if regulatory approval is granted  the approval will be limited to specific indications 
there can be no assurance that any of our current product candidates will receive regulatory approvals for marketing or  if approved  that approval will be for any or al l of the indications that we request 
the fda is authorized to require various user fees  including nda fees currently up to million 
the fda may waive or reduce such user fees under certain circumstances  such as orphan drug designation for a product candidate 
we will seek waivers or reductions of user fees where possible  but we cannot be assured that we will be eligible for any such waiver or reduction 
post approval requirements after receipt of necessary regulatory approvals for initial manufacturing and sale of our product candidates  our contract manufacturing facilities and products are subject to ongoing review and periodic inspection 
each us drug manufacturing establishment must be registered with the fda 
manufacturing establishments in the us and abroad are subject to inspections by the fda and must comply with current good manufacturing practices 
in order to ensure full technical compliance with such practices  manufacturers must expend funds  time and effort in the areas of production and quality control 
in addition  the fda may impose post approval requirements on us  including the requirement that we conduct specified post marketing studies 
inspections we are subject to the periodic inspection of our clinical trials  facilities  procedures and operations and or the testing of our products by the fda to determine whether our systems and processes are in compliance with fda regulations 
following such inspections  the fda may issue notices on form and warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection 
a form notice is generally issued at the conclusion of an fda inspection and lists conditions the fda inspectors believe may violate fda regulations 
fda guidelines specify that a warning letter only is to be issued for violations of regulatory significance for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action 
recalls the fda has the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in manufacture 
a governmentally mandated recall  or a voluntary recall by us  could result from a number of events or factors  including component failures  manufacturing errors  instability of product or defects in labeling 
other fda regulations we are also subject to recordkeeping and reporting regulations 
these regulations require  among other things  the reporting to the fda of adverse events alleged to have been associated with the use of a product or in connection with certain product failures 
labeling and promotional activities are also regulated by the fda 
we must also comply with record keeping requirements as well as requirements to report certain adverse events involving our products 
the fda can impose other post marketing controls on us as well as our products including  but not limited to  restrictions on sale and use  through the approval process  regulations and otherwise 
product liability and insurance our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic products 
we presently have product liability insurance limited to million per incident  and if we were to be subject to a claim in excess of this coverage or to a claim not covered by our insurance and the claim succeeded  we would be required to pay the claim out of our own limited resources 
competition competition in the discovery and development of new methods for treating and preventing disease is intense 
we face  and will continue to face  intense competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies both in the us and abroad 
we face significant competition from organizations pursuing the same or similar technologies used by us in our drug discovery efforts and from organizations developing pharmaceuticals that are competitive with our product candidates 
most of our competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative partners  have substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development staffs than we do 
in addition  most of these organizations  either alone or together with their collaborators  have significantly greater experience than we do in developing products  undertaking preclinical testing and clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of products  and manufacturing and marketing products 
mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among our competitors 
these companies  as well as academic institutions  governmental agencies  and private research organizations  also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consulta nts 
our ability to compete successfully with other companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology field also depends on the status of our collaborations and on the continuing availability of capital to us 
thermodox although there are many drugs and devices marketed and under development for the treatment of cancer  the company is not aware of any other heat activated drug delivery product either being marketed or in human clinical development 
licenses  patents  trademarks and regulatory exclusivity with regard to liposome patents licensed from duke university  the company has filed two additional patents related to the formulation and use of liposomes 
further  in relation to the patents licensed from duke  the company has licensed from valentis  ca certain global rights covering the use of pegylation for temperature sensitive liposomes 
in  the company entered into a license agreement with duke university under which the company received exclusive rights subject to certain exceptions to commercialize and use duke s thermo liposome technology 
in  celsion s obligations under the license agreement with respect to the testing and regulatory milestones and other licensed technology performance deadlines were eliminated in exchange for a payment from celsion in shares of its common stock 
the license agreement continues to be subject to agreements to pay a royalty based upon future sales 
in conjunction with the patent holder  the company intends to file international applications for certain of the united states patents 
the company s rights under the license agreement with duke university extend for the longer of years or the end of any term for which any relevant patents are issued by the united states patent and trademark office 
currently  the company has rights to duke s patent for its thermo liposome technology in the united states  which expires in  and to future patents received by duke in canada  europe  japan and australia  where it has patent applications pending 
the european application can result in coverage in the european community 
for this technology  the company s license rights are worldwide  including the united states  canada  the european community  australia  hong kong  and japan 
in  the fda granted orphan drug designation for thermodox 
orphan drug designation entitles the company to seven years of market exclusivity following fda approval  fda assistance in clinical trial design  a reduction in fda user fees  us tax credits related to development expenses as well as the opportunity to apply for funding from the us government to defray the costs of clinical trial expenses 
in  the european commission granted orphan drug designation for thermodox for the treatment of hcc in europe 
as established by the european medicine agency ema  orphan drug designation provides for scientific advice and regulatory assistance from the ema  direct access to centralized marketing authorization and certain financial incentives  such as reduction of fees associated with pre authorization inspections and marketing authorization application fees 
the orphan drug designation in europe also provides years of market exclusivity subsequent to product approval 
in addition to the rights available to the company under completed or pending license agreements  the company relies on its own proprietary know how and experience in the development and use of heat for medical therapies  which the company seeks to protect  in part  through proprietary information agreements with employees  consultants and others 
the company cannot offer assurances that these information agreements will not be breached  that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that these agreements  even if fully enforced  will be adequate to prevent third party use of the company s proprietary technology 
similarly  the company cannot guarantee that technology rights licensed to it by others will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by third parties  or that the rights granted will provide the c ompany with adequate protection

recent events clinical trials on december   the company entered into a development  product supply and commercialization agreement for thermodox with yakult honsha co 
the yakult agreement pursuant to which the company granted to yakult an exclusive license  solely in the japanese market  to make  sell  import and use thermodox for the indications set forth in the yakult agreement in consideration of certain milestone and royalty payments  including an million milestone payment upon approval of thermodox by the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare for the treatment of primary liver cancer the approval milestone 
on january   the company entered into an amendment to the yakult agreement the amendment that provides for i a payment by yakult to the company of million that the company received on january  in consideration of a partial reduction in the approval milestone  and ii if and when the dmc permits the resumption of patient enrollment in japan for pivotal phase iii clinical study for thermodox  a payment by yakult to the company of an additional million in consideration of an additional  partial reduction in the approval milestone 
assuming payment by yakult of the million contemplated by the amendment and the partial reductions in the approval milestone related thereto  the aggregate approval milestone that the company may receive in the future will have been reduced by approximately forty percent 
on february   after reviewing data from randomized patients enrolled in our pivotal phase iii heat study  the dmc for this trial unanimously recommended that the trial continue to enroll patients at all clinical sites except for those in japan with the goal of reaching the patients required to complete the study 
the dmc continues to review safety and efficacy data in accordance with the pmda in japan and the dmc s charter  however there can be no assurance that the dmc will permit resumption of patient enrollment in japan or at all nor can there be any assurance that the company will receive the second million payment from yakult pursuant to the amendment to the yakult agreement 
at this time  the company is unable to determine what  if any  effect the catastrophic events resulting from the march  earthquake and tsunami in japan will have on the conduct or timeframe of the phase iii heat trial or the dmc s review of safety and efficacy data 
liquidity and capital resources on june   we entered into a financing arrangement  sometimes referred to as a committed equity line financing facility the ceff  with small cap biotech value  ltd 
the purchaser that provides that  upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein  the purchaser is committed to purchase up to million worth of our common stock over the month term of the purchase agreement  up to a maximum of  shares  under certain specified conditions and limitations

item a 
risk factors the following is a summary of the risk factors that we believe are most relevant to our business 
these are factors that  individually or in the aggregate  we think could cause our actual results to differ significantly from anticipated or historical results 
you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors 
consequently  you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosure we make on related subjects in our reports on forms q and k filed with the sec 
risks relating to our business we have a history of significant losses from continuing operations and expect to continue such losses for the foreseeable future 
since celsion s inception  our expenses have substantially exceeded our revenues  resulting in continuing losses and an accumulated deficit of million at december  for the year ended december  we incurred a net loss of million 
because we presently have no product revenues and we are committed to continuing our product research  development and commercialization programs  we will continue to experience significant operating losses unless and until we complete the development of thermodox and other new products and these products have been clinically tested  approved by the fda and successfully marketed 
if our products fail in clinical trials  we will be unable to obtain or maintain fda and international regulatory approvals and will be unable to sell those products 
to obtain regulatory approvals from the fda and international regulatory agencies  we must conduct clinical trials demonstrating that our products are safe and effective 
we may need to amend ongoing trials or the fda and or international regulatory agencies may require us to perform additional trials beyond those we planned 
such occurrences could result in significant delays and additional costs  and related clinical trials may be unsuccessful 
we do not expect to generate significant revenue for the foreseeable future 
we have devoted our resources to developing a new generation of products but will not be able to market these products until we have completed clinical testing and obtain all necessary governmental approvals 
in addition  our products are still in various stages of development and testing and cannot be marketed until we have completed clinical testing and obtained necessary governmental approval 
accordingly  our revenue sources are  and will remain  extremely limited until our products are clinically tested  approved by the fda and successfully marketed 
we cannot guarantee that any or all of our products will be successfully tested  approved by the fda or marketed  successfully or otherwise  at any time in the foreseeable future or at all 
if we do not raise additional capital  we may not be able to complete the development  testing and commercialization of our product candidates 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and short term investments 
to complete the development and commercialization of our product  we will need to raise substantial amounts of additional capital 
we do not have any committed sources of financing and cannot offer any assurances that alternate funding will be available in a timely manner  on acceptable terms or at all 
in the event we can not raise additional capital  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate certain aspects of our operations or attempt to obtain funds through unfavorable arrangements with partners or others that may force us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or potential markets or that could impose onerous financial or other terms 
furthermore  if we cannot fund our ongoing development and other operating requirements  particularly those associated with our obligations to conduct clinical trials under our licensing agreements  we will be in breach of these licensing agreements and could therefore lose our license rights  which could have material adverse effects on our business 
we have no internal sales or marketing capability and must enter into alliances with others possessing such capabilities to commercialize our products successfully 
we intend to market our products  if and when such products are approved for commercialization by the fda  either directly or through other strategic alliances and distribution arrangements with third parties 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into third party marketing or distribution arrangements on advantageous terms or at all 
to the extent that we do enter into such arrangements  we will be dependent on our marketing and distribution partners 
in entering into third party marketing or distribution arrangements  we expect to incur significant additional expense 
there can be no assurance that  to the extent that we sell products directly or we enter into any commercialization arrangements with third parties  such third parties will establish adequate sales and distribution capabilities or be successful in gain ing market acceptance for our products and services 
our business depends on license agreements with third parties to permit us to use patented technologies 
the loss of any of our rights under these agreements could impair our ability to develop and market our products 
our success will depend  in substantial part  on our ability to maintain our rights under license agreements granting us rights to use patented technologies 
we have entered into license agreements with duke university  under which we have exclusive rights to commercialize medical treatment products and procedures based on duke s thermo sensitive liposome technology 
the duke university license agreement contains a license fee  royalty and or research support provisions  testing and regulatory milestones  and other performance requirements that we must meet by certain deadlines 
if we were to breach these or other provisions of the license and research agreements  we could lose our ability to use the subject technology  as well as compensation for our efforts in developing or exploiting the technology 
any such loss of rights and access to technology could have a material adverse effect on our business 
further  we cannot guarantee that any patent or other technology rights licensed to us by others will not be challenged or circumvented successfully by third parties  or that the rights granted will provide adequate protection 
we are aware of published patent applications and issued patents belonging to others  and it is not clear whether any of these patents or applications  or other patent applications of which we may not have any knowledge  will require us to alter any of our potential products or processes  pay licensing fees to others or cease certain activities 
litigation  which could result in substantial costs  may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued to or licensed by us or to determine the scope and validity of others claimed proprietary rights 
we also rely on trade secrets and confidential information th at we seek to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners  collaborators  employees and consultants 
we cannot guarantee that these agreements will not be breached  that  even if not breached  that they are adequate to protect our trade secrets  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to  or will not be discovered independently by  competitors 
our products could infringe patent rights of others  which may require costly litigation and  if we are not successful  could cause us to pay substantial damages or limit our ability to commercialize our products 
our commercial success depends on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties 
there may be third party patents that relate to our products and technology 
we may unintentionally infringe upon valid patent rights of third parties 
although we are currently not involved in any material litigation involving patents  a third party patent holder could assert a claim of patent infringement against us in the future 
alternatively  we may initiate litigation against the third party patent holder to request that a court declare that we are not infringing the third party s patent and or that the third party s patent is invalid or unenforceable 
if a claim of infringement is asserted against us and is successful  and therefore we are found to infringe  we c ould be required to pay damages for infringement  including treble damages if it is determined that we knew or became aware of such a patent and we failed to exercise due care in determining whether or not we infringed the patent 
if we have supplied infringing products to third parties or have licensed third parties to manufacture  use or market infringing products  we may be obligated to indemnify these third parties for damages they may be required to pay to the patent holder and for any losses they may sustain 
we can also be prevented from selling or commercializing any of our products that use the infringing technology in the future  unless we obtain a license from such third party 
a license may not be available from such third party on commercially reasonable terms  or may not be available at all 
any modification to include a non infringing technology may not be possible or if possible may be difficult or time consuming to develop  and require revalidation  which could delay our ability to commercia lize our products 
any infringement action asserted against us  even if we are ultimately successful in defending against such action  would likely delay the regulatory approval process of our products  harm our competitive position  be expensive and require the time and attention of our key management and technical personnel 
we rely on third parties to conduct all of our clinical trials 
if these third parties are unable to carry out their contractual duties in a manner that is consistent with our expectations  comply with budgets and other financial obligations or meet expected deadlines  we may not receive certain development milestone payments or be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates in a timely or cost effective manner 
we currently have only full time employees 
we rely  and expect to continue to rely  on third party clinical research organizations to conduct our clinical trials 
because we do not conduct our own clinical trials  we must rely on the efforts of others and cannot always control or predict accurately the timing of such trials  the costs associated with such trials or the procedures that are followed for such trials 
we do not anticipate significantly increasing our personnel in the foreseeable future and therefore  expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct all of our future clinical trials 
if these third parties are unable to carry out their contractual duties or obligations in a manner that is consistent with our expectations or meet expected deadlines  if they d o not carry out the trials in accordance with budgeted amounts  if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons  or if they fail to maintain compliance with applicable government regulations and standards  our clinical trials may be extended  delayed or terminated or may become prohibitively expensive  we may not receive development milestone payments when expected or at all  and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates 
at this time  the company is unable to determine what  if any  effect the catastrophic events resulting from the march  earthquake and tsunami in japan will have on the conduct or timeframe of clinical trials for our phase iii heat study at sites in japan 
in addition  enrollment of additional patients at clinical sites in japan for our phase iii heat study is currently on hold pending the dmc  s ongoing review of safety and efficacy data in accordance with the pmda in japan and the dmc s charter 
a failure to resume patient enrollment at clinical trial sites in japan could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition as the resumption of patient enrollment is a condition to our receipt of an accelerated million development milestone payment under our agreement with yakult and is a mandatory conversion event of our redeemable convertible preferred stock 
our business is subject to numerous and evolving state  federal and foreign regulations and we may not be able to secure the government approvals needed to develop and market our products 
our research and development activities  pre clinical tests and clinical trials  and ultimately the manufacturing  marketing and labeling of our products  are all subject to extensive regulation by the fda and foreign regulatory agencies 
pre clinical testing and clinical trial requirements and the regulatory approval process typically take years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
additional government regulation may be established that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates 
delays or rejections in obtaining regulatory approvals would adversely affect our ability to commercialize any product candidates and our ability to generate product revenues or royalties 
the fda and foreign regulatory agencies require that the safety and efficacy of product candidates be supported through adequate and well controlled clinical trials 
if the results of pivotal clinical trials do not establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to the satisfaction of the fda and other foreign regulatory agencies  we will not receive the approvals necessary to market such product candidates 
even if regulatory approval of a product candidate is granted  the approval may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed 
we are subject to the periodic inspection of our clinical trials  facilities  procedures and operations and or the testing of our products by the fda to determine whether our systems and processes are in compliance with fda regulations 
following such inspections  the fda may issue notices on form and warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection 
a form notice is generally issued at the conclusion of an fda inspection and lists conditions the fda inspectors believe may violate fda regulations 
fda guidelines specify that a warning letter is issued only for violations of regulatory significance for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action 
failure to comply with fda and other governmental regulations can result in fines  unanticipated compliance expenditures  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production and or distribution  suspension of the fda s review of product applications  enforcement actions  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
under certain circumstances  the fda also has the authority to revoke previously granted product approvals 
although we have internal compliance programs  if these programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if our compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way  it could have a material adverse effect on the company 
we are also subject to recordkeeping and reporting regulations 
these regulations require  among other things  the reporting to the fda of adverse events alleged to have been associated with the use of a product or in connection with certain product failures 
labeling and promotional activities also are regulated by the fda 
we must also comply with record keeping requirements as well as requirements to report certain adverse events involving our products 
the fda can impose other post marketing controls on us as well as our products including  but not limited to  restrictions on sale and use  through the approval process  regulations and otherwise 
many states in which we do  or in the future  may do business  or in which our products may be sold  impose licensing  labeling or certification requirements that are in addition to those imposed by the fda 
there can be no assurance that one or more states will not impose regulations or requirements that have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products 
in many of the foreign countries in which we may do business or in which our products may be sold  we will be subject to regulation by national governments and supranational agencies as well as by local agencies affecting  among other things  product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  import restrictions  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
there can be no assurance that one or more countries or agencies will not impose regulations or requirements that could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products 
legislative and regulatory changes affecting the health care industry could adversely affect our business 
political  economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations 
there have been a number of government and private sector initiatives during the last few years to limit the growth of healthcare costs  including price regulation  competitive pricing  coverage and payment policies  comparative effectiveness of therapies  technology assessments and managed care arrangements 
it is uncertain which legislative proposals  if any  will be adopted or when or what actions federal  state  or private payors for health care treatment and services may take in response to any health care reform proposals or legislation 
we cannot predict the effect health care reforms may have on our business and we can offer no assurances th at any of these reforms will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
these actual and potential changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost effective treatments 
in addition  uncertainty remains regarding proposed significant reforms to the us healthcare system 
the success of our products may be harmed if the government  private health insurers and other third party payors do not provide sufficient coverage or reimbursement 
our ability to commercialize our new cancer treatment systems successfully will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other third party payors 
the reimbursement status of newly approved medical products is subject to significant uncertainty 
we cannot guarantee that adequate third party insurance coverage will be available for us to establish and maintain price levels sufficient for us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in developing new therapies 
government  private health insurers and other third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products appr oved for marketing by the fda 
accordingly  even if coverage and reimbursement are provided by government  private health insurers and third party payors for uses of our products  market acceptance of these products would be adversely affected if the reimbursement available proves to be unprofitable for health care providers 
our products may not achieve sufficient acceptance by the medical community to sustain our business 
our cancer treatment development projects using thermodox plus rfa or microwave heating  are currently in clinical trials 
any or all of these projects may prove not to be effective in practice 
if testing and clinical practice do not confirm the safety and efficacy of our product candidates or  even if further testing and practice produce positive results but the medical community does not view these new forms of treatment as effective and desirable  our efforts to market our new products may fail  with material adverse consequences to our business 
technologies for the treatment of cancer are subject to rapid change  and the development of treatment strategies that are more effective than our technologies could render our technologies obsolete 
various methods for treating cancer currently are  and in the future are expected to be  the subject of extensive research and development 
many possible treatments that are being researched  if successfully developed  may not require  or may supplant  the use of our technologies 
the successful development and acceptance of any one or more of these alternative forms of treatment could render our technology obsolete as a cancer treatment method 
we may not be able to hire or retain key officers or employees that we need to implement our business strategy and develop our products and business 
our success depends significantly on the continued contributions of our executive officers  scientific and technical personnel and consultants  and on our ability to attract additional personnel as we seek to implement our business strategy and develop our products and businesses 
during our operating history  we have assigned many essential responsibilities to a relatively small number of individuals 
however  as our business and the demands on our key employees expand  we have been  and will continue to be  required to recruit additional qualified employees 
the competition for such qualified personnel is intense  and the loss of services of certain key personnel or our inability to attract additional personnel to fill critical positions could adversely affect our business 
further  we do not carry key man insurance on any of our personnel 
therefore  loss of the services of key personnel would not be ameliorated by the receipt of the proceeds from such insurance 
our success will depend in part on our ability to grow and diversify  which in turn will require that we manage and control our growth effectively 
our business strategy contemplates growth and diversification 
our ability to manage growth effectively will require that we continue to expend funds to improve our operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures 
in addition  we must effectively expand  train and manage our employees 
we will be unable to manage our business effectively if we are unable to alleviate the strain on resources caused by growth in a timely and successful manner 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our growth and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we face intense competition and the failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products 
there are many companies and other institutions engaged in research and development of various technologies for cancer treatment products that seek treatment outcomes similar to those that we are pursuing 
we believe that the level of interest by others in investigating the potential of possible competitive treatments and alternative technologies will continue and may increase 
potential competitors engaged in all areas of cancer treatment research in the united states and other countries include  among others  major pharmaceutical  specialized technology companies  and universities and other research institutions 
most of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  human and other resources  and may also have far greater experience than do we  both in pre clinical testing and human clinical trials of new products and in obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals 
one or more of these companies or institutions could succeed in developing products or other technologies that are more effective than the products and technologies that we have been or are developing  or which would render our technology and products obsolete and non competitive 
furthermore  i f we are permitted to commence commercial sales of any of our products  we will also be competing  with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing  with companies having substantially greater resources and experience in these areas 
we may be subject to significant product liability claims and litigation 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic products 
we presently have product liability insurance limited to million per incident and million annually 
if we were to be subject to a claim in excess of this coverage or to a claim not covered by our insurance and the claim succeeded  we would be required to pay the claim with our own limited resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  liability or alleged liability could harm the business by diverting the attention and resources of our management and by damaging our reputation 
risks related to our common stock the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be volatile and fluctuate significantly  which could result in substantially losses for investors and subject us to securities class action litigation 
market prices for our common stock and the securities of other medical  high technology companies have been volatile 
our common stock had a high price of and a low price of in the week period ending december  among the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate are the risks described in this risk factors section and other factors  including fluctuations in our quarterly operating results or the operating results of our competitors  variance in our financial performance from the expectations of investors  changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets  changes in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles  which could affect our financial results  failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success  conditions and trends in the markets we serve  changes in general economic  industry and market conditions  success of competitive products and services  changes in market valuations or earnings of our competitors  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  announcements of significant new products  contracts  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors  changes in legislation or regulatory policies  practices  or actions  the commencement or outcome of litigation involving our company  our general industry or both  recruitment or departure of key personnel  changes in our capital structure  such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt  actual or expected sales of our common stock by our stockholders  and the trading volume of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market in general  the nasdaq capital market and the market for pharmaceutical companies in particular  may experience a loss of investor confidence 
such loss of investor confidence may result in extreme price and volume fluctuations in our common stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of our business  financial condition or results of operations 
these broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock and expose us to securities class action litigation 
such litigation  even if unsuccessful  could be costly to defend and divert management s attention and resources  which could further materially harm our financial condition and results of operations 
the adverse capital and credit market conditions could affect our liquidity 
adverse capital and credit market conditions could affect our ability to meet liquidity needs  as well as our access to capital and cost of capital 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for more than months 
in recent months  the volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels and the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers 
for example  recently credit spreads have widened considerably 
our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows and capital position could be materially adversely affected by continued disruptions in the capital and credit markets 
our stock historically has been thinly traded 
therefore  stockholders may not be able to sell their shares freely 
while our common stock is listed on the nasdaq capital market  the volume of trading historically has been relatively light 
there can be no assurance that our historically light trading volume  or any trading volume whatsoever  will be sustained in the future 
therefore  there can be no assurance that our stockholders will be able to sell their shares of our common stock at the time or at the price that they desire  or at all 
we have not paid dividends on our common stock in the past and do not intend to do so for the foreseeable future 
we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
as a result  the return on an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon the future appreciation in the price of our common stock 
our stockholders cannot achieve any degree of liquidity with respect to their shares of common stock except by selling such shares 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable by authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock 
this preferred stock may be issued by the board of directors the board  on such terms as it determines  without further stockholder approval 
therefore  the board may issue such preferred stock on terms unfavorable to a potential bidder in the event that the board opposes a merger or acquisition 
in addition  our classified board may discourage such transactions by increasing the amount of time necessary to obtain majority representation on the board 
we also have implemented a stockholder rights plan and distributed to our stockholders one right per share of our common stock 
when these rights become exerc isable  each right entitles their holders to purchase one ten thousandth  of a share of our series c junior participating preferred stock the preferred stock at a price of per one ten thousandth  share 
if any person or group acquires more than of our common stock  the holders of rights other than the person or group crossing the threshold will be able to receive  upon the exercise of their rights and in lieu of the preferred stock  the number of shares of our common stock or the number of shares of stock of any company into which we are merged having a value equal to twice the exercise price of their rights in exchange for the exercise price 
because these rights may substantially dilute stock ownership by a person or group seeking to take us over without the approval of our board  our rights plan could make it more difficult for a person or group to take us over or acquire significant ownership interest in us without negotiating with our board regarding such a transaction 
certain other provisions of our bylaws and of delaware law may also discourage  delay or prevent a third party from acquiring or merging with us  even if such action were beneficial to some  or even a majority  of our stockholders
