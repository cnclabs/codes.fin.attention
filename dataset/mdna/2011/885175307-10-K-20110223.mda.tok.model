the following presentation of management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview continuing operations cardiovascular business thoratec corporation we  our  us  or the company is the world leader in mechanical circulatory support with a product portfolio to treat the full range of clinical needs for advanced heart failure patients 
we develop  manufacture and market proprietary medical devices used for circulatory support 
for advanced heart failure hf  we develop  manufacture and market proprietary medical devices used for mechanical circulatory support mcs 
our primary product lines are our ventricular assist devices vads the thoratec paracorporeal ventricular assist device pvad  the thoratec implantable ventricular assist device ivad  the heartmate left ventricular assist system heartmate xve  and the heartmate ii left ventricular assist system heartmate ii 
we refer to the pvad and the ivad collectively as the thoratec product line and we refer to the heartmate xve and the heartmate ii collectively as the heartmate product line 
the pvad  ivad  heartmate xve and heartmate ii are approved by the us food and drug administration fda and are conformite europeene ce mark approved in europe 
in addition  for acute hf we market the centrimag blood pumping system centrimag  which is manufactured by levitronix llc levitronix and distributed by us in the us under a distribution agreement with levitronix 
we also manufacture a vascular access graft for renal dialysis 
vads supplement the pumping function of the heart in patients with advanced hf 
in most cases  a cannula connects the left ventricle of the heart to a blood pump 
blood flows from the left ventricle to the pump chamber via the cannula  powered by an electric or air driven mechanism that drives the blood through another cannula into the aorta 
from the aorta  the blood then circulates throughout the 
table of contents body 
mechanical or tissue valves enable unidirectional flow in some devices 
currently  the power source remains outside the body for all fda approved vads 
certain vads are implanted internally  while others are placed outside the body 
some external devices are placed immediately adjacent to the body paracorporeal  while other external vads are positioned at a distance from the body extracorporeal 
in addition to our mcs devices  we sell vascular access graft products used in hemodialysis for patients with late stage renal disease 
our product portfolio of implantable and external mcs devices and graft products is described below 
the heartmate ii the heartmate ii is an implantable  electrically powered  continuous flow  left ventricular assist device consisting of a miniature rotary blood pump designed to provide intermediate and long term mcs 
the heartmate ii is designed to improve survival and quality of life and to provide five to ten years of circulatory support for a broad range of advanced hf patients 
significantly smaller than the heartmate xve and with only one moving part  the heartmate ii is simpler and designed to operate more quietly than pulsatile devices 
effective january   the heartmate ii can be used in patients with new york heart association class iiib and iv end stage left ventricular failure who have received optimal medical therapy for at least forty five of the last ninety days  and who are not candidates for cardiac transplantation 
heartmate ii received fda approval in april for bridge to transplantation btt and received fda approval for use in hf patients who are not eligible for heart transplantation destination therapy or dt in january in november  the heartmate ii received ce mark approval  allowing for its commercial sale in europe 
in may  the heartmate ii was approved in canada 
during the third quarter of we launched our new heartmate external peripherals go gear  including new batteries  charger and power module  which are designed to provide an enhanced quality of life for heartmate patients by providing them more freedom and mobility and the ability to more easily resume many aspects of a normal lifestyle 
the heartmate xve the heartmate xve is an implantable  pulsatile  left ventricular assist device for intermediate and longer term mcs 
patients with a heartmate xve do not require anticoagulation drugs  other than aspirin  because of the product incorporation of proprietary textured surfaces and tissue valves 
the system is comprised of the implantable blood pump as well as the external peripherals  including a wearable controller and batteries  which provide a high degree of patient freedom and mobility 
we have communicated to our customers that we will be discontinuing the sale of the heartmate xve at the end of fiscal the heartmate xve received fda approval for btt in december and for destination therapy in april in june  the heartmate xve received ce mark approval  allowing for its commercial sale in europe 
in june  the heartmate xve was approved in canada 
the paracorporeal ventricular assist device the pvad is an external  pulsatile  ventricular assist device  fda approved for btt  including home discharge  and post cardiotomy myocardial recovery and provides left  right and biventricular mcs 
the pvad is a paracorporeal device that is less invasive than implantable vads since only the 
table of contents cannula is implanted 
the paracorporeal nature of the pvad has several benefits including shorter implantation times approximately two hours and the ability to use the device in smaller patients 
a pneumatic power source drives the pvad 
it is designed for short to intermediate duration use of a few weeks to several months  although this device has supported numerous patients for nine to eighteen months 
offering left  right or biventricular support  the pvad and the ivad  described below  are the only biventricular support systems approved for use as btt 
this characteristic is significant because approximately of btt patients treated with the pvad and the ivad require right as well as left sided ventricular assistance 
the pvad and the ivad are also the only devices approved for both btt and recovery following cardiac surgery 
the pvad incorporates our proprietary biomaterial  thoralon  which has excellent tissue and blood compatibility and is resistant to blood clots 
the pvad received fda approval for btt in december and for recovery post cardiotomy in may in june  the pvad received ce mark approval  allowing for its commercial sale in europe 
in november  the pvad was approved in canada 
the implantable ventricular assist device the ivad is an implantable  pulsatile  ventricular assist device fda approved for btt  including home discharge  and post cardiotomy myocardial recovery and provides left  right or biventricular mcs 
the ivad maintains the same blood flow path  valves and blood pumping mechanism as the pvad  but has an outer housing made of a titanium alloy that makes it suitable for implantation 
the ivad received fda approval for btt and recovery post cardiotomy in august in june  the ivad received ce mark approval  allowing for its commercial sale in europe 
in november  the ivad was approved in canada 
the centrimag the centrimag is manufactured by levitronix and is based on their magnetically levitated bearingless motor technology 
we entered into a distribution agreement with levitronix in august this agreement to distribute the centrimag in the us is effective through december the centrimag is k approved by the fda for use up to six hours in patients requiring short term extracorporeal circulatory support during cardiac surgery 
additionally  centrimag is approved under an fda humanitarian device exemption to be used as a right ventricular assist device for periods of support up to thirty days in patients in cardiogenic shock due to acute right ventricular failure 
in may  levitronix received approval to commence a us pivotal trial to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the centrimag for periods of support up to thirty days 
levitronix has ce mark approval in europe to market the product to provide support for up to thirty days 
vascular graft products the vectra vascular access graft vectra was approved for sale in the us in december and in europe in january it is designed for use as a shunt between an artery and a vein  primarily to provide access to the bloodstream for renal hemodialysis patients requiring frequent needle punctures during treatment 
discontinued operations international technidyne corporation itc on november   we sold our wholly owned subsidiary  international technidyne corporation  to itc nexus holding company  inc nexus for million in cash pursuant to a stock purchase agreement  dated as of november   by and between the company and nexus 
the itc division has been reclassified to discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact of  and any associated risks related to  these policies and estimates on our business operations are discussed below 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales to customers and distributors when evidence of an arrangement exists  and title has passed generally upon shipment or services have been rendered  the selling price including pricing discounts has been fixed or has become determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and there are no further obligations to customers or distributors  as applicable 
we recognize sales of certain products to first time customers when it has been determined that the customer has the ability to use the products 
these sales frequently include the sale of products and training services under multiple element arrangements 
training is not considered essential to the functionality of the products 
revenue under these arrangements is allocated to training based upon fair market value of the training  which is typically performed on our behalf by third party providers 
under this method  the total value of the arrangement is allocated to the training and the products based on the relative fair market value of the training and products 
in determining when to recognize revenue  management makes decisions on such matters as the fair value of the product and training elements when sold together  customer credit worthiness and warranty reserves 
if any of these decisions proves incorrect  the carrying value of these assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets or the recorded product sales could be significantly different  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for any fiscal period 
reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments owed to us for product sales and training services 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the majority of our products are covered by up to a one year limited manufacturer warranty from the date of shipment or installation 
estimated contractual warranty obligations are recorded when the related sales are recognized and any additional amounts are recorded when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated  at which time they are included in cost of product sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
in determining the warranty reserve estimate  management makes judgments and estimates on such matters as repair costs and probability of warranty obligations 
estimated excess and obsolete inventory charges are recorded when inventory levels exceed projected sales volume for a certain period of time 
in determining the excess obsolete charges  management makes judgments and estimates on matters such as forecasted sales volume 
if sales volume does not meet projections  additional write downs may be required 
management must make estimates and judgments to determine the amount of reserves to accrue 
if any of these decisions proves incorrect  our consolidated financial statements could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits and deductions  such as tax benefits from our non us operations and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would be charged to net income in the period such determination was made 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
in  we recorded a discrete benefit of approximately million to reflect the effect of a change in california tax law which will permit us to make beneficial apportionment elections beginning in fiscal year we are not aware of any other changes in tax laws or rates that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
financial accounting standard board fasb accounting standards codification asc  income taxes  provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on technical merits 
asc also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties and disclosure 
we believe we have provided adequate reserves for uncertain tax positions for anticipated audit adjustments by us federal  state and local  as well as foreign tax authorities based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes  interest and penalties may be due 
if events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the accrued liabilities are no longer warranted 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
purchased intangible assets and goodwill we record goodwill when the purchase price paid for a business that we have acquired exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in addition to intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination  we sometimes purchase patents and other intangible assets for cash or other consideration in individual transactions 
our purchased identifiable intangible assets include patents and trademarks  core technology and developed technology 
identifiable intangible assets with definitive useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis with estimated lives ranging from eight to twenty years 
in addition  our goodwill is not amortized 
our future operating results will be impacted by the future amortization of our purchased intangible assets and potential impairment charges related to these purchased intangible assets and goodwill  should we determine that impairment exists 
the allocation of the purchase price paid for a business acquisition to goodwill and other intangible assets involves significant estimates and assumptions by our management and  should future conditions differ significantly from these estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

table of contents purchased intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized over their estimated period of benefit  ranging from eight to twenty years 
we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically  and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or indicate that impairment exists  such as when the anticipated identifiable undiscounted cash flows expect to be generated from an intangible asset is less than the carrying value of the asset 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of intangible asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
no impairments of purchased intangible assets have been identified during the years presented 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests 
the impairment test for goodwill is a two step process 
step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit against its carrying amount 
after the sale of itc  we determined that our reporting unit is the cardiovascular division and its fair value is based on the present value of its estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  step two is performed to calculate the amount of impairment  which would be recorded as a charge in the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of a reporting unit is based upon a number of considerations including projections of revenues  earnings and discounted cash flows 
the discount rate used for cash flows reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business 
in addition  we compare the aggregate of our only reporting unit fair values to the company market capitalization as a further corroboration of the fair value 
the testing requires a complex series of assumptions and judgments by management in projecting future operating results and assessing risks 
the use of alternative assumptions and estimates could affect the fair values and change the impairment determinations 
based upon the assumptions as of our fiscal testing date  our reporting unit was not at risk of the carrying value exceeding the fair value 
valuation of share based awards share based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of option awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock  expected forfeitures and expected dividends 
when establishing the expected life assumption  we review annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting periods 
the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes option pricing model for option grants is based on a combination of our historical volatility and market based implied volatility 
prior to fiscal  our estimated volatility was based solely on the historical volatility of our common stock and beginning in fiscal we base our expected volatility on a combination of historical volatility trends and market based implied volatility because we have determined that this combination of historical volatility trends and market based implied trends are reflective of market conditions 
the decision to incorporate implied volatility was based on our assessment that implied volatility of publicly traded options in thoratec common stock is reflective of market conditions and is generally reflective of both historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility 
in determining the extent of using implied volatility  we considered i the volume of market activity of traded options  ii the ability to reasonably match the input variables of traded options to those of stock options granted by us  including the date of grant  iii the similarity of the exercise prices  and iv the length of term of traded options 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

table of contents fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in determining fair value  we use various approaches  including market  income and or cost approaches  and each of these approaches requires certain inputs 
fair value measurement standards establish a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of us 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions as compared to the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances 
the hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
assets and liabilities utilizing level inputs include broker dealer quoted securities that are traded in an active market 
since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market  a significant degree of judgment is not required 
level valuations based on quoted prices of similar investments in active markets  of similar or identical investments in markets that are not active or model based valuations for which all significant inputs and value drivers are observable  directly or indirectly 
assets and liabilities utilizing level inputs primarily include municipal bonds  variable demand notes  corporate bonds  commercial paper  foreign currency forward contracts  certain of our deferred compensation plan securities and our senior subordinated convertible notes 
level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
assets and liabilities utilizing level inputs include auction rate securities  and our purchased intangible asset valuations 
given the current credit market illiquidity for auction rate securities  our estimates are subject to significant judgment by management 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measure 
therefore  even when market assumptions are not readily available  our own assumptions are developed to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
see note  fair value measurements  to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our financial assets that are accounted for at fair value 
due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process  estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been obtained had an active market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
after determining the fair value of our available for sale securities  gains or losses on these investments are recorded to other comprehensive income  until either the investment is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other than temporary 
determining whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each investment 
for investments in available for sale securities  these judgments primarily consider our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity  whether it is more likely than not that we would be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment amortized cost basis and whether we expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the investment 
given the current market conditions  these judgments could prove to be incorrect  and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations 
in addition  if we decide not to hold an investment until its value recovers it may result in the recognition of an other than temporary impairment

continuing operations product sales product sales consisted of the following fiscal years annual percentage change in thousands product sales in as compared to  product sales increased by million primarily due to higher sales driven by increased worldwide heartmate ii volume  including go gear peripherals introduced in the third quarter of  and an increase in centrimag sales 
the increase in product sales were partially offset by a decline in sales of the heartmate xve and thoratec product lines as a result of cannibalization by the heartmate ii 
in north america  heartmate ii centers were added during bringing the total to centers 
outside of north america  we added centers in  bringing the total to centers 

table of contents in as compared to  product sales increased by million primarily due to higher sales driven by increased worldwide heartmate ii volume and the launch of go gear peripherals in the third quarter of  partially offset by the decline in stocking revenues as new heartmate ii centers were added in as compared to new heartmate ii centers in the increases in product sales were also partially offset by a decline in the sales of the heartmate xve and thoratec product lines as a result of cannibalization by the heartmate ii and unfavorable foreign exchange rates 
sales originating outside of the us and us export sales accounted for approximately  and of our total product sales in  and  respectively 
gross profit gross profit and gross margin were as follows fiscal years in thousands total gross profit total gross margin in as compared to  the gross margin percentage increased by primarily due to an increase in heartmate ii sales volume  the roll out of our external peripherals  and lower inventory write downs  partially offset by increased warranty reserves and unfavorable pump to non pump mix 
in as compared to  the gross margin percentage decreased by primarily due to an increase in inventory write downs  warranty reserves and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates  partially offset by increased heartmate ii volume and favorable manufacturing variances 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were as follows fiscal years annual percentage change in thousands total selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to  sales and marketing costs increased by million  primarily due to spending on product and market development initiatives  including sales force expansion 
administrative and other costs decreased by million primarily due to million in costs incurred in in connection with the terminated proposed acquisition of heartware international inc heartware offset by an increase in compensation costs and an increase in legal fees related to business development activity 
in as compared to  sales and marketing costs increased by million  primarily due to market development initiatives associated with the launch of go gear peripherals and the preparation for heartmate ii destination therapy approval and higher stock based compensation expense partially offset by lower bonus 
administrative and other costs increased by million  primarily due to million in costs related to the heartware transaction  partially offset by lower compensation costs 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses were as follows fiscal years annual percentage change in thousands total research and development expenses research and development costs are largely project driven  and fluctuate based on the level of project activity planned and subsequently approved and conducted 
in as compared to  research and development costs increased million primarily due to the write off of acquired php technology of million along with the development of the php pump  heartmate x  heartmate iii technologies and heartmate ii peripheral enhancements 
in as compared to  research and development costs increased million  primarily due to the heartmate product line peripheral enhancements and new product technology 
amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of purchased intangible assets was million in both and in  we acquired certain intangible assets  which we started amortizing 
this increase in amortization cost was offset by certain of our other intangible assets being fully amortized 
amortization of purchased intangible assets in was million as compared to million in the million decrease is attributable to certain intangible assets being fully amortized in the first quarter of interest expense interest expense primarily relates to interest on the senior subordinated convertible notes as follows fiscal years annual percentage change in thousands interest expense amortization of debt issuance costs related to senior subordinated convertible notes loss on extinguishment of senior subordinated convertible notes total interest expense interest expense  which is comprised primarily of the senior subordinated convertible notes  is calculated using the effective interest rate method which increases interest expense over the term of the debt 
however  during   bonds were converted of the  bonds originally issued  resulting in million less interest expense than in in addition  we recorded a loss on extinguishment of million from the  bonds converted 

table of contents interest income and other interest income and other consisted of the following fiscal years annual percentage change in thousands interest income foreign currency  net other total interest income and other in  interest income declined by million as compared to  primarily due to decline in market interest rates  partially offset by an increase in cash and investment balances 
foreign currency losses decreased by million in as compared to due to favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
other income increased by million in as compared to primarily due to higher royalty income earned and the change in the mark to market value of our deferred compensation plan assets during the year 
in  interest income declined by million as compared to  primarily due to decline in market interest rates and shortened maturities on our investment portfolio  partially offset by higher investment balances 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses decreased by million in as compared to due to certain foreign currency transactions related to inventory for our foreign operations  which were not hedged in our foreign currency contracts 
impairment on investment in we recorded an impairment charge of million for our entire investment in acorn cardiovascular  inc  a start up medical device company 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in compared to in this increase in the annual effective tax rate of was primarily due to an increase in pre tax income  fluctuations in return to provision adjustments including a benefit recognized in attributable to changes in state apportionment rates and an increase in the valuation allowance  offset by a reduction in non deductible compensation 
during the fourth quarter of  we realized a tax benefit related to the full year impact of the federal research and development tax credit  which was in part offset by a revaluation of the state apportionment rates due to the divestiture of itc 
our effective tax rate was in compared to in this increase in the annual effective tax rate of was primarily due to an increase in pre tax income  lower tax exempt interest and non deductible compensation  in part offset by a change in state apportionment rates 
discontinued operations on november   we sold our wholly owned subsidiary  international technidyne corporation itc  to itc nexus holding company  inc nexus for million in cash pursuant to a stock purchase agreement  dated as of november   by and between the company and nexus 
as such  we reclassified the assets and liabilities of itc as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets for the prior periods presented and the operating results as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 

table of contents discontinued operations incurred a loss of million during compared to a loss of million during the increase in the loss from discontinued operations was primarily due to increase in transaction costs and compensation costs related to the sale of itc  lower sales as a result of competitive activity and lower gross margin driven by unfavorable manufacturing variances 
in addition  we recorded a loss from the sale of itc of million 
discontinued operations incurred a loss of million during compared to income of million during the increase in the loss from discontinued operations was primarily due to lower product sales and lower gross margin driven by unfavorable manufacturing variances and unfavorable geographic and product mix 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and investments cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid financial instruments that are readily convertible to cash and have maturities of days or less from the date of purchase 
investments classified as short term consist of various financial instruments such as municipal bonds  corporate bonds and variable demand notes 
bonds with high credit quality with maturities of greater than days when purchased are classified as short term available for sale 
investments classified as long term consist of our investments in auction rate securities 
following is a summary of our cash  cash equivalents and investments january  january  january  in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term available for sale investments long term available for sale investments total cash and equivalents and available for sale investments we believe that cash and cash equivalents  short term available for sale investments on hand and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations  capital requirements and stock repurchase programs for at least the next twelve months 
as of january   we owned approximately million face amount of auction rate securities classified as long term 
the assets underlying these investments are student loans backed by the us government under the federal family education loan program or by private insurers and are rated between bbb and aaa 
historically  these securities have provided liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate periodically every seven to thirty five days 
beginning in february of  these auctions began to fail 
the principal amount of these auction rate securities will not be accessible until future auctions for these securities are successful  a secondary market is established  these securities are called for redemption  or they are paid at maturity 
we recorded an estimated cumulative unrealized loss of million million  net of tax related to the temporary impairment of the auction rate securities  which was included in accumulated other comprehensive gain loss within shareholders equity 
in addition  our management reviews impairments and credit loss associated with our investments  including auction rate securities to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary and to bifurcate the credit and non credit component of an other than temporary impairment event 
we do not intend to sell any of the auction rate securities prior to maturity at an amount below the original purchase value  intend to hold the investment to recovery and based on a more likely than not 
table of contents probability assessment we will not be required to sell the security before recovery  and deem that it is not probable that we will receive less than of the principal and accrued interest from the issuer 
therefore  of the impairment was charged to other comprehensive income 
further  we continue to liquidate investments in auction rate securities as opportunities arise 
during the fiscal year ended january   million in auction rate securities were redeemed at par and during the fiscal year ended january   million in auction rate securities were redeemed at par in connection with issuer calls 
we continue to monitor the market for auction rate securities and consider its impact if any on the fair value of our investments 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in fair values does not occur  we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income or other than temporary impairment charges to the consolidated statements of operations in future periods 
we intend and have the ability to hold these auction rate securities until the market recovers or until maturity 
we do not anticipate having to sell these securities in order to operate our business 
we believe that  based on our current unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable security investment balances of million as of january   the current lack of liquidity in the credit and capital markets will not have an impact on our liquidity  our cash flow or our ability to fund our operations 
if the issuers of the auction rate securities are unable to successfully complete future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
it could conceivably take until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize our investments recorded value 
in addition  as illustrated in the contractual obligations section  we have approximately million  including interest and penalties of unrecognized tax positions that have been recorded as liabilities and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
settlement of such amounts could require the utilization of working capital 
senior subordinated convertible notes in  we completed the sale of million initial principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes due in the senior subordinated convertible notes were issued at an issue price of per note  which is of the principal amount at maturity of the notes 
the senior subordinated convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per year on the principal amount at maturity  payable semi annually in arrears in cash on may and november of each year  from november  until may  holders of the senior subordinated convertible notes may convert their convertible notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes  which represents a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events as set forth in the indenture 
holders have been and are able to convert their convertible notes at any point after the close of business on september  if  as of the last day of the preceding calendar quarter  the closing price of our common stock for at least trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of such preceding calendar quarter is more than of the accreted conversion price per share of our common stock 
commencing october   this market price conversion feature was satisfied  such that holders of the senior subordinated convertible notes may convert their notes through the final maturity date of the notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes  subject to adjustments as provided in the indenture 
if holders elect conversion  we may  at our option  deliver shares of common stock  pay a holder in cash  or deliver a combination of shares and cash  as determined pursuant to the terms of the notes 
as of january    of the  bonds originally issued have been submitted to be converted and we elected to pay cash in lieu of shares for these bonds 

table of contents in addition  holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their senior subordinated convertible notes on each of may     and at a repurchase price equal to of the issue price  plus the accrued original issue discount  if any

recently issued accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition topic milestone method 
asu no 
provides guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate 
under the milestone method of revenue recognition  consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety can be recognized as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive 
asu no 
provides the criteria to be met for a milestone to be considered substantive which includes i performance consideration earned by achieving the milestone be commensurate with either performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from performance to achieve the milestone  and ii past performance be reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
asu no 
is effective on a prospective basis for us for milestones achieved on or after january  we do not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our investment portfolio is made up of marketable investments in money market funds  auction rate securities  us treasury securities and debt instruments of government agencies  local municipalities  and high quality corporate issuers 
all investments are carried at market value and are treated as available for sale 
investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature due to the frequency with which the interest rate is reset and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
our holdings of the securities of any one issuer  except government agencies  do not exceed of the portfolio 
our investment portfolio and cash equivalents that bear variable interest would have an immaterial impact to interest income  on the consolidated statements of operations  if interest rates would have fallen by basis points 
in addition  if interest rates rise  the market value of our investment portfolio may decline  which could result in a loss if we choose or are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
if interest rates were to rise or fall from current levels by basis points and by basis points  the change in our net unrealized loss on investments would be million and million  respectively 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risks 
our senior subordinated convertible notes do not bear interest rate risk as the notes were issued at a fixed rate of interest 
as of january  we owned approximately million of auction rate securities  which is part of our investment portfolio 
the assets underlying these auction rate securities are student loans which are rated between bbb and aaa  and backed by the us government under the federal family education loan program or private insurers 
historically  these securities have provided liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate  periodically every seven to thirty five days 
beginning in february of  these auctions began to fail 
although we have realized 
table of contents at or below market interest rates for many of these auction rate securities than we otherwise would have  the principal amount will not be accessible until future auctions for these securities are successful  a secondary market is established  or these securities are called for redemption 
therefore  our auction rate securities are classified as long term and are valued at million  net of a million impairment  using significant unobservable inputs 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity of these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
foreign currency rate fluctuations we use forward foreign currency contracts to mitigate the gains and losses generated by the re measurement of non functional currency assets and liabilities 
our contracts typically have maturities of four months or less 
effective january   we changed our functional currency for our uk subsidiary from uk pounds to euros 
this change did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
as of january   we had forward contracts to sell euros to us dollars with a notional value of million  to sell us dollars to euros with a notional value of million  and to sell uk pounds to euros with a notional value of million 
as of january   we had forward contracts to sell euros to us dollars with a notional value of million and to sell uk pounds to uk dollars with a notional value of million 
as of january   our forward contracts to sell had an average exchange rate of one us dollar to euros and one euro to uk pounds 
the potential fair value loss for a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates as of january  would be approximately million
