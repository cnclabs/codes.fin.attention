item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
glossary of terms in analyzing and discussing our business  we utilize certain metrics  ratios and other terms that are defined in the glossary of terms  which is located at the end of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview strategy our core business is our trading and investing customer franchise 
building on the strengths of this franchise  our growth strategy is focused on four areas retail brokerage  corporate services and market making  wealth management  and banking 
our retail brokerage business is our foundation 
we believe a focus on these key factors will position us for future growth in this business growing our sales force with a focus on long term investing  optimizing our marketing spend  continuing to develop innovative products and services and minimizing account attrition 
our corporate services and market making businesses enhance our strategy by allowing us to realize additional economic benefit from our retail brokerage business 
our corporate services business is a leading provider of software and services for managing equity compensation plans and is an important source of new retail brokerage accounts 
our market making business allows us to increase the economic benefit on the order flow from the retail brokerage business as well as generate additional revenues through external order flow 
we also plan to expand our wealth management offerings 
our vision is to provide wealth management services that are enabled by innovative technology and supported by guidance from professionals when needed 
our retail brokerage business generates a significant amount of customer cash and we plan to continue to utilize our bank to optimize the value of these customer deposits 
our strategy also includes an intense focus on mitigating the credit losses in our legacy loan portfolio and maintaining disciplined expense management 
we remain focused on strengthening our overall capital structure and positioning the company for future growth 
key factors affecting financial performance our financial performance is affected by a number of factors outside of our control  including customer demand for financial products and services  weakness or strength of the residential real estate and credit markets  performance  volume and volatility of the equity and capital markets  customer perception of the financial strength of our franchise  market demand and liquidity in the secondary market for mortgage loans and securities  market demand and liquidity in the wholesale borrowings market  including securities sold under agreements to repurchase  
table of contents our ability to obtain regulatory approval to move capital from our bank to our parent company  and changes to the rules and regulations governing the financial services industry 
in addition to the items noted above  our success in the future will depend upon  among other things continuing our success in the acquisition  growth and retention of trading customers  our ability to generate meaningful growth in the long term investing customer group  our ability to assess and manage credit risk  our ability to generate capital sufficient to meet our operating needs  particularly a level sufficient to offset loan losses  our ability to assess and manage interest rate risk  and disciplined expense control and improved operational efficiency 
management monitors a number of metrics in evaluating the company s performance 
the most significant of these are shown in the table and discussed in the text below as of or for the year ended december  variance vs 
customer activity metrics darts average commission per trade margin receivables dollars in billions end of period brokerage accounts net new brokerage accounts customer assets dollars in billions net new brokerage assets dollars in billions brokerage related cash dollars in billions company financial metrics corporate cash dollars in millions e trade bank excess risk based capital dollars in millions special mention loan delinquencies dollars in millions allowance for loan losses dollars in millions enterprise net interest spread enterprise interest earning assets average in billions percentage not meaningful 
the prior periods presented have been updated to exclude international local market trading 
customer activity metrics darts are the predominant driver of commissions revenue from our customers 
average commission per trade is an indicator of changes in our customer mix  product mix and or product pricing and is impacted by the mix between our customer groups 
margin receivables represent credit extended to customers and non customers to finance their purchases of securities by borrowing against securities they currently own 
margin receivables are a key driver of net operating interest income 
end of period brokerage accounts and net new brokerage accounts are indicators of our ability to attract and retain trading and investing customers 

table of contents changes in customer assets are an indicator of the value of our relationship with the customer 
an increase in customer assets generally indicates that the use of our products and services by existing and new customers is expanding 
changes in this metric are also driven by changes in the valuations of our customers underlying securities 
net new brokerage assets are total inflows to all new and existing brokerage accounts less total outflows from all closed and existing brokerage accounts and are a general indicator of the use of our products and services by existing and new brokerage customers 
customer cash and deposits  particularly brokerage related cash  are an indicator of a deepening engagement with our customers and are a key driver of net operating interest income 
company financial metrics corporate cash is an indicator of the liquidity at the parent company 
it is also a source of cash that can be deployed in our regulated subsidiaries 
e trade bank excess risk based capital is the excess capital that e trade bank has compared to the regulatory minimum to be considered well capitalized and is an indicator of e trade bank s ability to absorb future losses 
it is also a potential source of additional corporate cash as this capital  if requested by us and approved by our regulators  could be sent as a dividend or otherwise distributed up to the parent company 
special mention loan delinquencies are loans days past due and are an indicator of the expected trend for charge offs in future periods as these loans have a greater propensity to migrate into nonaccrual status and ultimately charge off 
allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is typically equal to the expected charge offs in our loan portfolio over the next twelve months as well as the estimated charge offs  including economic concessions to borrowers  over the estimated remaining life of loans modified in troubled debt restructurings 
the general allowance for loan losses also includes a specific qualitative component to account for a variety of economic and operational factors  including the uncertainty of how modified loans will perform over the long term  which we believe may impact our level of credit losses 
enterprise interest earning assets  in conjunction with our enterprise net interest spread  are indicators of our ability to generate net operating interest income 
significant events in enhancements to our trading and investing products and services we expanded our advice offering by introducing managed investment portfolio advisory services to long term investors with an investment of  or more  and unified managed account advisory services to long term investors with an investment of  or more  we expanded power e trade pro s customization capabilities  navigation tools  and news and information  including cnbc plus streaming video  we launched the e trade mobile pro application for apple ipad and android smartphones  expanding our suite of mobile applications  which already included blackberry and apple iphone  we created open api for third party and independent software developers  which allows customers to have access to technical information and documentation  reference guides  and other resources to help network external applications and programs with our active trader platform  and we introduced new research and trade idea generation tools that we believe help our customers identify investment opportunities and make informed decisions 
these new tools include market commentary from dreyfus and minyanville s buzz banter  a business and finance site 

table of contents simplified commission and fee structure in february  we announced several changes to the pricing structure in our brokerage business 
we eliminated the commission tier  account activity fees and a per share commission applied to market trades larger than  shares 
we believe these changes simplified our overall pricing structure 
market recognition our corporate services business rated highest in overall satisfaction and loyalty among broker plan administrators for full and partial outsourced stock plan administration by group five  an independent consulting and research firm  in their stock plan administration benchmarking study 
completed the sale of approximately billion in deposits we sold approximately billion of savings accounts to discover financial services in march this transaction is in line with our overall strategy of reducing our balance sheet and growing our brokerage business as the savings accounts sold were predominantly with customers not affiliated with an active brokerage account 
completion of for reverse stock split in june  we completed a for reverse stock split 
all prior periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the impact of this reverse stock split  including the impact on basic and diluted weighted average shares and shares issued and outstanding 
earnings overview compared to we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december   due primarily to provision for loan losses of million 
our provision for loan losses reported in our balance sheet management segment more than offset the strong performance of our trading and investing segment  which generated segment income of million for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses has declined for two consecutive years and we expect it to continue to decline in when compared to  although performance is subject to variability in any given quarter 
the following sections describe in detail the changes in key operating factors and other changes and events that have affected our net revenue  provision for loan losses  operating expense  other income expense and income tax expense benefit 

table of contents revenue the components of net revenue and the resulting variances are as follows dollars in millions variance year ended december  vs

total net revenue decreased to billion for the year ended december  compared to this was driven by lower commissions  fees and service charges and net operating interest income  which was slightly offset by a decrease in net impairment and an increase in principal transactions 
net operating interest income net operating interest income decreased to billion for the year ended december  compared to net operating interest income is earned primarily through investing customer cash and deposits in interest earning assets  which include margin receivables  real estate loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
the slight decrease in net operating interest income was due primarily to a decrease in our average interest earning assets of billion during the year ended december   which was offset by an increase in our net operating interest spread during the same period

average enterprise interest bearing liabilities decreased to billion for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to decreases in average complete savings deposits and average certificates of deposit offset by an increase in average sweep deposits 
enterprise net interest spread increased by basis points to for the year ended december  compared to this increase was largely driven by a decrease in the yields paid on our deposits and lower wholesale borrowing costs  partially offset by a decrease in higher yielding enterprise interest earning assets 
commissions commissions decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to the main factors that affect our commissions are darts  average commission per trade and the number of trading days during the period 
average commission per trade is impacted by different trade types eg equities  options  fixed income  stock plan  exchange traded funds  mutual funds and cross border that can have different commission rates 
accordingly  changes in the mix of trade types will impact average commission per trade 
our dart volume decreased to  for the year ended december  compared option related darts as a percentage of our total darts represented and of trading volume for the years ended december  and  respectively 
exchange traded funds related darts as a percentage of our total darts represented and of trading volume for the years ended december  and  respectively 
average commission per trade decreased to for the year ended december  compared to the slight decrease in the average commission per trade was due primarily to the elimination of the commission tier and the per share commission applied to market trades larger than  shares  which became effective in the second quarter of  partially offset by an improvement in the product and customer mix when compared to the same period in fees and service charges fees and service charges decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease was primarily due to the elimination of all account activity fees  which became effective in the second quarter of  and lower order flow revenue 

table of contents principal transactions principal transactions increased to million for the year ended december  compared to our principal transactions are derived from our market making business in which we act as a market maker for our brokerage customers orders as well as orders from third party customers 
the increase in principal transactions was driven by an increase in the volume of orders from our third party customers which was partially offset by a decrease in our average revenue earned per share traded when compared to the same period in gains on loans and securities  net gains on loans and securities  net were million and million for years ended december  and  respectively  as shown in the following table dollars in millions variance year ended december  vs

net impairment we recognized million and million of net impairment during the years ended december  and  respectively  on certain securities in our non agency cmo portfolio due to continued deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities 
the gross other than temporary impairment otti and the noncredit portion of otti  which was or had been previously recorded through other comprehensive income loss  are shown in the table below dollars in millions year ended december  other than temporary impairment otti less noncredit portion of otti recognized into other comprehensive income loss before tax net impairment other revenues other revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease was due to a decline in the income from the cash surrender value of our bank owned life insurance  partially offset by the gain on the sale of approximately billion in savings accounts to discover financial services in the first quarter of provision for loan losses provision for loan losses decreased to million for the year ended december  compared the decrease in our provision for loan losses was driven by lower levels of at risk days delinquent loans in our one to four family and home equity loan portfolios 
we believe the delinquencies in 
table of contents both of these portfolios were caused by several factors  including significant continued home price depreciation  weak demand for homes and high inventories of unsold homes  significant contraction in the availability of credit  and a general decline in economic growth along with higher levels of unemployment 
in addition  the combined impact of home price depreciation and the reduction of available credit made it difficult for borrowers to refinance existing loans 
the provision for loan losses has declined for two consecutive years and we expect it to continue to decline in when compared to  although performance is subject to variability in any given quarter 
operating expenses the components of operating expense and the resulting variances are as follows dollars in millions variance year ended december  vs 
amount compensation and benefits clearing and servicing advertising and market development professional services fdic insurance premiums communications occupancy and equipment depreciation and amortization amortization of other intangibles facility restructuring and other exit activities other operating expenses total operating expense operating expense decreased to billion for the year ended december  compared to the fluctuation was driven by decreases in the majority of operating expense categories  offset by a planned increase in advertising and market development 
compensation and benefits compensation and benefits decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to this decrease resulted from lower incentive compensation expense and lower salary expense due to a reduction in our employee base compared to the same period in clearing and servicing clearing and servicing expense decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to this decrease resulted primarily from lower trading volumes and lower loan balances compared to the same period in advertising and market development advertising and market development expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to this fluctuation was due largely to a planned increase in advertising expense to attract new accounts and customer assets during the year ended december  
table of contents fdic insurance premiums fdic insurance premiums decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease was due primarily to an industry wide special assessment that resulted in an additional million of expense in the second quarter of there were no similar assessments made during the year ended december  other operating expenses other operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease was driven primarily by a decline in bad debt expense  real estate owned and legal reserves compared to other income expense other income expense was an expense of million and billion for the years ended december  and  respectively  as shown in the following table dollars in millions variance year ended december  vs 
amount corporate interest income corporate interest expense gains losses on sales of investments  net losses on early extinguishment of debt equity in loss of investments and venture funds total other income expense percentage not meaningful 
total other income expense for the year ended december  primarily consisted of corporate interest expense resulting from our interest bearing corporate debt 
corporate interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to this was due to the reduction in interest bearing debt in connection with our debt exchange in the losses on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december  were related primarily to the debt exchange 
the loss on the debt exchange resulted from the de recognition of the debt that was exchanged and the corresponding recognition of the newly issued non interest bearing convertible debentures at fair value 
corporate interest income increased to million for the year ended december  when compared to due to a benefit of million in connection with a legal settlement 
income tax expense benefit income tax expense was million and a benefit of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our effective tax rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was higher than in for two reasons our pre tax loss included items not deductible for tax purposes  predominantly about one third of the interest expense on the springing lien notes  and our reported pre tax loss is relatively close to breakeven for the year ended december  as a result  our income subject to taxation is higher  resulting in an unusually high effective tax rate for the year ended december  we expect our effective tax rate to be volatile in periods where pre tax income or loss is relatively close to breakeven  but expect a more normalized rate as  and to the extent  we become profitable in future periods 

table of contents valuation allowance we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if we determine  based on available evidence at the time the determination is made  that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we did conclude that a valuation allowance was required  the resulting loss would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we did not establish a valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets as of december  as we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized 
our evaluation focused on identifying significant  objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future 
we reviewed the estimated future taxable income for our trading and investing and balance sheet management segments separately and determined that our net operating losses since are due solely to the credit losses in our balance sheet management segment 
we believe these losses were caused by the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets which significantly impacted our asset backed securities and home equity loan portfolios in and continued to generate credit losses in  and we estimate that these credit losses will continue in future periods  however  we ceased purchasing asset backed securities and home equity loans which we believe are the root cause of the majority of these losses 
therefore  while we do expect credit losses to continue in future periods  we do expect these amounts to decline when compared to our credit losses in the three year period ending in our trading and investing segment generated substantial taxable income for each of the last seven years and we estimate that it will continue to generate taxable income in future periods at a level sufficient to generate taxable income for the company as a whole 
we consider this to be significant  objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future 
a key component of our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance was our level of corporate interest expense  which represents our most significant non operating related expense 
our estimates of future taxable income included this expense  which reduces the amount of segment income available to utilize our federal deferred tax assets 
therefore  a decrease in this expense in future periods would increase the level of estimated taxable income available to utilize our federal deferred tax assets 
as a result of the debt exchange in  we reduced our annual cash interest payments by approximately million 
we believe this decline in cash interest payments significantly improves our ability to utilize our federal deferred tax assets in future periods when compared to evaluations in prior periods which did not include this decline in corporate interest payments 
our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that we are in a cumulative book taxable loss position as of the three year period ended december   which is considered significant and objective evidence that we may not be able to realize some portion of our deferred tax assets in the future 
however  in  we generated taxable income consistent with our forecast that resulted in the utilization of significant net operating loss carryforwards 
accordingly  we believe we are able to continue relying on our forecasts of future taxable income and overcome the uncertainty created by the cumulative loss position 
the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets has created significant volatility in our results of operations 
this volatility is isolated almost entirely to our balance sheet management segment 
our forecasts for this segment include assumptions regarding our estimate of future expected credit losses  which we believe to be the most variable component of our forecasts of future taxable income 
we believe this variability could create a book loss in our overall results for an individual reporting period while not significantly impacting our overall estimate of taxable income over the period in which we expect to realize our deferred tax assets 
conversely  we believe our trading and investing segment will continue to produce a stable stream of income which we believe we can reliably estimate in both individual reporting periods as well as over the period in which we estimate we will realize our deferred tax assets 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we estimated future taxable income based on management approved forecasts 
this process required significant judgment by management about matters that are by nature uncertain 
if future events differ significantly from our current forecasts  a valuation allowance may need to be established  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition 

table of contents we have maintained a valuation allowance for certain of our state deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
at december   we had a deferred tax asset of approximately million that related to our state net operating loss carryforwards with a valuation allowance of million against such deferred tax asset 
the change in our valuation allowance during was primarily due to reclassification of unrealized tax benefit offset by current year activity 
the majority of the reclassified unrecognized tax benefit relates to the application of section to state net operating losses 
tax ownership change during the third quarter of  we exchanged billion principal amount of our interest bearing debt for an equal principal amount of non interest bearing convertible debentures 
subsequent to the debt exchange  million and million debentures were converted into million and million shares of common stock during the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
as a result of these conversions  we believe we experienced a tax ownership change during the third quarter of as of the date of the ownership change  we had federal nols available to carryforward of approximately billion 
section imposes restrictions on the use of a corporation s nols  certain recognized built in losses and other carryovers after an ownership change occurs 
section rules governing when a change in ownership occurs are complex and subject to interpretation  however  an ownership change generally occurs when there has been a cumulative change in the stock ownership of a corporation by certain shareholders of more than percentage points over a rolling three year period 
section imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre ownership change nols 
in general  the annual limitation is determined by multiplying the value of the corporation s stock immediately before the ownership change subject to certain adjustments by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
any unused portion of the annual limitation is available for use in future years until such nols are scheduled to expire in general  our nols may be carried forward years 
in addition  the limitation may  under certain circumstances  be increased or decreased by built in gains or losses  respectively  which may be present with respect to assets held at the time of the ownership change that are recognized in the five year period one year for loans after the ownership change 
the use of nols arising after the date of an ownership change would not be affected unless a corporation experienced an additional ownership change in a future period 
we believe the tax ownership change will extend the period of time it will take to fully utilize our pre ownership change nols  but will not limit the total amount of pre ownership change nols we can utilize 
our updated estimate is that we will be subject to an overall annual limitation on the use of our pre ownership change nols of approximately million 
our overall pre ownership change nols  which were approximately billion  have a statutory carryforward period of years the majority of which expire in years 
as a result  we believe we will be able to fully utilize these nols in future periods 
our ability to utilize the pre ownership change nols is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income over the duration of the carryforward periods and will not be impacted by our ability or inability to generate taxable income in an individual year 
compared to we incurred a net loss of billion for the year ended december  due principally to the debt exchange that resulted in a non cash loss of million pre tax loss of million on early extinguishment of debt during the third quarter of our trading and investing segment income was million for the year ended december  however  the provision for loan losses in our balance sheet management segment more than offset this strong performance  resulting in a consolidated loss before income taxes of billion for the year ended december  
table of contents on april   we adopted the amended guidance for the recognition of otti for debt securities as well as the presentation of otti on the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the adoption  we recognized a million after tax decrease to beginning accumulated deficit and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet 
this adjustment represents the after tax difference between the impairment reported in prior periods for securities on our balance sheet as of april  and the level of impairment that would have been recorded on these same securities under the new accounting guidance 
additionally  in accordance with the new guidance  we changed the presentation of the consolidated statement of loss to state net impairment as a separate line item  as well as the credit and noncredit components of net impairment 
prior to this new presentation  otti was included in the gains losses on loans and securities  net line item on the consolidated statement of loss

our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that we were in a cumulative book taxable loss position as of the three year period ended december   which is considered significant and objective evidence that we may not be able to realize some portion of our deferred tax assets in the future 
however  we believed we were able to rely on our forecasts of future taxable income and overcome the uncertainty created by the cumulative loss position
