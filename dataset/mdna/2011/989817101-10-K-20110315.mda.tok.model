item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in item a risk factors 
see the cautionary note regarding forward looking statements set forth at the beginning of part i of the annual report on form k 
overview we are a mall based specialty retailer of action sports related apparel  footwear  equipment and accessories operating under the zumiez brand name 
at january   we operated stores primarily located in shopping malls  giving us a presence in states 
our stores cater to young men and women between the ages of and who seek popular brands representing a lifestyle centered on activities that include skateboarding  surfing  snowboarding  bmx and motocross 
we support the action sports lifestyle and promote our brand through a multi faceted marketing approach that is designed to integrate our brand image with our customers activities and interests 
this approach  combined with our differentiated merchandising strategy  store design  comprehensive training programs and passionate employees  allows us to provide an experience for our customers that we believe is consistent with their attitudes  fashion tastes and identities and is otherwise unavailable in most malls 
accordingly  our success is largely dependent upon our ability to anticipate  identify and respond to the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demands 
fiscal a review of this past year zumiez financial results in fiscal meaningfully exceeded our own projections and these results were significant  particularly when viewing against the teen retail landscape in what remained a tenuous consumer environment 
in addition  while accomplishing these results  we made strategic investments that we believe will reap long term benefits focused on enhancing the customer experience across multiple sales channels  and on our people and infrastructure aimed at improving decision making and product speed to market 
the table below show net sales  operating profit and margin and diluted earnings per share growth for fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal year ended january  january  change net sales in thousands operating profit in thousands operating margin diluted earnings per share our sales results were primarily driven by an increase in transactions  which is a testament to our differentiated product offering and the unique customer experience our store associates provide 
the strong sales results we realized in fiscal translated to a significant increase in operating income  operating margin and diluted earnings per share compared to fiscal due to our unique business model and focus on managing our cost structure 

table of contents fiscal a look at the upcoming year while the momentum we have seen throughout fiscal would suggest that discretionary spending is increasing  unemployment  debt and housing remain concerns and the economy is still in recovery 
in addition  other challenges have surfaced as we look out into fiscal  most notably increases in production costs that may have an impact on our ability to maintain product margins 
considering these factors  our current outlook is cautiously optimistic  and we are planning the business conservatively for fiscal for the year  we expect total sales to increase driven by an increase in comparable store sales  the opening of approximately new stores  including our first stores in canada  and increased sales from our ecommerce channel 
if we achieve our sales projections  we expect earnings will increase in fiscal we will make further investments in people and infrastructure in fiscal  building on the progress we have made through fiscal  primarily focused on the development of our multi channel sales strategies  expansion into canada and continued progress on our product assortment planning and supply chain solutions and a capital investment related to building a new home office  planned to opening in the spring of we expect our cash  short term investments and working capital to increase  and do not anticipate any borrowings on our credit facility 
inventory levels per square foot are expected to grow due to increased production costs and to support sales growth 
general net sales constitute gross sales net of actual and estimated returns and deductions for promotions 
net sales include our in store sales and our ecommerce sales  which includes ecommerce shipping revenue 
ecommerce sales were  and of total net sales for fiscal  and sales of gift cards are deferred and recognized when gift cards are redeemed 
the amount of the gift card liability is determined taking into account our estimate of the portion of gift cards that will not be redeemed or recovered gift card breakage 
gift card breakage is recognized as revenue after months  at which time the likelihood of redemption is considered remote based on our historical redemption data 
we report comparable store sales based on net sales beginning on the first anniversary of the first day of operation of a new store 
our comparable store sales also include our ecommerce sales 
changes in our comparable store sales between two periods are based on net sales of stores which were in operation during both of the two periods being compared and  if a store is included in the calculation of comparable store sales for only a portion of one of the two periods being compared  then that store is included in the calculation for only the comparable portion of the other period 
any change in square footage of an existing comparable store  including remodels  does not eliminate that store from inclusion in the calculation of comparable store sales 
there may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other apparel retailers calculate comparable or same store sales 
as a result  data herein regarding our comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors or other retailers 
cost of goods sold consists of branded merchandise costs and our private label merchandise costs including design  sourcing  importing and inbound freight costs 
our cost of goods sold also includes shrinkage and buying  occupancy  distribution and warehousing costs 
this may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of goods sold 
we receive cash consideration from vendors  which have been reported as a reduction cost of goods sold if the inventory has sold  as a reduction of the carrying value of the inventory if the inventory is still on hand  or a reduction of selling  general and administrative expense if the amounts are reimbursements of specific  incremental and identifiable costs of selling the vendors products 
with respect to the freight component of our ecommerce sales  we arrange and pay the freight for our customers and bill them for this service  unless our customers have their product shipped to one of our stores or we have free shipping promotions to our customers  in which case we do not bill our customers 
such amounts billed are included in net sales and the related freight cost is charged to cost of goods sold 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of store personnel wages and benefits  administrative staff and infrastructure expenses  outbound freight  store supplies  depreciation on fixed assets at our home office and stores  facility expenses and training  advertising and marketing costs 
credit card fees  insurance  public company expenses  legal expenses and other miscellaneous operating costs are also included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
this may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling  general and administrative expenses 
key performance indicators our management evaluates the following items  which we consider key performance indicators  in assessing our performance comparable store sales 
as previously described in detail under the caption general  comparable store sales provide a measure of sales growth for stores open at least one year over the comparable prior year period 
we consider comparable store sales to be an important indicator of our current performance 
comparable store sales results are important to achieve leveraging of our costs  including store payroll  store supplies and rent 
comparable store sales also have a direct impact on our total net sales  cash and working capital 
gross profit 
gross profit measures whether we are optimizing the price and inventory levels of our merchandise 
gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold 
any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups or any significant increase in our use of markdowns could have an adverse effect on our gross profit and results of operations 
operating profit 
we view operating profit as a key indicator of our success 
the key drivers of operating profit are comparable store sales  gross profit  our ability to control selling  general and administrative expenses and our level of capital expenditures affecting depreciation expense 
store productivity 
we review our stores operating profit as a measure of their profitability 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv item  exhibits and consolidated financial statements  of this annual report on form k 
we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions valuation of merchandise inventories we value our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value through the establishment of write down and inventory loss reserves 
our write down reserve represents the excess of the carrying value over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sales or other disposal of the inventory 
write downs establish a new cost basis for our inventory 
subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the restoration of previously recorded write downs or an increase in that newly established cost basis 
our inventory loss reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses shrinkage reserve that have occurred since the last physical inventory dates 
each quarter  we reserve for anticipated physical inventory losses on an aggregate basis 
our write down reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions based on the current rate of sales  the age of inventory  the profitability of the inventory and other factors 
our inventory loss reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including historical percentages that can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to calculate our write down and inventory loss reserves in the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory reserves 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a decrease in ultimate sales price at january  would have affected net income by million in fiscal a difference in actual physical inventory shrinkage reserved at january  would have affected net income by million in fiscal fixed assets we review the carrying value of our fixed assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by comparing projected individual store discounted cash flow to the asset carrying values 
declines in projected store cash flow could result in the impairment of assets 
the actual economic lives of our fixed assets may be different from our estimated useful lives  thereby resulting in a different carrying value 
these evaluations could result in a change in the depreciable lives of these assets and therefore our depreciation expense in future periods 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting future sales  gross profit and operating expenses and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
our fixed assets accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make estimates with respect to the useful lives of our fixed assets that we believe are reasonable 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  our operating results could be adversely affected 
although management believes that the current useful lives estimates assigned to our fixed assets are reasonable  factors could cause us to change our estimates  thus affecting the future calculation of depreciation 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon purchase at our retail store locations 
for orders placed through our website  revenue is recognized upon estimated delivery to the customer 
revenue is recorded net of estimated and actual sales returns and deductions for promotions 
revenue is not recorded on the sale of gift cards 
a current liability is recorded upon sale  and revenue is recognized when the gift card is redeemed for merchandise 
the amount of the gift card liability is determined taking into account our estimate of the portion of gift cards that will not be redeemed or recovered gift card breakage 
gift card breakage is recognized as revenue after months  at which time the likelihood of redemption is considered remote based on our historical redemption data 
our revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions regarding future sales returns and the amount and timing of gift cards projected to be redeemed by gift card recipients 
our estimate of the amount and timing of sales returns and gift cards to be redeemed is based primarily on historical transaction experience 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to measure sales returns or recognize revenue for our gift card program in the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our sales return reserve at january  would have affected net income by less than million in fiscal a change in our unredeemed gift card breakage life at january  would have affected net income by million in fiscal stock based compensation we maintain the zumiez inc equity incentive plan under which non qualified stock options and restricted stock have been granted to employees and non employee directors 
in determining the fair value of our stock options  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires management to apply judgment and make assumptions to determine the fair value of our awards 
we determine the fair value of our restricted stock awards based on the closing market price of our stock on the grant date 
the calculation of stock based compensation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the inputs to the black scholes option pricing model  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material 
a change in our stock based compensation expense in fiscal would have affected net income by million in fiscal accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the financial statements  income taxes are estimated for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on the consolidated balance sheets 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
for example  our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax  accounting and other laws  regulations  principles and interpretations 
although management believes that the income tax related judgments and estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
upon income tax audit  any unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions accounting for contingencies we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits  insurance  regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business 
we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable  or if an estimate is not determinable  we provide disclosure of a material claim or contingency in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our claims and contingencies  including determining the probability that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability is reasonably estimable 
the estimated accruals for claims and contingencies are made based on the best information available  which can be highly subjective 
although management believes that the contingencies related judgments and estimates are reasonable  our accrual for claims and contingencies could fluctuate as additional information becomes known  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
additionally  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change to suggest that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses  considering other publicly available market information  and where appropriate  by use of an independent valuation firm 
we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations 
if the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment 
we estimate fair value using discounted cash flows 
forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate economic factors and the profitability of future business operations 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
a decrease in the fair value of the company at january  would have no impact on the carrying value of goodwill

our stores west of texas  which accounted for of our comparable store sales  increased by  our stores in the northeast and midwest increased by combined and the remaining increase in comparable store sales is due to increases in our ecommerce sales 
the increase in comparable stores sales was primarily driven by an increase in comparable store transactions  partially offset by a decline in dollars per transaction 
comparable store sales increases in men s apparel  accessories  footwear  boy s apparel and junior s apparel were partially offset by comparable store sales decreases in hardgoods 
for information as to how we define comparable stores  see general above

we believe that we will be more effective distributing our products through a distribution center located in corona  california due to the majority of our vendors being located in southern california 
cumulatively  during fiscal  we have recorded million of employee benefit costs severance and performance bonuses  million of lease termination costs  million of loss on disposal of long lived assets and million of other costs to exit the

new stores generally open with lower revenues than stores that have been open greater than one year  but a majority of new store operating costs are not meaningfully lower than stores greater than one year old 
as a result  these stores contribute to higher sg a as a percent to sales 
seasonality and quarterly results as is the case with many retailers of apparel and related merchandise  our business is subject to seasonal influences 
as a result  we have historically experienced  and expect to continue to experience  seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in our net sales and operating results 
our net sales and operating results are typically lower in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year  while the back to school and winter holiday periods in our third and fourth fiscal quarters historically have accounted for the largest percentage of our annual net sales 
quarterly 
table of contents results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of store openings and the relative proportion of our new stores to mature stores  fashion trends and changes in consumer preferences  calendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods  changes in merchandise mix  timing of promotional events  general economic conditions  competition and weather conditions 
the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for the last two recent fiscal years 
the unaudited quarterly information has been prepared on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein and includes all adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown 
this information should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the operating results for any fiscal quarter are not indicative of the operating results for a full fiscal year or for any future period and there can be no assurance that any trend reflected in such results will continue in the future

historically  our main sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations 
the significant components of our working capital are inventory and liquid assets such as cash  cash equivalents  current marketable securities and receivables  reduced by accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or within several days of the related sale  while we typically have longer payment terms with our vendors 
at january  and january   we held one million par value auction rate security valued at million  net of a million temporary impairment charge 
the million security failed to sell at its 
table of contents scheduled auction in march and march in march  the interest rate for the security reset to a prescribed tax free rate of from 
we previously held another million auction rate security that was redeemed at par in may we currently do not intend to hold the security beyond the next auction date and will try to sell this security when the auction date comes up in march however  the uncertainties in the credit markets have prevented us and other investors from liquidating holdings of auction rate securities in auctions for these securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
if the march auction fails  we plan to hold the security until the next auction date and the security coupon rate will reset to a prescribed failure rate 
an unsuccessful auction could result in our holding the security beyond the next scheduled auction reset date  therefore  limiting the short term liquidity of the investment 
the security has been classified as available for sale marketable securities and included in long term investments on the consolidated balance sheets at january  and january  at january  and january   cash  cash equivalents and current marketable securities were million and million 
working capital  the excess of current assets over current liabilities  was million at the end of fiscal  up from million at the end of fiscal the increase in cash  cash equivalents and current marketable securities and working capital in fiscal were due primarily to the increased cash flow from operations driven primarily by an increase in net income  partially offset by the costs of opening stores in fiscal and the purchase of our distribution center in corona  california 
the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years in thousands fiscal year ended january  january  january  total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers  offset by cash payments we make for inventory  employee compensation  store occupancy expenses and other operational expenditures 
cash received from our customers generally corresponds to our net sales 
because our customers primarily use credit cards or cash to buy from us  our receivables from customers settle quickly 
changes to our operating cash flows have historically been driven primarily by changes in operating income and changes to the components of working capital  as well as changes to non cash items such as deferred taxes  depreciation  amortization and accretion and excess tax benefit from stock based compensation 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to changes in working capital  partially offset by a decrease in net income in fiscal compared to investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal primarily related to capital expenditures of million for new store openings  existing store renovations and the purchase of our new distribution center in corona  california and by net purchases of marketable securities of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal primarily related to capital expenditures for new

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million related to proceeds from stock option exercise and the associated tax benefits 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million related to proceeds from stock option exercise and the associated tax benefits 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million primarily related to short term use of bank funds partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercise and associated tax benefits 
sources of liquidity our most significant sources of liquidity continue to be funds generated by operating activities  available cash  cash equivalents and current marketable securities 
we expect these sources of liquidity and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash requirements for operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
beyond this time frame  if cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility are not sufficient to meet our capital requirements  then we will be required to obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available to us when we need it or  if available  that the terms will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then current shareholders 
we renewed and amended our secured credit agreement with wells fargo hsbc trade bank  na  on june   and the prior facility agreement was terminated 
the credit agreement provides us with a secured revolving credit facility until september  of up to million 
the secured revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of a standby letter of credit in an amount not to exceed million outstanding at any time and with a term not to exceed days 
the commercial line of credit provides for the issuance of a commercial letter of credit in an amount not to exceed million and with terms not to exceed days 
the amount of borrowings available at any time under our secured revolving credit facility is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding at that time 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the secured revolving credit facility at january  or january  we had open commercial letters of credit outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility of million and million at january  and january  the secured revolving credit facility bears interest at the daily one month libor rate plus 
the credit agreement contains a number of restrictions and covenants that generally limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional debt  undergo a change in ownership and enter into certain transactions 
the credit agreement also contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain specified financial tests and ratios  including  a maximum net loss not to exceed million after taxes on a trailing four quarter basis provided  that  there shall be added to net income all charges for impairment of goodwill and store assets not to exceed million in aggregate  and a minimum quick ratio of 
the quick ratio is defined as our cash and near cash equivalents plus certain defined receivables divided by the outstanding borrowings 
all of our personal property  including  among other things  our inventory  equipment and fixtures  has been pledged to secure our obligations under the credit agreement 
we must also provide financial information and statements to our lender 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at january  capital expenditures our capital requirements include construction and fixture costs related to the opening of new stores and remodeling expenditures for existing stores 
future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the pace of new store openings  the availability of suitable locations for new stores and the nature of arrangements negotiated with landlords 
in that regard  our net investment to open a new store has varied significantly in the past due to a number of factors  including the geographic location and size of the new store  and is likely to vary significantly in the future 

table of contents during fiscal  we spent million on capital expenditures  related to investment in new stores and remodeled stores at a cost of million  the acquisition and build out costs of our new distribution center in corona  california of million  the acquisition costs of million for land in lynnwood  washington  which we plan to use as the location of our new home office and million in information technology projects and other improvements 
during fiscal  we spent million on capital expenditures  related to investment in new stores and remodeled stores at a cost of million and million in information technology projects and other improvements 
during fiscal  we spent million on capital expenditures  related to investment in new stores and remodeled stores at a cost of million and million in information technology projects and other improvements 
in upcoming fiscal  we expect to spend approximately million to million on capital expenditures  a majority of which will relate to leasehold improvements and fixtures for the new stores we plan to open in fiscal and construction of our new home office building in lynnwood  washington 
there can be no assurance that the number of stores that we actually open in fiscal will not be different from the number of stores we plan to open  or that actual fiscal capital expenditures will not differ from this expected amount 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations during the fiscal year ended january  the following table summarizes the total amount of future payments due under our contractual obligations at january  in thousands total fiscal fiscal and fiscal fiscal and fiscal thereafter operating lease obligations purchase obligations total we occupy our retail stores and combined home office and ecommerce fulfillment center under operating leases generally with terms of five to ten years 
at january   we were committed to property owners for operating lease obligations for million 
a majority of our leases provide for ongoing co tenancy requirements or early cancellation clauses that would further lower rental rates  or permit lease terminations  or both  in the event that co tenants cease to operate for specific periods or if certain sales levels are not met in specific periods 
most of the store leases require payment of a specified minimum rent and a contingent rent based on a percentage of the store s net sales in excess of a specified threshold 
amounts in the above table do not include percentage rent  common area maintenance charges or real estate taxes unless these costs are fixed and determinable 
at january   we had outstanding purchase orders to acquire merchandise from vendors for million  including million of letters of credit outstanding 
we have an option to cancel these commitments with no notice prior to shipment  except for private label purchase orders in which we are obligated to repay certain contractual amounts upon cancellation 
off balance sheet obligations we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements at january  
table of contents impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our net sales or operating results for the past three fiscal years 
there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future

however  due to the relatively short maturity period of those investments and our intention and ability to hold those investments until maturity  the risk of material market value fluctuations is not expected to be significant 
during different times of the year  due to the seasonality of our business  we may borrow under our revolving credit facility 
to the extent we borrow under our revolving credit facility  which bears interest at the daily one month libor rate plus  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
at january   we had no borrowings outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility 
at january   we had million of open commercial letters of credit outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility 
we are not a party to any derivative financial instruments 
fluctuations in interest rates did not have a material effect on the results of operations in fiscal interest rate risk our earnings are affected by changes in market interest rates as a result of our short term and long term investments  which are primarily invested in state and local municipal securities  us treasury securities  us agency securities and variable rate demand notes  which have long term nominal maturity dates but feature variable interest rates that reset at short term intervals 
if our current portfolio average yield rate decreased by in fiscal  our net income would have decreased by million 
our current expectation is that our investment yields will remain low in due to historically low interest rates 
this amount is determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical yield rates on our cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investment balances 
this analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall investments that could happen in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our investments structure
