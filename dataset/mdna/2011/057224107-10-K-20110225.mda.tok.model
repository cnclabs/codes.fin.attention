o intelligent production systems includes products and services used to monitor and dynamically control the production from individual wells or fields including production decisions services  chemical injection services  well monitoring services  intelligent well systems  and artificial lift monitoring 
o artificial lift includes electric submersible pumps systems  progressing cavity pump systems  gas lift systems  and surface horizontal pumping systems used to lift large volumes of oil and water when a reservoir is no longer able to flow on its own 
o upstream chemicals includes chemicals and chemical application systems to provide flow assurance  integrity management and production management for upstream hydrocarbon production 
o pressure pumping services includes cementing  stimulation and coil tubing services used in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and in remedial work on existing wells  both onshore and offshore 
industrial services and other industrial services and other consists of our downstream chemicals  process and pipeline services  and stimulation chemicals 
it also includes our reservoir technology and consulting group that provides consulting services and software products  including the gaffney  cline and associates reservoir consulting services 
marketing  contracting  competition and economic conditions we market our products and services on a product line basis primarily through our own sales organizations 
we ordinarily provide technical and advisory services to assist in our customers use of our products and services 
stock points and service centers for our products and services are located in areas of drilling and production activity throughout the world 
our customers include the large integrated major and super major oil and natural gas companies  us and international independent oil and gas companies  and the national oil companies 
no single customer accounts for more than of our business 
in north america  most work is contracted and performed on a well by well basis 
outside north america  most work is contracted on a project by project basis or for an extended period of time  typically two to four years 
most contracts cover our pricing of the products and services  but do not necessarily establish an obligation to use our products and services 
our primary competitors include the major diversified oil service companies such as schlumberger  halliburton and weatherford  where the breadth of service capabilities as well as competitive position of each product line are the keys to differentiation in the market 
we also compete with other companies who may participate in only a few product lines  for example  national oilwell varco  champion technologies  inc  nalco holding company  newpark resources  inc  and frac tech services  llc 
our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets  and revenues and earnings can be affected by changes in competitive prices  fluctuations in the level of drilling  workover and completion activity in major markets  general economic conditions  foreign currency exchange fluctuations and governmental regulations 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our industries are product and service quality  availability and reliability  health  safety and environmental standards  technical proficiency and price 
we strive to negotiate the terms of our customer contracts consistent with what we consider to be best practices 
the general industry practice is for oilfield service providers  like us  to be responsible for their own products and services and for our customers to retain liability for drilling and related operations 
consistent with this practice  we generally take responsibility for our own people and property and our customers  such as the operator of a well  take responsibility for their own people  property and all liabilities related to the well and subsurface operations  regardless of either party s negligence 
in general  any material limitations on indemnifications to us from our customers in support of this allocation of responsibility arise only by applicable statutes 
certain states such as texas  louisiana  wyoming  and new mexico have enacted oil and gas specific statutes that void any indemnity agreement that attempts to relieve a party from liability resulting from its own negligence anti indemnity statutes 
these statutes can void the allocation of liability agreed to in a contract  however  both the texas and louisiana anti indemnity statutes include important exclusions 
the louisiana statute does not apply to property damage  and the texas statute allows mutual indemnity agreements that are supported by insurance and has exclusions  which include  among other things  loss or liability for property damage that results from pollution and the cost of control of a wild well 
because both baker hughes and our customers generally prefer to contract on the basis as we mutually agree  we negotiate with our customers in the us to include a choice of law provision adopting the law of a state that does not have an anti indemnity statute 
when this does not occur  we will generally use texas law 
with the exclusions contained in the texas anti indemnity statute  we are usually able to structure the contract such that the limitation on the indemnification obligations of the customer is limited and should not have a material impact on the terms of the contract 
state law  laws or public policy in countries outside the us  or the negotiated terms of our agreement with the customer may also limit the customer s indemnity obligations in the event of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of a baker hughes employee 
the company and the customer may also agree to other limitations on the customer s indemnity obligations in the contract 
the company maintains a commercial general liability insurance policy program that covers against certain operating hazards  including product liability claims and personal injury claims  as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which the company is liable  but clean up and well control costs are not covered by such program 
all of the insurance policies purchased by the company are subject to self insured retention amounts for which we are responsible for payment  specific terms  conditions  limitations and exclusions 
there can be no assurance that the nature and amount of company insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities related to our business 
research and development  patents our products and technology organization engages in research and development activities directed primarily toward the improvement of existing products and services  the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs and the development of new products  processes and services 
our primary technology centers are located in the us blacksburg  virginia  claremore  oklahoma  several in houston  texas and surrounding areas  germany celle  brazil rio de janeiro  russia novosibirsk  and saudi arabia dhahran 
for information regarding the amounts of research and development expense in each of the three years in the period ended december   see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item herein 
we have followed a policy of seeking patent and trademark protection in numerous countries and regions throughout the world for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance 
we believe our patents and trademarks to be adequate for the conduct of our business  and aggressively pursue protection of our patents against patent infringement worldwide 
no single patent or trademark is considered to be critical to our business 
seasonality our operations can be affected by seasonal weather  which can temporarily affect the delivery and performance of our products and services  as well as customers budgetary cycles 
the widespread geographic locations of our operations and the timing of seasonal events serve to reduce the impact of individual events 
examples of seasonal events which can impact our business include the severity and duration of both the summer and the winter in north america can have a significant impact on gas storage levels and drilling activity for natural gas 
in canada  the timing and duration of the spring thaw directly affects activity levels beginning late in the first quarter and most severely in the second quarter 
hurricanes can disrupt coastal and offshore drilling and production operations 
severe weather during the winter months normally results in reduced activity levels in the north sea and russia generally in the first quarter 
scheduled repair and maintenance of offshore facilities in the north sea can reduce activity in the second and third quarters 
our industrial services and other segment records its strongest sales in the second and third quarters of the year and weakest sales during the first and fourth quarters of the year due to the northern hemisphere winter 
raw materials we purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in manufacturing our products 
the principal materials we purchase are steel alloys including chromium and nickel  titanium  beryllium  copper  lead  tungsten carbide  synthetic and natural diamonds  guar  sand and other proppants  printed circuit boards and other electronic components and hydrocarbon based chemical feed stocks 
these materials are generally available from multiple sources and may be subject to price volatility 
we have not experienced significant shortages of these materials and normally do not carry inventories of such materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production schedules 
we do not expect significant interruptions in supply  but there can be no assurance that there will be no price or supply issues over the long term 
employees on december   we had approximately  employees  of which the majority are outside the us less than of these employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements or similar type labor arrangements 
based upon the geographic diversification of these employees  we believe any risk of loss from employee strikes or other collective actions would not be material to the conduct of our operations taken as a whole

environmental matters we are committed to the health and safety of people  protection of the environment and compliance with laws  regulations and our policies 
our past and present operations include activities that are subject to domestic including us federal  state and local and international regulations with regard to air and water quality and other environmental matters 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with these regulations 
regulation in this area continues to evolve  and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations  as well as the enactment and enforcement of new legislation  may require us and our customers to modify  supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation 
we are involved in voluntary remediation projects at some of our present and former manufacturing locations or other facilities  the majority of which relate to properties obtained in acquisitions or to sites no longer actively used in operations 
on rare occasions  remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agency issued consent decree or agreed order 
estimated remediation costs are accrued using currently available facts  existing environmental permits  technology and presently enacted laws and regulations 
for sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation  our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted 
we record accruals when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation  remediation or related activities  and such amounts can be reasonably estimated 
in general  we seek to accrue costs for the most likely scenario  where known 
accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation 
ongoing environmental compliance costs  such as obtaining environmental permits  installation of pollution control equipment and waste disposal  are expensed as incurred 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act known as superfund or cercla imposes liability for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault  even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and regulations 
the united states environmental protection agency the epa and appropriate state agencies supervise investigative and cleanup activities at superfund sites 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp in remedial activities related to various superfund sites  and we accrue our share of the estimated remediation costs of the site based on the ratio of the estimated volume of waste we contributed to the site to the total volume of waste disposed at the site 
prps in superfund actions have joint and several liability for all costs of remediation 
accordingly  a prp may be required to pay more than its proportional share of such costs 
for some projects  it is not possible to quantify our ultimate exposure because the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage  or allocation information is not yet available 
however  based upon current information  we do not believe that probable or reasonably possible expenditures in connection with the sites are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements because we have recorded adequate reserves to cover the estimate we presently believe will be our ultimate liability in the matter 
further  other prps involved in the sites have substantial assets and may reasonably be expected to pay their share of the cost of remediation  and  in some circumstances  we have insurance coverage or contractual indemnities from third parties to cover a portion of the ultimate liability 
based upon current information  we believe that our overall compliance with environmental regulations including routine environmental compliance costs and capital expenditures for environmental control equipment will not have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our cost for that compliance is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements 
our total accrual for environmental remediation is million and million  which includes accruals of million and million for the various superfund sites  at december  and  respectively 
approximately million of our total environmental accrual at december  relates to properties or liabilities acquired in connection with the bj services acquisition 
we are subject to various other governmental proceedings and regulations  including foreign regulations  relating to environmental matters  but we do not believe that any of these matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we continue to focus on reducing future environmental liabilities by maintaining appropriate company standards and improving our assurance programs 
item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves various risks 
when considering an investment in our company  one should consider carefully all of the risk factors described below  as well as other information included and incorporated by reference in this report 
there may be additional risks  uncertainties and matters not listed below  that we are unaware of  or that we currently consider immaterial 
any of these could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows and  thus  the value of an investment in our company 
risk factors related to the worldwide oil and natural gas industry our business is focused on providing products and services to the worldwide oil and natural gas industry  therefore  our risk factors include those factors that impact  either positively or negatively  the markets for oil and natural gas 
expenditures by our customers for exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas are based on their expectations of future hydrocarbon demand  the risks associated with developing the reserves  their ability to finance exploration for and development of reserves  and the future value of the reserves 
their evaluation of the future value is based  in part  on their expectations for global demand  global supply  excess production capacity  inventory levels  and other factors that influence oil and natural gas prices 
the key risk factors we believe are currently influencing the worldwide oil and natural gas markets are discussed below 
demand for oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control  which may adversely affect our operating results 
changes in the global economy or changes in the ability of our customers to access equity or credit markets could impact our customers spending levels and our revenues and operating results 
demand for oil and natural gas  as well as the demand for our services  is highly correlated with global economic growth  and in particular by the economic growth of countries such as the us  india  and china  as well as developing countries in asia and the middle east who are either significant users of oil and natural gas or whose economies are experiencing the most rapid economic growth compared to the global average 
the past slowdown in global economic growth and recession in the developed economies resulted in reduced demand for oil and natural gas  increased spare productive capacity and lower energy prices 
weakness or deterioration of the global economy or credit market could reduce our customers spending levels and reduce our revenues and operating results 
incremental weakness in global economic activity  particularly in china  india  the middle east and developing countries in asia will reduce demand for oil and natural gas and result in lower oil and natural gas prices 
incremental strength in global economic activity in such areas will create more demand for oil and natural gas and support higher oil and natural gas prices 
in addition  demand for oil and natural gas could be impacted by environmental regulation  including cap and trade legislation  carbon taxes and the cost for carbon capture and sequestration related regulations 
volatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services 
volatility in oil and natural gas prices can also impact our customers activity levels and spending for our products and services 
current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities 
expectations about future prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels 
lower oil and gas prices generally lead to decreased spending by our customers 
while higher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers  sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth  and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers 
our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher returns for individual projects if there is higher perceived risk 
any of these factors could affect the demand for oil and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our customers activity levels and spending for our products and services and ability to pay amounts owed us could be impacted by economic conditions 
access to capital is dependent on our customers ability to access the funds necessary to develop economically attractive projects based upon their expectations of future energy prices  required investments and resulting returns 
limited access to external sources of funding has and may continue to cause customers to reduce their capital spending plans to levels supported by internally generated cash flow 
in addition  a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices  a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve based credit facilities or the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us 
supply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control  which may adversely affect our operating results 
productive capacity for oil and natural gas is dependent on our customers decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves 
the ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed  as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells 
advanced technologies  such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  improve total recovery but also result in a more rapid production decline 
access to prospects is also important to our customers 
access to prospects may be limited because host governments do not allow access to the reserves or because another oil and natural gas exploration company owns the rights to develop the prospect 
government regulations and the costs incurred by oil and natural gas exploration companies to conform to and comply with government regulations  may also limit the quantity of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced 
supply can also be impacted by the degree to which individual organization of petroleum exporting countries opec nations and other large oil and natural gas producing countries  including  but not limited to  norway and russia  are willing and able to control production and exports of oil  to decrease or increase supply and to support their targeted oil price while meeting their market share objectives 
any of these factors could affect the supply of oil and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
changes in spare productive capacity or inventory levels can be indicative of future customer spending to explore for and develop oil and natural gas which in turn influences the demand for our products and services 
spare productive capacity and oil and natural gas storage inventory levels are an indicator of the relative balance between supply and demand 
high or increasing storage or inventories generally indicate that supply is exceeding demand and that energy prices are likely to soften 
low or decreasing storage or inventories are an indicator that demand is growing faster than supply and that energy prices are likely to rise 
measures of maximum productive capacity compared to demand spare productive capacity are also an important factor influencing energy prices and spending by oil and natural gas exploration companies 
when spare productive capacity is low compared to demand  energy prices tend to be higher and more volatile reflecting the increased vulnerability of the entire system to disruption 
seasonal and adverse weather conditions adversely affect demand for our services and operations 
weather can also have a significant impact on demand as consumption of energy is seasonal  and any variation from normal weather patterns  cooler or warmer summers and winters  can have a significant impact on demand 
adverse weather conditions  such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico  may interrupt or curtail our operations  or our customers operations  cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities  which may or may not be insured 
extreme winter conditions in canada  russia or the north sea may interrupt or curtail our operations  or our customers operations  in those areas and result in a loss of revenue 
risk factors related to our business our expectations regarding our business are affected by the following risk factors and the timing of any of these risk factors we operate in a highly competitive environment  which may adversely affect our ability to succeed 
we operate in a highly competitive environment for marketing oilfield services and securing equipment and trained personnel 
our ability to continually provide competitive products and services can impact our ability to defend  maintain or increase prices for our products and services  maintain market share and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers 
in order to be competitive  we must provide new technologies and reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value for our customers 
our ability to defend  maintain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industry s capacity relative to customer demand  and on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitors products and services 
in addition  our ability to negotiate acceptable contract terms and conditions with our customers  especially state owned national oil companies  our ability to manage warranty claims and our ability to effectively manage our commercial agents can also impact our results of operations 
managing development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at forecasted costs can impact our financial results 
development of competing technology that accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services can have a detrimental impact on our financial results 
we may be disadvantaged competitively and financially by a significant movement of exploration and production operations to areas of the world in which we are not currently active 
the high cost or unavailability of infrastructure  materials  equipment  supplies and personnel  particularly in periods of rapid growth  could adversely affect our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis 
our manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials  component parts and manufacturing capacity available to meet our manufacturing plans at a reasonable cost while minimizing inventories 
our ability to effectively manage our manufacturing operations and meet these goals can have an impact on our business  including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans and revenue goals  control costs and avoid shortages of raw materials and component parts 
raw materials and components of particular concern include steel alloys including chromium and nickel  titanium  beryllium  copper  lead  tungsten carbide  synthetic and natural diamonds  guar  sand and other proppants  printed circuit boards and other electronic components and hydrocarbon based chemical feed stocks 
our ability to repair or replace equipment damaged or lost in the well can also impact our ability to service our customers 
a lack of manufacturing capacity could result in increased backlog  which may limit our ability to respond to short lead time orders 
people are a key resource to developing  manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers around the world 
our ability to manage the recruiting  training and retention of the highly skilled workforce required by our plans and to manage the associated costs could impact our business 
a well trained  motivated work force has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business 
periods of rapid growth present a challenge to us and our industry to recruit  train and retain our employees while managing the impact of wage inflation and potential lack of available qualified labor in the markets where we operate 
likewise  when there is a downturn in the economy or our markets  we may have to adjust our workforce to control costs and yet not lose our skilled and diverse workforce 
labor related actions  including strikes  slowdowns and facility occupations can also have a negative impact on our business 
our business is subject to geopolitical  terrorism risks and other threats 
geopolitical and terrorism risks continue to grow in several key countries where we do business 
geopolitical and terrorism risks could lead to  among other things  a loss of our investment in the country  impair the safety of our employees and impair our ability to conduct our operations 
our informational technology systems are subject to possible breaches and other threats that could threaten our intellectual property  impair our ability to conduct our operations and cause other damages or loss 
our failure to comply with the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa would have a negative impact on our ongoing operations 
we entered into settlements with the doj and sec in april relating to violations of the fcpa by the company 
our ability to comply with the fcpa is dependent on the success of our ongoing compliance program  including our ability to continue to manage our agents and business partners and supervise  train and retain competent employees and the efforts of our employees to comply with applicable law and the baker hughes business code of conduct 
we would be subject to severe sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties in the event of a finding of an additional violation of the fcpa by us or any of our employees 
compliance with and changes in laws or adverse positions taken by taxing authorities could be costly and could affect operating results 
we have operations in the us and in over countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate 
our ability to manage our compliance costs and compliance programs will impact our ability to meet our earnings goals 
compliance related issues could also limit our ability to do business in certain countries 
changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation  new regulations  new policies  investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations  in particular  changes in export control laws or exchange control laws  additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions  and changes in laws in countries where we operate or intend to operate 
changes that impact the business environment include changes in accounting standards  changes in environmental laws  changes in tax laws or tax rates  the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities  and the ability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits 
in addition  we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization 
if taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings  our effective tax rate could be materially impacted 
these changes could have a significant financial impact on our future operations and the way we conduct  or if we conduct  business in the affected countries 
the may prior moratorium on drilling offshore in the us  as well as changes in and compliance with restrictions or regulations on offshore drilling in the us gulf of mexico and in other areas around the world  has and may continue to adversely affect our business and operating results and reduce the need for our services in those areas 
while the moratorium on drilling offshore in the us was lifted on october   there is a delay in resuming permitting of operations related to drilling offshore in the us and there is no assurance that operations related to drilling offshore in the us will reach the same levels that existed prior to the moratorium 
the delay in resuming these activities or the failure of these activities to reach levels that existed prior to the moratorium has and could continue to adversely impact our operating results 
the april deepwater horizon accident in the gulf of mexico and its aftermath has resulted in new and proposed legislation and regulation in the us of the offshore oil and gas industry  which may result in substantial increases in costs or delays in drilling or other operations in the gulf of mexico  oil and gas projects becoming potentially non economic  and a corresponding reduced demand for our services 
we cannot predict with any certainty the impact of the prior moratorium or the substance or effect of any new or additional regulations 
if the us or other countries where we operate  enact stricter restrictions on offshore drilling or further regulate offshore drilling or contracting services operations  including without limitation cementing  higher operating costs could result and adversely affect our business and operating results 
uninsured claims and litigation against us could adversely impact our operating results 
we could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings 
we have insurance coverage against operating hazards  including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products  to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available  however  no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation 
this insurance has deductibles or self insured retentions and contains certain coverage exclusions 
the insurance does not cover damages from breach of contract by us or based on alleged fraud or deceptive trade practices 
in addition  the following risks apply with respect to our insurance coverage we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms  we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance  our insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies  or the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits 
whenever possible  we obtain agreements from customers that limit our liability 
however  state law  laws or public policy in countries outside the us  or the negotiated terms of the agreement with the customer may not recognize those limitations of liability and or limit the customer s indemnity obligations to the company 
in addition  insurance and customer agreements do not provide complete protection against losses and risks from an event  like a well blow out that can lead to property damage  personal injury  death or the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by unexpected claims not covered by insurance 
compliance with and rulings and litigation in connection with environmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operating results 
our business is impacted by unexpected outcomes or material changes in environmental regulations 
our expectations regarding our compliance with environmental regulations and our expenditures to comply with environmental regulations  including without limitation our capital expenditures for environmental control equipment  are only our forecasts regarding these matters 
these forecasts may be substantially different from actual results  which may be affected by the following factors changes in environmental regulations  a material change in our allocation or other unexpected  adverse outcomes with respect to sites where we have been named as a prp  including without limitation superfund sites  the discovery of new sites of which we are not aware and where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental regulations  an unexpected discharge of hazardous materials 
international  national  and state governments and agencies are currently evaluating and promulgating climate related legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting greenhouse gas ghg emissions 
in the us  the epa has taken steps to regulate ghgs as pollutants under the clean air act caa 
the epa s mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule established a comprehensive scheme of regulations that require monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions that began in furthermore  the epa recently proposed additional ghg reporting rules specifically for the oil and gas industry 
the epa has also published a final rule  the endangerment finding  indicating that ghgs in the atmosphere endanger public health and welfare  and that emissions of ghgs from mobile sources cause or contribute to the ghg pollution 
following issuance of the endangerment finding  the epa promulgated final motor vehicle ghg emission standards on april  these developments may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services  which may in turn adversely affect future results of operations 
international developments focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide and other ghgs include the united nations framework convention on climate change  also known as the kyoto protocol an internationally applied protocol  which has been ratified in canada and the european union s emission trading system 
the carbon reduction commitment in the uk is the first cap and trade scheme to affect baker hughes facilities 
domestic cap and trade programs include the regional greenhouse gas initiative or in the northeastern united states  and the western regional climate action initiative in the western united states 
a federal cap and trade regime may develop in the us as well 
these developments may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services  which may in turn adversely affect future results of operations 
demand for pressure pumping services could be reduced or eliminated by governmental regulation or a change in the law 
the epa plans to study hydraulic fracturing practices  and legislation may be introduced in the us congress that would authorize the epa to regulate hydraulic fracturing 
in addition  a number of states are evaluating the adoption of legislation or regulations governing hydraulic fracturing 
such federal or state legislation and or regulations could impair our operations and or greatly reduce or eliminate demand for the company s pressure pumping services 
such legislation and or regulations  if enacted  could adversely affect future results of operations 
we are unable to predict whether the proposed legislation or any other proposals will ultimately be enacted  and if so  the impact on the company s business 
control of oil and gas reserves by state owned oil companies may impact the demand for our services and create additional risks in our operations 
much of the world s oil and gas reserves are controlled by state owned oil companies 
state owned oil companies may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards  such as joint ventures  that could be difficult or undesirable for the company to meet 
the failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely impact the company s operations in those countries 
in addition  many state owned oil companies may require integrated contracts or turn key contracts that could require the company to provide services outside its core business 
providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis generally requires the company to assume additional risks 
changes in economic conditions and currency fluctuations may impact our operating results 
fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar can impact our revenue and our costs of doing business 
most of our products and services are sold through contracts denominated in us dollars or local currency indexed to us dollars  however  some of our revenue  local expenses and manufacturing costs are incurred in local currencies and therefore changes in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies  particularly the british pound sterling  euro  canadian dollar  norwegian krone  russian ruble  australian dollar  brazilian real and the venezuelan bolivar which  for example  was devalued by the venezuelan government in january  can increase or decrease our revenue and expenses reported in us dollars and may impact our results of operations 
the condition of the capital markets and equity markets in general can affect the price of our common stock and our ability to obtain financing  if necessary 
if the company s credit rating is downgraded  this would increase borrowing costs under our revolving credit agreements and commercial paper program  as well as the cost of renewing or obtaining  or make it more difficult to renew or obtain or issue  new debt financing 
changes in market conditions may impact any stock repurchases 
to the extent the company engages in stock repurchases  such activity is subject to market conditions  such as the trading prices for our stock  as well as the terms of any stock purchase plans intended to comply with rule b or rule b of the exchange act 
management  in its discretion  may engage in or discontinue stock repurchases at any time 
the merger with bj services may create additional risks for the company 
the success of the merger will depend  in part  on our ability to realize certain anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of baker hughes and bj services 
however  to realize these anticipated benefits  we must successfully integrate the operations and personnel of bj services and our existing business 
if we are not able to achieve these objectives  the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 
failure to achieve the anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect our future business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 
during the year ended december   approximately one half of our revenue and approximately two thirds of our profit before tax were attributable to north america 
a decrease in demand for energy  natural gas exploration and production  or an increase in competition  in north america could result in a significant adverse effect on our operating results and the expected benefits of the merger 
prior to the merger  bj services voluntarily disclosed information found in its internal investigations to the department of justice doj and sec and engaged in discussions with these authorities in connection with their review of possible illegal payments 
the company cannot currently predict the outcome of these investigations  when any of these matters will be resolved  or what  if any  actions may be taken by the doj  the sec or other authorities or the effect the actions may have on the business or consolidated financial statements of the company 
if the doj or sec were to take action for failure to comply with the fcpa  it could significantly affect our results of operations 
in october of  the company made voluntary disclosures on behalf of bj services to the department of commerce and the department of state for potential export control violations that occurred prior to the merger 
the department of state has issued a letter that notified the company that they will not be taking any further action or imposing any penalty in relation to the disclosures that were filed with them 
it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome or penalty amounts that may be imposed by the department of commerce
