the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we design  manufacture and market a range of software and hardware storage systems for the entry and midrange storage markets 
beginning in the second half of  we began placing more emphasis on selling higher gross margin products which includes software  appliance products  and hardware products through indirect sales channels 
we have two operating segments  which include storage systems and standalone storage software 
typical customers for our storage systems operating segment  which includes our assuredsan line of storage array products  include organizations requiring high reliability  high performance networked storage and data management solutions in an open systems architecture 
our storage solutions consist of integrated hardware  firmware and software products employing a modular system that allows end users to add various protocol  performance  capacity or data protection schemes as needed 
our broad range of products  from small capacity direct attached to complete multi hundred terabyte  or tb  storage area networks  or sans  provide end users with a cost effective means of addressing increasing storage demands at compelling price performance points 
our current product family based on our assuredsan architecture provides high performance and large disk array capacities for a broad variety of environments  employing fibre channel  or fc  internet small computer systems interface  or iscsi or serial attached scsi  or sas  interconnects to switches and or hosts 
in addition  our assured family of data protection software products provides additional layers of data protection options to complement our line of storage disk arrays 
our current mainstream and series of entry level storage products and just a bunch of disks  or jbod  arrays are targeted primarily at mainstream enterprise and small to medium business  or smb  applications 
our assuredsan series products have been distinguished by certification as network equipment building system  or nebs  level a telecommunications standard for equipment used in central offices and are mil std f a military standard created by the us government compliant based on their ruggedness and reliability 
in february  we launched the latest assuredsan series of storage arrays that provide high speed interface options including gigabyte  or gb  fc  gb and gb iscsi over ethernet and gb sas connectivity 
our standalone storage software operating segment consists of our assureduvs and assuredvra product lines 

table of contents in november  we launched the assureduvs unified virtual storage appliance product line for our branded products through our indirect sales channels and we continue to sell the assureduvs software only to qualified oem accounts worldwide 
this product line  formerly known as the intelligent storage networking system  or isn tm  is based on the technology we acquired in january from cloverleaf communications  inc  or cloverleaf  a privately held software company focused on heterogeneous storage virtualization and unified storage technologies 
the appliance products consist of a standard off the shelf x server  combined with the proprietary software that delivers the unified virtual storage feature set 
our storage arrays are also available bundled with this appliance 
we believe this product line will broaden market opportunities in both oem and branded indirect sales channels and help accelerate our transition from a provider of hardware storage arrays to a provider of unified virtual storage solutions 
sales of assureduvs products were not significant in although we expect sales of our assureduvs products to increase  we do not expect such sales to represent a significant percentage of our total net revenue in in september  we acquired certain assets  namely raidcore from ciprico inc  or ciprico 
these products are marketed to oem accounts as the assuredvra product line 
this acquisition opened up new markets for us in the enterprise server and workstation markets for data protection internal to the servers and workstations 
in particular  the raidcore acquisition allows us to broaden our product portfolio in the redundant array of independent disks  or raid  market while allowing us to sell into the band market  and to pursue opportunities at current and target oem customers 
we signed our first customer agreement relating to raidcore products in may and began selling to this customer during the third quarter of sales of assuredvra products were not significant in although we expect sales of our assuredvra products to increase in  we do not expect such sales to represent a significant percentage of our total net revenue in we have decided to expand our routes to market beyond our focus on original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and in october of  we launched a dot hill channel program targeted at selling through distributors and open storage partners  or osps 
we continued to expand our channel program in and we believe this will provide dot hill with additional sales channels for all of our products 
the majority of sales to our channel partners were represented by our assuredsan line of products in we expect sales to our channel partners of our assuredsan and assureduvs products will increase in our agreements with our customers do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and may be terminated at any time upon notice from the applicable customer 
our ability to achieve and maintain profitability will depend on  among other things  the level and mix of orders we actually receive from such customers  the actual amounts we spend on marketing support  the actual amounts we spend for inventory support and incremental internal investment  our ability to reduce product cost  our product lead time  our ability to meet delivery schedules required by our customers and the economic environment 
our products and services are sold worldwide to facilitate server and san storage implementations  primarily through oems  and supplemented by system integrators  or sis  distributors and value added resellers  or vars 
our storage system operating segment oem partners currently include  among others  hewlett packard  or hp  lenovo  ericsson  motorola  inc  or motorola  general dynamics government systems corporation  or general dynamics  lockheed martin corporation  or lockheed martin  nec  tektronix inc  or tektronix  samsung electronics  or samsung  stratus technologies  or stratus  and fujitsu technology solutions gmbh  or fts 
our standalone storage software operating segment oem partners currently include  among others  dell inc  or dell  xiotech and computer dynamics  inc  or computer dynamics 
although our products and services are sold worldwide  the majority of our net revenue is derived from our us operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our operating segments and a breakout of our net revenue by geographical regions 
we began shipping products to hp in the fourth quarter of in january  we amended our agreement with hp to allow for sales of additional products to additional divisions within hp 
our products are 
table of contents primarily sold as hp s msa p product family 
sales to hp increased significantly during and increased again in primarily as a result of the successful launch and market acceptance of the hp msa products 
hp launched its third generation product line  now called the p product line  in february sales to hp increased again in as we began selling our next generation host interfaces across the hp p product line 
the agreement with hp does not contain any minimum purchase commitments 
sales to hp approximated of our total net revenue in  of our total net revenue in and of our total net revenue in we expect sales to hp to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue in we also expect sales to hp will represent a higher percentage of our total net revenue in we previously designed and developed general purpose disk arrays for a variety of products that were sold under private label by netapp  inc  or netapp 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to exit our low margin business with netapp and amended our agreement with netapp to allow them to manufacture and sell on a royalty free basis all of the products we previously manufactured and sold to them beginning on or about december  as a result  we currently do not anticipate generating any additional revenue from netapp 
we expect to generate additional revenue from our indirect channel sales and from sales of our assureduvs and assuredvra products as well as new and potential new oem customers to replace the revenue  and more importantly  the gross profit lost as a result of amending our agreement with netapp 
however  if we are unable to generate sufficient gross profit from these sources to largely replace the gross profit previously associated with netapp  our financial results could be harmed 
sales to netapp approximated of our total net revenue in  of our total net revenue in and of our total net revenue in  all of which was attributable to our storage systems operating segment 
we expect our total net revenue to decrease in compared to as a result of exiting our relationship with netapp 
in addition  the demand for our products has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following our ability to maintain and enhance relationships with our customers  in particular our oem customers  as well as our ability to win new business  the amount of field failures resulting in product replacements or recalls  our ability to launch new products in accordance with oem schedules and milestones  general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the continuing volatility in the technology sector  current general economic volatility and trends in the data storage markets in various geographic regions  the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory  and the inability of certain of our customers who depend on credit to have access to their traditional sources of credit to finance the purchase of products from us  particularly in the current global economic environment  which may lead them to reduce their level of purchases or to seek credit or other accommodations from us 
for these and other reasons  our net revenue and results of operations in and prior periods may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue and results of operations 
our manufacturing strategy includes outsourcing substantially all of our manufacturing to third party manufacturers in order to reduce sales cycle times and manufacturing infrastructure  enhance working capital and improve margins by taking advantage of the third parties manufacturing and procurement economies of scale 
in september  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with foxconn technology group  or foxconn 

table of contents under the terms of the agreement  foxconn supplies us with manufacturing  assembly and test services from its facilities in china and final integration services including final assembly  testing and configure to order services  through its worldwide facilities 
the agreement provides for an initial three year term that is automatically renewed at the end of such three year term for additional one year terms unless and until the agreement is terminated by either party 
foxconn began manufacturing products for us in july and we began shipping products for general availability under the foxconn agreement during the second half of the majority of our products sold in were manufactured by foxconn 
we expect foxconn to manufacture substantially all of our products in we derive the majority of our net revenue primarily from sales of our series and family of products  which are included in our assuredsan product line within the storage systems operating segment 
cost of goods sold includes costs of materials  subcontractor costs  salary and related benefits for the production and service departments  depreciation of equipment used in the production and service departments  production facility rent and allocation of overhead as well as manufacturing variances and freight 
research and development expenses consist primarily of project related expenses  consulting charges and salaries for employees directly engaged in research and development 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions  marketing related costs  advertising  customer related evaluation unit expenses  promotional costs and travel expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation to officers and employees performing administrative functions  expenditures for administrative facilities as well as expenditures for legal and accounting services and fluctuations in currency valuations 
other income is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
in the second quarter of  our management approved  committed to  and initiated a restructuring and cost reduction plan  or the plan  to better align our resources in order to lower our breakeven point 
the plan included severance and related costs for the reduction of approximately of our workforce  and fees associated with the acceleration of the closure of our carlsbad  california facility 
substantially all of our plan workforce reductions were completed by december  and we completely exited our carlsbad facility as of june  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on current facts  historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results  future results of operations will be affected 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates 
table of contents reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements 
we have many accounting policies that require us to make estimates and assumptions  the determination of useful lives of long lived assets  warranty reserves  accruals for estimated restructuring  tax and legal liabilities and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the items listed below are not inclusive of all of our accounting policies but is a listing  identified by management  of those policies which require the most significant judgments and estimates to be made in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from sales of our hardware products  software and services 
hardware product revenue consists of revenue from sales of our assuredsan storage systems and our assureduvs appliance products that includes our assureduvs software which is integrated with industry standard hardware which is essential to the functionality of the integrated system product 
we recognize hardware product revenue when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized for hardware product sales upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer and in addition  upon installation for certain of our assureduvs appliance products 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other factors known at the time 
if actual future returns and pricing adjustments differ from past experience and our estimates  additional revenue reserves may be required 
for our assureduvs licensed software products  we account for revenue in accordance with relevant software revenue recognition guidance 
we may also provide unspecified software updates and enhancements related to our assureduvs products through service contracts 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  for the fair value of our support services as measured by the stated renewal prices paid by our customers when the services are sold separately on a standalone basis 
net revenue derived from our assureduvs software products was not material for any period presented 
our service revenue primarily includes out of warranty repairs and product maintenance contracts 
out of warranty repairs primarily consist of product repair services performed by our contract manufacturers for those customers that allowed their original product warranty to expire without purchasing one of our higher level support service plans 
revenue from these out of warranty repairs  and the associated cost of sales  is recognized in the period these services are provided 
service revenue also consists of product maintenance contracts 
revenue from our product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term  generally to months 
net revenue derived from services was less than of total revenue for all periods presented 
from time to time  the company enters into arrangements with customers that include acceptance criteria 
in such instances  the company defers all revenue on the arrangement until customer acceptance is obtained or the acceptance clause lapses 
on sales to channel partners  we evaluate whether fees are considered fixed or determinable by considering a number of factors  including our ability to estimate returns  payment terms and our relationship and past history with the particular channel partner 
if fees are not considered fixed or determinable at the time of sale to a channel partner  revenue recognition is deferred until there is persuasive evidence indicating the product has sold through to an end user 
persuasive evidence of sell through may include reports from channel partners documenting sell through activity or data indicating an order has shipped to an end user 
we also defer revenue on upfront nonrefundable payments from our customers and recognize it ratably over the term of the agreement  unless the payment is in exchange for products delivered that represent the 
table of contents culmination of a separate earnings process 
when we provide consideration to a customer we recognize the value of that consideration as a reduction in net revenue 
we may be required to maintain inventory with certain of our largest oem customers  which we refer to as hubbing arrangements 
pursuant to these arrangements we deliver products to a customer or a designated third party warehouse based upon the customer s projected needs  but do not recognize product revenue unless and until the customer has removed our product from the warehouse to incorporate into its end products 
valuation of inventories inventories are comprised of finished goods and purchased parts and assemblies  which include direct labor and overhead  and are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market value 
the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate excess or obsolete inventory 
the determination of excess or obsolete inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products 
because our markets are volatile  are subject to technological risks  price changes and inventory reduction programs by our customers  and as we are required to make last time buys of certain components on occasion  there is a risk that we will forecast incorrectly and produce excess inventories of particular products or have commitments to purchase excess inventory components from our suppliers 
as a result  actual demand will differ from forecasts  and such a difference has in the past and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our gross margin and our results of operations 
any write downs to inventory due to the existence of excess quantities  physical obsolescence  changes in pricing  damage  or other causes establish a new cost basis for the inventory 
when we sell or dispose of reserved inventory the new cost basis is charged to cost of sales 
the largest factor affecting the accuracy of our provisions for excess inventories is the accuracy of our production and service forecasts of end customer demand 
the accuracy of our estimates depends in part on the accuracy of the non binding forecasts we get from our end customers  the accuracy of our own forecast of warranty requirements of our customers  the demand for storage systems in our market segments and the speed at which our products are designed in or out of our customers products 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation by measuring and recognizing share based compensation expense for equity based awards granted  including stock options  restricted stock awards  performance based restricted stock awards and employee stock purchase plan shares  for which expense will be recognized over the service period of the equity based award based on the fair value of the award  at the date of grant 
the estimation of stock option and employee stock purchase plan fair value requires management to make complex estimates and judgments about  among other things  employee exercise behavior  forfeiture rates and the volatility of our common stock 
these judgments directly affect the amount of compensation expense that will ultimately be recognized 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards is measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date fair value is calculated based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares granted  and is recognized as expense over the respective vesting period 
compensation expense for performance based restricted stock awards is measured similarly to restricted stock  however  compensation expense is only recorded for awards that ultimately vest  which is contingent upon employees achieving various performance criteria 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the fair values generated by the black scholes model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements as well as limited transferability 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we use historical volatility of our stock for the expected life of the grant as the expected volatility assumption required in the 
table of contents black scholes model 
our selection of the historical volatility approach is due to the limited availability of data regarding actively traded options on our stock 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock options on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  share based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned share based compensation expense 
valuation goodwill we perform an assessment of our goodwill for impairment annually at november  or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangibles require that we perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a second step must be performed  and the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill must be determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded 
all of our goodwill has been assigned to our israel reporting unit  which is one level below our standalone storage software operating segment 
we primarily utilized an income approach to estimate the fair value of the israel reporting unit 
we also performed other valuation techniques to corroborate the reasonableness of our fair value estimate under the income approach for our israel reporting unit 
our income approach involved performing a discounted cash flow analysis of the israel reporting unit and comparing the present value of such cash flows to its carrying value 
the most significant estimates and assumptions utilized in our discounted cash flow analysis involved revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
our annual goodwill impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge 
the excess of fair value over carrying value for the israel reporting unit as of november  approximated million 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair value of the israel reporting unit 
this hypothetical decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value of approximately million for the israel reporting unit 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets consist primarily of intangible assets with finite lives and property and equipment 
we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate and recognize an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the assets  if any  are less than the carrying value of the assets 
if an asset is deemed to be impaired  the amount of the impairment loss represents the excess of the asset s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value 
fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates  reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk 

table of contents as of december   we identified a change in circumstances that indicated the carrying amount of our long lived assets may not be recoverable due to the significant economic downturn at that time  which caused a substantial decline in our market capitalization 
as of december   the carrying value of our equity significantly exceeded our market capitalization 
our long lived assets at that time consisted of our identifiable intangible assets associated with our recent acquisition of certain identified ciprico assets acquired in september with a carrying value of million  our licensed patent portfolio of million and property and equipment of million 
based upon management s estimates of undiscounted cash flows  coupled with the recent acquisition of the ciprico assets which established fair value for the assets  we determined that the carrying value of the acquired ciprico assets approximates fair value and therefore no impairment was identified 
the remaining long lived assets with a carrying value of million were tested for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets were available 
we determined the fair value of the impaired assets by discounting the forecasted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate  based on management s best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections 
our impairment analysis as of december  identified million of impaired long lived assets consisting of million of property and equipment and our million licensed patent portfolio 
the long lived asset impairment is recorded as a separate component of operating expenses for the year ended december  no impairments of long lived assets were recognized for the years ended december  or business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over these fair values is recorded as goodwill 
we engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
the significant purchased intangible assets recorded by us include acquired software  developed technologies and a trade name 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired software and developed technologies  expected costs to internally develop acquired software  as well as assumptions about the period of time that acquired software  developed technologies and an acquired trade name will continue to be used and generate cash flows  and discount and royalty rates 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our statements of operations as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated percentages may not add due to rounding years ended december  net revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring charge legal settlement goodwill and long lived asset impairment charge total operating expenses operating loss other income  net loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages net revenue the increase in net revenue for the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in sales to hp 
sales to hp totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the for the year ended december  the increase in hp net revenue is due to the successful launch and market acceptance of the hp msa products  which includes our series products and the launch by hp of its third generation product line  now called the p product line  in february  which includes our series products 
although our series products are in the decline phase of the product life cycle  demand for these products continues to be significant 
we released our next generation series products in the first quarter of and sales of these products have increased significantly during each quarter of we expect sales to hp to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue in in addition  sales to netapp increased during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  based on the success of netapp s fas product line 
sales to netapp totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  however  under our agreement with netapp  netapp had the right to manufacture and sell  on a royalty and royalty free basis  up to certain specified percentages of the products we previously manufactured and sold to netapp 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to exit our low margin business with netapp and amended our agreement with netapp to allow netapp to manufacture and sell on a royalty free basis all of the products we previously manufactured and sold to netapp beginning on or about december  as a result  we currently do not anticipate generating any additional revenue from netapp 

table of contents we expect to generate additional revenue from our indirect channel sales and from sales of our assureduvs and assuredvra products as well as new and potential new oem customers to replace the revenue  and more importantly  the gross profit lost as a result of amending our agreement with netapp 
however  if we are unable to generate sufficient gross profit from these sources to largely replace the gross profit previously associated with netapp  our financial results could be harmed 
we also experienced an increase in net revenue of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result of the launch of our channel program in october of  sales of our assureduvs products  which are based on the technology acquired as part of the cloverleaf acquisition in january and increased sales of our assuredvra products as we renegotiated our contract with a major oem customer in these increases were partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from oracle  fts  sepaton and other smaller customers 
oracle sales decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decline in oracle net revenue is due to the products we sell to oracle reaching the end of their product life cycle 
fts sales decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net revenue from fts is due to fts s decision to internally source the product we sell to fts 
in addition  we also experienced a decline in sales to sepaton of approximately million as a result of sepaton buying their storage requirements from another source 
we also experienced a net decline in sales to other smaller customers of approximately million 
we expect our total net revenue to decrease in compared to as a result of exiting our relationship with netapp 
cost of goods sold and gross profit of net revenue of net revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages cost of goods sold gross profit cost of goods sold increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of an increase in sales 
gross profit margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to the continued success of our product cost reduction and value engineering initiatives over the past few years which has significantly reduced our costs for both our series and products that we sell to hp and other customers 
in addition  we incurred lower excess and obsolete inventory and scrap charges as a result of various product end of life issues experienced in and improved inventory management practices in we were also able to negotiate early payment and volume discounts in  which resulted in lower costs and a higher gross profit margin 
we also incurred fewer inventory holding charges as we were able to more efficiently manage inventories being held by our contract manufacturing partners and experienced a decrease in manufacturing overhead costs primarily as a result of our restructuring activities 
partially offsetting the increase in gross profit margin were higher amortization expense  warranty related expenses and freight costs for the year ended december  compared to the same period in warranty related expenses increased as a result of a higher volume of quality related warranty claims  as we experienced component failure issues with certain of our battery and hard disk drive suppliers  as well as firmware failures within one of our products 
additionally  freight costs increased as a result of the increase in revenue and overall shipment volume as well as from expedite charges 
amortization expense increased due to the inclusion of ciprico amortization in cost of goods sold as a result of the acquired products now generating revenue  as well as 
table of contents additional amortization resulting from the cloverleaf acquisition 
prior to  ciprico amortization was included in research and development expense 
our gross profit margin is typically sensitive to product and customer mix changes 
for example  our gross profit margin on sales of the products we sell to hp is higher than the gross profit margin on the products we previously sold to netapp 
conversely  the gross profit margin on sales of the products we previously sold to oracle is higher than that of the products we currently sell to hp 
in addition  sales of our software products and services typically have a much higher gross profit margin than that of our hardware products 
also  sales to our channel customers typically have a higher gross profit margin than sales to our oem customers 
for the year ended december   we generated a lower percentage of our net revenue from oracle  which had an unfavorable impact on our gross profit margin  however  we generated a higher percentage of our net revenue from our channel customers and from sales of software and services  which had a favorable impact on our gross profit margin 
we expect that our cost of sales will decrease and our gross profit margin will increase in as a result of exiting our relationship with netapp and as a result of expected increases in sales from our channel customers and from sales of software and services 
we also expect that the mix of products we sell  in particular  the products we sell to hp  will continue to affect our cost of goods sold and gross profit margin 
research and development expenses of net revenue of net revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages research and development expenses research and development expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and payroll related expenses of million  an increase in consulting costs of million  an increase in depreciation expense of million  and increases in various other items such as facilities and common expenses and travel  which approximated million 
in addition  in and  we determined it was probable that the amount of contingent consideration due to ciprico would be lower based on lower actual and projected sales of products eligible for the contingent consideration through the end of the contingent consideration period 
accordingly  we reduced the contingent consideration liability and research and development expense in the statement of operations to reflect the reduction in estimated contingent consideration liability 
the reduction to research and development expense approximated million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   or a change of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in ciprico intangible asset amortization expense of million and a decrease in engineering materials expense of million 
the increase in salary and payroll related expenses is primarily a result of the additional employees engaged in research and development activities associated with the cloverleaf acquisition 
consulting costs increased largely as a result of certain engineering functions being performed by consultants in india and an increase in the use of domestic engineering consultants to assist with certain strategic development projects 
the increase in depreciation expense was primarily the result of the additional equipment acquired in the cloverleaf acquisition and also due to additional capital expenditures for our longmont engineering labs 
ciprico intangible asset amortization expense decreased as the related assuredvra product is now generating revenue and therefore the amortization is included in cost of sales 
the decrease in engineering materials expense is largely the result of the timing of our engineering material purchases in conjunction with the release of our next generation series products  which occurred in the first quarter of 
table of contents sales and marketing expenses of net revenue of net revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in customer related evaluation product expenses of million  an increase in marketing research  public relations and promotional expenses of million  an increase in salaries and payroll related expenses of million  and an increase in travel expenses of million 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in facilities and common costs of million as a result of our restructuring activities 
the increase in customer related evaluation product expenses is due to new product releases in  including those products acquired in the cloverleaf acquisition

general and administrative expenses of net revenue of net revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in legal fees of million  changes in foreign currency gains and losses of million  a reduction in sarbanes oxley fees of million and a reduction in board of director fees of million 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in salaries and payroll related expenses of million and an increase in travel expenses of million 
the change in foreign currency gains and losses were primarily the result of changes in the value of the euro and british pound in relation to the united states dollar 
the reduction in legal fees was primarily the result of lower fees associated with litigation matters as certain claims against us were dismissed in the first quarter of the reduction in sarbanes oxley fees were primarily the result of negotiating lower fees with our service provider 
board of director fees decreased as a result of a reduction in the number of our board members 
salaries and payroll related expenses and travel expenses increased primarily as a result of our transition of certain of our administrative functions to longmont  colorado from carlsbad  california in  including the costs of duplicative personnel

for the year ended december   we incurred severance and related costs of million for various california employees whose positions have been relocated to colorado 
as part of the plan  we also incurred contract termination costs of million for the year ended december  primarily for facility lease and other associated costs that we continued to incur without economic benefit and due to revisions to our assumptions regarding the timing and amount of tenant sublease income 
in the second quarter of  our management approved  committed to  and initiated a restructuring and cost reduction plan  or the plan  to better align our resources in order to lower our breakeven point

the benefit from income taxes primarily represents federal tax credits  partially offset by state  local and foreign income taxes 
the federal tax credits available to us for the year ended december  were not available in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages net revenue 
table of contents the reduction in net revenue was substantially due to a decrease in sales volume and was primarily attributable to a decrease in net revenue from oracle  which sells our sannet ii family of products under the st brand product line 
our net revenue from oracle decreased in compared to and totaled of our total net revenue in and of our total net revenue in the decline in oracle net revenue was primarily due to the products we sell oracle nearing the end of their lifecycle 
we also experienced a reduction in net revenue from netapp in compared to primarily as a result of general economic conditions 
in addition  net revenue from fts decreased in compared to as a result of its decision to internally source the product we sell to fts 
we also believe that the economic recession had a negative impact on our revenue 
these reductions in net revenue were partially offset by an increase in net revenue from hp who sells a version of our series family of products within their msa product family 
our net revenue from hp totaled of our total net revenue in compared to of our total net revenue in the increase in hp net revenue is primarily due to the successful launch and market acceptance of the hp msa product in as well as the successful launch of follow on products in cost of goods sold and gross profit of net revenue of net revenue decrease increase change in thousands  except percentages cost of goods sold gross profit the decrease in cost of goods sold and increase in gross profit as percentages of net revenue were primarily attributable to the success of our product cost reduction and value engineering initiatives during which significantly reduced our costs for both our series products that we sell to hp and other customers as well as the products we sell to netapp 
another factor that contributed to the reduction in cost of goods sold was the million decrease in net revenue 
additionally  gross profit was positively impacted by million as a result of the recognition of revenue and costs of goods sold associated with the completion of a long term contract accounted for under the completed contract method 
also contributing to the decrease in cost of goods sold and increase in gross profit were lower manufacturing variances and overhead  which declined by million in compared to this decrease was due to a reduction in payroll related costs and efficiencies gained in our manufacturing and supply chain activities  offset by a million inventory reserve charge primarily associated with oracle end of life inventory and to a lesser degree certain excess component parts of our series products 
in addition  depreciation and amortization declined in by million due to the fourth quarter impairment and write off of certain long lived assets  as well as an intangible asset fully amortizing in the third quarter of partially offsetting the increase in gross profit was a decrease in net revenue from our higher margin products sold to sannet ii customers  primarily oracle 
research and development expenses of net revenue of net revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages research and development expenses the majority of the decrease in research and development expense in compared to was primarily the result of a decrease in project materials  tooling  outside testing  test equipment and non recurring engineering of million in the aggregate 
we incurred a significant amount of development costs associated with the ramp up of the hp product line in this development activity resulted in significant project materials  tooling  outside testing  test equipment and non recurring engineering 
these costs were not incurred 
table of contents to the same degree in in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we determined it probable that the amount of contingent consideration due to ciprico would be considerably lower than initially expected based on lower actual and projected sales of products eligible for the contingent consideration through the end of the contingent consideration period 
accordingly  we reduced the contingent consideration liability and research and development expense in the statement of operations to reflect the million reduction in estimated contingent consideration liability 
we also experienced a reduction in depreciation of million and a decrease in allocated common costs of million 
the reduction in allocated common costs was a direct result of our restructuring activities  as well as our long lived asset impairment charge  which resulted in lower facility costs and depreciation expense during the twelve months ended december  the remainder of the decline in costs of million related to declines in routine costs related to research and development activities  none of which were individually significant 
these decreases were partially offset by higher salaries and other payroll related expenses of million in the aggregate  an increase in intangible asset amortization of million and growth in consultant expenses of million 
the increase in salaries and other payroll related expenses was a direct result of hiring engineers to support hp as well as other development projects related to our strategic initiatives 
additionally  we hired new employees to support development activities related to the september acquisition of assets from ciprico 
the increase in intangible amortization is due to the amortization of certain intangible assets acquired from ciprico  which were only outstanding for a portion of the prior year 
the increase in consultant expenses are directly related to our ongoing development activities

payroll related costs declined as a result of a reduction in headcount 
the reduction in allocated common costs was a direct result of our restructuring activities  as well as our long lived asset impairment charge  which resulted in lower facility costs and depreciation expense in building rent was lower as a direct result of closing our netherlands office during the first quarter of these decreases were offset by increases in board of director fees of million and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange fluctuation of million

the increase in restructuring charges incurred is primarily the result of additional contract termination costs as we exited an additional portion of our carlsbad facility in for the year ended december   we incurred severance and related costs of million for various california employees whose positions have been relocated to colorado 
as part of the plan  we also incurred contract termination costs of million for the year ended december  primarily for facility lease and other associated costs that we continued to incur without economic benefit and due to revisions to our assumptions regarding the timing and amount of tenant sublease income 
for the year ended december   we incurred severance of million and facility costs of million related to our plan 
legal settlement of net revenue of net revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages legal settlement we received legal settlement proceeds in from two cases 
the proceeds from the first legal settlement of million reflects a claim we filed in february for arbitration in denver  colorado alleging that the representative of the chaparral shareholders was wrongfully withholding escrow funds due to us as a result of damages incurred by us relating to a completed patent infringement lawsuit filed by crossroads 
the proceeds from the second legal settlement of million reflects a claim we filed in december against infortrend for breach of the settlement agreement with crossroads whereby infortrend withheld approximately million for taiwanese taxes 
such amounts are reported as a reduction in operating expenses for goodwill and long lived asset impairment charge of net revenue of net revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages long lived asset impairment charge long lived asset impairment charges totaled million for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  at december   we identified a change in circumstances that 
table of contents indicated the carrying amount of certain of our long lived assets may not be recoverable due to the significant economic downturn at that time and resulting decrease in our market capitalization 
as a result  we incurred an impairment charge of million  consisting of million of property and equipment and million related to our licensed patent portfolio  which represents the difference between the carrying value and our estimate of the fair value of those assets 
we did not incur any long lived asset impairment charges in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more details 
other income of net revenue of net revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages other income  net other income  net decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in other income  net is primarily attributable to a decrease in interest income of million

the provision for income taxes available primarily represents state  local and foreign income taxes  partially offset by federal tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources the primary drivers affecting cash and liquidity are net losses  working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
historically  the payment terms we have had to offer our customers have been relatively similar to the terms received from our creditors and suppliers 
we typically bill customers on an open account basis subject to our standard credit quality and payment terms ranging between net and net days 
if our net revenue increases  it is likely that our accounts receivable balance will also increase 
our accounts receivable could further increase if customers  in particular large oem customers  delay their payments or if we grant them extended payment terms 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital compared to million of cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital as of december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents is further described below 
cash equivalents include highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of days or less and consist principally of money market funds 
in addition  we had million in short term debt and million in long term debt at december   consisting of a note payable issued in connection with the acquisition of certain intangible assets from ciprico 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million of cash provided by operations for the year ended december  the operating activities that affected cash consisted primarily of a net loss  which totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in our net loss was primarily attributable to an increase in our net revenue and gross profit due to higher sales to hp  lower manufacturing 
table of contents variances and excess inventory charges 
partially offsetting the increase in net revenue and gross profit were higher operating expenses as a result of the additional costs associated with the acquired cloverleaf business  investments in our channel program and lower interest income due to lower interest rates and cash balances 
the adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  that did not affect cash consisted of depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation expense of million  and a net gain associated with an adjustment to our contingent consideration liability to ciprico of million 
cash flows from operations reflects the negative impact of million related to an increase in accounts receivable  which was primarily due to an increase in net revenue during the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  as well as the timing of shipments within the quarter 
cash collection efforts remained strong  as our days sales outstanding approximated days for both the three months ended december  and december  cash flows from operations also reflects the negative impact of million related to an overall increase in inventories at december   as we had contractual purchase obligations for certain components with some of our contract manufacturing partners and we also built inventory related to the products we acquired from cloverleaf and for service inventory requirements 
additional uses of cash flows from operations include million related to a decrease in accrued compensation and other expenses  which were the result of the payment of million of accrued cloverleaf liabilities assumed in the business combination  partially offset by an increase in our accrued vacation liability of million and an increase in accrued salaries and salary related expenses due to timing 
in addition  we used million of cash from operations for long term liabilities resulting from million of deferred rent amortization  million of amortization related to customer prepayments and the reclassification of liabilities from non current to current 
cash flows from operations include sources of cash of million related to a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets due to the timing of other receivables from our contract manufacturing partners for component parts we buy and ship to them and also due to the timing of payments for various miscellaneous receivables 
in addition  cash flows from operations include sources of cash of million related to an increase in accounts payable due to the timing of payments to our vendors as our days payable outstanding increased from days for the three months ended december  to days for the three months ended december  cash flows from operations also include sources of cash of million related to an increase in deferred revenue as we received up front payments for engineering services and maintenance contracts  net of amortization 
investing activities cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million compared to million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was due to the acquisition of cloverleaf  net of cash acquired  of million and purchases of approximately million of additional property and equipment primarily associated with engineering laboratory expansion and equipment as well as additional equipment for our newly acquired cloverleaf business 
financing activities cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  is attributable to a million payment related to a cloverleaf loan obligation  million of tax liability payments associated with employee equity awards and million for the ongoing pay down of our note payable associated with our acquisition of certain intangible assets from ciprico 
this was partially offset by cash received from the sale of stock to employees under our employee stock plans of million 
although we did not have any amounts outstanding against our credit facility as of december   we borrowed million during  all of which was repaid in the same year 

table of contents based on current macro economic conditions and conditions in the state of the data storage systems markets  our own organizational structure and our current outlook for  we presently expect our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations  working capital and capital requirements for at least the next months 
cloverleaf s historical expenses have exceeded their net revenue  which is a trend we expect to continue in for example  cloverleaf generated net revenue of million and incurred a net loss of million in in addition  post acquisition  the cloverleaf business generated net revenue of million and incurred a net loss of million during the year ended december  as a result  while we expect the losses to decrease  we believe that the acquisition of cloverleaf will continue to be dilutive to our results of operations and also result in a net cash outflow for as we continue to invest in product development and sales and marketing activities 
the amount of cash needed to support the business we acquired from cloverleaf in will depend primarily on new customer installations  the timing of capital expenditures  product development costs and additional headcount needed to support customer requirements and improving the existing infrastructure of cloverleaf s operations 
we expect the amount of cash required to support the business we acquired from cloverleaf will decrease in compared to primarily as a result of expected increases in net revenue from the newly acquired cloverleaf technology platform 
our standard warranty provides that if our systems do not function to published specifications  we will repair or replace the defective component or system without charge generally for a period of approximately three years 
we generally extend to our customers the warranties provided to us by our suppliers and  accordingly  the majority of our warranty obligations to customers are intended to be covered by corresponding supplier warranties 
there can be no assurance that our suppliers will continue to provide such warranties to us in the future or that our warranty obligations to our customers will be covered by corresponding warranties from our suppliers  the absence of which could have a potentially significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
in and  we experienced quality issues associated with certain power supply devices provided by one of our component suppliers that required us to make substantial repairs and provide replacement parts 
our component supplier has agreed to reimburse us for the significant majority of costs of the replacement parts and related expenses 
although our component supplier has reimbursed us or committed to reimburse us for the significant majority of all of our costs incurred through december   there could be significant additional costs passed onto us by our customers 
to the extent that our customers provide us with claims for reimbursement for product quality issues caused by this component supplier  we believe that our component supplier is contractually obligated to reimburse us for any such costs 
an estimate as to the possible amount of claims or range of claims that our customers may present to us related to these product quality issues cannot be made as of december  to the extent that our component supplier cannot or does not continue to reimburse us for the significant majority of all expenses incurred by us or our customers we could incur material amounts of warranty claims and expenses 
the actual amount and timing of working capital and capital expenditures that we may incur in future periods may vary significantly and will depend upon numerous factors  including the timing and extent of net revenue and expenditures from our core business and strategic investments  the ability to maintain payment terms with our suppliers consistent with the credit terms of our customers  the overall level of net profits or losses  our ability to manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers  the potential growth or decline in inventory to support our customers  costs associated with product quality issues and the recovery  if any  of such costs by a supplier  the status of our relationships with key customers  partners and suppliers  the timing and extent of the introduction of new products and services  growth in operations and the economic environment 
we maintain a credit facility with silicon valley bank for cash advances and letters of credit of up to an aggregate of million based upon an advance rate of of eligible accounts receivable 
in february  we amended our credit agreement with silicon valley bank 
the amendment extends the maturity date to 
table of contents july   revises the definition of eligible accounts receivable to be less restrictive and also revises the definition of net worth to add stock based compensation expense  goodwill and long lived asset impairment charges  subject to certain limitations 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the prime rate and are secured by substantially all of our accounts receivable  deposit and securities accounts 
the agreement provides for a negative pledge on our inventory and intellectual property  subject to certain exceptions  and contains usual and customary covenants for an arrangement of its type  including an obligation that we maintain at all times a net worth  as defined in the agreement  of million subject to certain increases 
the agreement also includes provisions to increase the financing facility by million subject to our meeting certain requirements  including million in borrowing base for the immediately preceding days  and silicon valley bank locating a lender willing to finance the additional facility 
in addition  if our cash and cash equivalents net of the total amount outstanding under the credit facility fall below million measured on a rolling three month basis  the interest rate will increase to prime plus and additional restrictions will apply 
our credit facility also provides for a cash management services sublimit under the revolving credit line of up to  as of december  we had an outstanding letter of credit issued to our contract manufacturer in china in the amount of million 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under the silicon valley bank line of credit 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands 
contractual obligations total thereafter operating lease obligations inventory related purchase obligations other purchase obligations note payable total we lease office space  equipment and automobiles under non cancelable operating leases  which expire at various dates through june for purposes of the table above  the operating lease obligations exclude common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance expenses 
inventory related purchase obligations represent contractual purchase commitments to our suppliers for certain components in order to ensure supply of select key components at the most favorable pricing 
other purchase obligations represent purchase commitments made in the ordinary course of business 
in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with fasb interpretation  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance variable interest  or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we did not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have relationships and transactions with persons and entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties except as disclosed herein 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu the new 
table of contents standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable based on the relative selling price 
the selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  if available  third party evidence  or tpe  if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price  or esp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
concurrently to issuing asu  the fasb also issued asu no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  or asu asu excludes software that is contained on a tangible product from the scope of software revenue guidance if the software is essential to the tangible product s functionality 
we early adopted the provisions of asu and asu as of the beginning of fiscal for new and materially modified deals originating after january  the adoption of these provisions did not materially affect the results of operations for the year ended december  and would not have materially impacted previously reported results had the adoption been applied retrospectively  as revenue derived from software sales and multiple deliverable arrangements were not material 
the effect of adopting these standards on future financial periods will vary based on the nature and volume of new or materially modified revenue transactions in any given period 
in march  the fasb ratified a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force that recognizes the milestone method as an acceptable revenue recognition method for substantive milestones in research or development arrangements 
this consensus would require its provisions be met in order for an entity to recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a substantive milestone as revenue in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
in addition  this consensus would require disclosure of certain information with respect to arrangements that contain milestones 
this authoritative guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods on or after june  and was effective for dot hill in the third quarter of fiscal the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we place our cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions  investing primarily in money market accounts 
we have established guidelines relative to credit ratings  diversification and maturities that seek to maintain safety and liquidity 
our investment strategy generally results in lower yields on investments but reduces the risk to principal in the short term prior to these funds being invested in our business 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates can affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents 
a unfavorable change in the interest rate would not materially impact our december  balance sheet 
we have a line of credit agreement  which accrues interest on any outstanding balances at the prime rate 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under this line 
if we make borrowings under this line  we will be exposed to interest rate risk on such debt 
indicated changes in interest rates are based on hypothetical movements and are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur 
future earnings and losses will be affected by actual fluctuations in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar  the currency in which our consolidated financial statements are reported 
the most significant foreign currencies that subjected us to 
table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk for the year ended december  were the euro  british pound  japanese yen and the israeli new shekel 
correspondingly  our operating results could be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate volatility relative to the us dollar 
although we continue to evaluate strategies to mitigate risks related to the effect of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  we will likely continue to recognize gains or losses from international transactions and foreign currency changes 
although foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not historically been material  we incurred million in foreign currency transaction gains during the year ended december   primarily resulting from the remeasurement process of certain of our european subsidiaries that maintain their books of record in a currency other than the functional currency 
future changes in foreign currency rates could adversely impact our operating results 
a unfavorable change in exchange rates would result in foreign currency losses of approximately million
