item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section provides an analysis of the corporation s consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december  and the analysis should be read in conjunction with the related audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein 
cautionary note regarding forward looking statements this annual report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  which forward looking statements may be identified by the use of such words as believe  expect  anticipate  should  plan  estimate  and potential 
examples of forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  estimates with respect to the financial condition  results of operations and business of the corporation that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates 
these factors include changes in general economic and market conditions  legislative and regulatory conditions  or the development of an interest rate environment that adversely affects the corporation s interest rate spread or other income anticipated from operations and investments 
as used in this annual report  we  us and our refer to stewardship financial corporation and its consolidated subsidiary  atlantic stewardship bank  depending on the context 
introduction the corporation s primary business is the ownership and supervision of the bank and  through the bank  the corporation has been  and intends to continue to be  a community oriented financial institution offering a variety of financial services to meet the needs of the communities it serves 
the corporation currently has full service branches offices located in bergen  passaic and morris counties in new jersey 
the corporation conducts a general commercial and retail banking business encompassing a wide range of traditional deposit and lending functions along with the other customary banking services 
the corporation earns income and generates cash primarily through the deposit gathering activities of the branch network 
these deposits gathered from the general public are then utilize d to fund the corporation s lending and investing activities 
the corporation has developed a strong deposit base with good franchise value 
a mix of a variety of different deposit products  along with a strong focus on customer service  is used to attract customers and build depositor relationships 
challenges facing the corporation include our ability to continue to grow the branch deposit levels  provide adequate technology enhancements to achieve efficiencies  offer a competitive product line  and provide the highest level of customer service 
the corporation is affected by the overall economic conditions in northern new jersey  the interest rate and yield curve environment  and the overall national economy 
these factors are relevant because they will affect our ability to attract specific deposit products  our ability to invest in loan and investment products  and our ability to earn acceptable profits without incurring increased risks 
when evaluating the financial condition and operating performance of the corporation  management reviews historical trends  peer comparisons  asset and deposit concentrations  interest margin analysis  adequacy of loan loss reserve and loan quality performance  adequacy of capital under current positions as well as to support future expansion  adequacy of liquidity  and overall quality of earnings performance 
the branch network provides for solid coverage in both existing and new markets in key towns in the three counties in which we operate 
the corporation continually evaluates the need to further develop the infrastructure to enable the entity to continue to build franchise value  expand its customer base  and offer appropriate products and services to its existing and future customer base 
in and  the corporation  like all financial institutions  continued to experience a difficult and complicated economic and operating environment 
the corporation s results have been affected by the economic downturn through higher loan loss provisions and managing credit risk remains a significant challenge for the bank 
in addition  competition in the northern new jersey market remained intense and the challenges of operating throughout these years in a flat interest rate market continued to make it somewhat difficult to attract deposits at appropriate interest rate levels 
although the area in which the bank operates has been somewhat shielded by the national economic downturn  management continues to find it challenging to attract low cost core deposits 
furthermore  while the current economic 
table of contents conditions and softness in the real estate market have contributed to an increase in loan delinquencies  lending opportunities must be appropriately evaluated 
the corporation has not been involved in the subprime lending area 
in an effort to address the strong competition in attracting deposit balances  the corporation continues to evaluate product and services offerings 
in mid february we introduced our new power rate checking product 
this account pays a premium rate of interest and refunds atm fees charged by other financial institutions 
in return  the customer has simple monthly qualification factors such as enrolling in online banking with electronic statements and minimum levels of debit card usage 
this product contributed to the growth in deposits during and as well as increased fee income related to debit cards and reduced expenses related to statement rendition 
improvements and upgrades of our electronic online banking products and services continued to be a priority 
during we introduced an online banking cash management product as well as remote deposit capture services for businesses 
additional development and testing of technology included the introduction of mobile banking for consumers in during the corporation experienced an increase in mortgage loan refinance activity due to the corporation s promotion of a no cost closing program and the lower rate environment in the latter half of the year 
this activity allowed the corporation to sell a larger volume into the secondary market resulting in increased gains from the sale of mortgage loans 
in addition to a focus on increasing non interest income  there has been a renewed emphasis on expense control 
in  the corporation received million as part of the united states treasury department s troubled asset relief program tarp capital purchase program cpp 
in exchange  the corporation issued to the treasury  shares of series a preferred shares and a warrant to purchase  shares of the corporation s common stock 
the additional capital provided by the cpp solidified our already well capitalized position  thereby enhancing our ability to continue to grow assets and increasing our ability to make new loans 
accordingly  we can better serve the lending needs of consumers and businesses in our market 
despite facing economic and unprecedented challenges in  the corporation reported a net profit for the year 
the corporation will continue to concentrate its efforts on improving asset quality  growing and maturing its existing branch network  developing new products and services  capitalizing on technology and focusing on improved efficiencies during recent accounting pronouncements a discussion of recent pronouncements and their effect on the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements can be found in note of the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  as well as disclosures found elsewhere in this annual report on form k  are based upon the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the corporation to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contains a summary of the corporation s significant accounting policies 
management believes the corporation s policy with re spect to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments  which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
changes in these judgments  assumptions or estimates could materially impact results of operations 
this critical policy and its application are periodically reviewed with the audit committee and the board of directors 
the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance  including an assessment of known and inherent risks in the portfolio  giving consideration to the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  level of delinquencies  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured  the existence and estimated net realizable value of any underlying collateral and guarantees securing the loans  and current economic and market conditions 
although management uses the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate  which is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to make 
table of contents additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
furthermore  the majority of the corporation s loans are secured by real estate in the state of new jersey 
accordingly  the collectability of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the corporation s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in local market conditions and may be adversely affected should real estate values decline or the northern new jersey area experience an adverse economic changes 
future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond the corporation s control 
earnings summary the corporation reported net income of million  or diluted earnings per share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or diluted earnings per common share for the decrease in earnings during is primarily related to a higher provision for loan loss

net interest income is affected by the balances and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  changes in their corresponding yields and costs  and by the volume of interest earning assets funded by noninterest bearing deposits 
the corporation s principal interest earning assets are loans made to businesses and individuals and investment securities 
for the year ended december   net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  increased to million from million for the year ended december   reflecting an increase of  or 
the increase in the current year is primarily due to a decline in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest rate spread and net yield on interest earning assets for the year ended december  were and  respectively  compared to and for the year ended december  the net interest rate spread and net yield on interest earning assets for the current year reflect a decline in loan interest rates and yields on securities as well as a decline in the interest rates on deposits

for the year ended december   total interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased million  or  when compared to the prior year 
the decrease was due to a decrease in yields on interest earning assets partially offset by an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets 
the average rate earned on interest earning assets decreased basis points from for the year ended december  to in the current year 
the decline in the asset yield reflects the effect of a prolonged low interest rate environment as well as the impact of nonaccrual loans  including those transferred to nonaccrual during the current year 
average interest earning assets increased million in  or  over the amount with average loans increasing mi llion and investment securities increasing million 
interest expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december  to million 
the decrease was attributable to a decline in the average rate paid on deposits partially offset by an increase in average interest bearing liabilities 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased to for the year ended december  compared to during  reflecting a general decline in rates paid on deposits 
average interest bearing liabilities were million for the year ended december   reflecting an increase of million  or  when compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in average interest bearing liabilities is primarily attributable to the corporation s expanding customer base 
t he corporation continues to supplement its branch deposit network with a mix of wholesale repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank borrowings 
these alternative funding sources help to lower cost of funds and provide for better management of interest rate risk

table of contents the following table analyzes net interest income for the year ended december  over the year ended december  in terms of changes from the prior year in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in yields earned and rates paid on such assets and liabilities on a tax equivalent basis 
the table reflects the extent to which changes in the corporation s interest income and interest expense are attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior year rate and changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior year volume

on an ongoing basis  management analyzes the adequacy of this allowance by considering the nature and volume of the corporation s loan activity  financial condition of the borrower  fair market value of underlying collateral  and changes in general market conditions 
additions to the allowance for loan losses are charged to operations in the appropriate period 
actual loan losses  net of recoveries  serve to reduce the allowance 
the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates 
the loan loss provision of million for the year ended december  was significantly higher than the million loan loss provision recorded for the year ended december  the allowance for loan loss was million  or of total loans as of december  compared to million  or of total loans a year earlier 
the loan loss provision takes into account growth in the loan portfolio and an increase in nonperforming loans as well as the impact of chargeoffs 
in determining the level of the allowance for loan loss  the corporation also considered the types of loans as well as the overall seasoning of new loans to determine the risk that was inherent in the portfolio 
nonaccrual loans increased from million  or of total loans  at december  to million  or of total loans at december  during the year ended december   the corporation charged off loans totaling million compared to loans charged off of million in the prior year 
the allowance for loan losses 
table of contents related to the impaired loans decreased from million at december  to million at december  due  in part  to chargeoffs down to the net realizable value of collateral for some of the impaired loans 
in addition to these factors  the corporation evaluated the economic conditions and overall real estate climate in the primary business markets in which it operates when considering the overall risk of the lending portfolio 
the asset quality issues  caused by the national economic downturn which began in  and the current year chargeoffs and provision for loan losses are reflective of current economic conditions that contributed to an increase in loan delinquencies and the softness in the real estate market 
the corporation monitors its loan portfolio and intends to continue to provide for loan loss reserves based on its ongoing periodic review of the loan portfolio and general market conditions 
noninterest income noninterest income consists of all income other than interest income and is principally derived from service charges on deposits  gain on sales of mortgage loans  income derived from bank owned life insurance  merchant processing income and income derived from debit cards and atm usage 
noninterest income increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the prior year 
for the year ended december   noninterest income included million from gains on calls and sales of securities compared to  in gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled  for  an increase from  for the year ended december  due to an increase in mortgage activity in the current year reflective of lower mortgage rates and the corporation s promotion of a no cost closing program 
the increase in the activity for the current year resulted in an increase in the volume of loans sold and ultimately  an increase in gains on mortgages sold 
as previously reported  on december   the corporation s old its merchant servicing portfolio and  as a result  a decline of  in the related noninterest income line as well as a  decline in the related noninterest expense line is reflected for the year ended december  noninterest expense noninterest expense for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in noninterest expenses reflects the costs  such as legal and other collection related expenses  incurred in connection with the managing a higher level of nonperforming assets throughout the year 
as previously reported  on december   the corporation sold its merchant servicing portfolio and  as a result  a  decline in the related noninterest expense line as well as a decline of  in the related noninterest income line is reflected for the year ended december  the fdic insurance premium expense for the year ended december  includes the recording of an industry wide special assessment which amounted to  for the corporation 
in accordance with our by laws  which provide for tithing of ten percent of the corporation s pre tax profits to various charities  the corporation had charitable contributions totaling  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in income taxes for the year ended december   income taxes represented a benefit of  compared to a million income tax expense  for an effective tax rate of  for the year ended december  the tax benefit for the current year reflects a decrease in our overall projected effective tax rate as a result of our tax exempt income representing a larger percentage of pretax income due to lower earnings 
financial condition total assets at december  were million  an increase of million  or  over the million at december  this increase in assets reflects  among other things  an million increase in cash and cash equivalents  a million increase in securities  a million increase in mortgage loans held for sale partially offset by a million decrease in loan portfolio 

table of contents loan portfolio the corporation s loan portfolio at december   net of allowance for loan losses  totaled million  a decrease of million  or  over the million at december  residential real estate mortgages increased million 
although the corporation continued its policy of selling the majority of its residential real estate loans in the secondary market  certain loans were placed into portfolio 
of the loans sold  all have been sold with loan servicing released 
commercial real estate mortgage loans consisting of million  or of the total portfolio  represent the largest portion of the loan portfolio 
these loans reflected an increase of million from million  or of the total loan portfolio at december  commer cial loans decreased million to million  representing of the total loan portfolio 
consumer installment loans decreased million  partially attributable to borrowers consolidating secondary liens on their homes as they refinance in the lower interest rate environment 
the corporation s lending activities are concentrated in loans secured by real estate located in northern new jersey and therefore collectability of the loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in real estate market conditions in the northern new jersey market 
the corporation has not made loans to borrowers outside the united states 
at december   aside from the real estate concentration described above  there were no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans outstanding 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other related conditions 
the following table sets forth the classification of the corporation s loans by major category at the end of each of the last five years december  in thousands real estate mortgage residential commercial commercial loans consumer loans installment home equity other total gross loans less allowance for loan losses deferred loan fees net loans includes construction loans 
includes automobile  home improvement  second mortgages and unsecured loans 
the following table sets forth certain categories of gross loans as of december  by contractual maturity 
borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties 
this might cause actual maturities to differ from the contractual maturities summarized below 
within year after year but within years after years total in thousands real estate mortgage commercial consumer total gross loans 
table of contents the following table sets forth the dollar amount of all gross loans due one year or more after december   which have predetermined interest rates or floating or adjustable interest rates predetermined rates floating or adjustable rates total in thousands real estate mortgage commercial consumer asset quality the corporation s principal earning asset is its loan portfolio 
inherent in the lending function is the risk of deterioration in a borrower s ability to repay loans under existing loan agreements 
management realizes that because of this risk  reserves are maintained to absorb probable incurred loan losses 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management of the corporation considers the risks inherent in its loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of its loan activities  along with general economic and real estate market conditions 
although management attempts to establish a reserve sufficient to offset probable incurred losses in the portfolio  changes in economic conditions  regulatory policies and borrower s performance could require future changes to the allowance 
in establishing the allowance for loan losses  the corporation utilizes a two tier approach by identifying problem loans and allocating specific loss allowances on such loans and establishing a general valuation allowance on the remainder of its loan portfolio 
the corporation maintains a loan review system that allows for a periodic review of its loan portfolio and the early identification of potential problem loans 
such a system takes into consideration  among other things  delinquency status  size of loans  type of collateral and financial condition of the borrowers 
allocations of specific loan loss allowances are established for identified loans based on a review of such information and or appraisals of underlying collateral 
general loan loss allowances are based upon a combina tion of factors including  but not limited to  actual loss experience  composition of loan portfolio  current economic conditions and management s judgment 
the corporation s accounting policies are set forth in note to the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements 
the application of some of these policies requires significant management judgment and the utilization of estimates 
actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates resulting in a significant impact on the financial statements 
a critical accounting policy for the corporation is the policy utilized in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
although management uses the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short term c hange 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
furthermore  the corporation s lending activities are concentrated in loans secured by real estate located in northern new jersey 
accordingly  the collectability of a substantial portion of the corporation s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in real estate market conditions in northern new jersey 
future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory  and other conditions beyond the corporation s control 
in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses totaling million is adequate to cover probable incurred losses inherent in the portfolio at decemb er  nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  loans past due days or more and accruing  and other real estate owned ie  property acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure 
the corporation s loans are generally placed in a nonaccrual status when they become past due in excess of days as to payment of principal and interest or earlier if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful 
interest previously accrued on these loans and not yet paid is charged against income during the current period 
interest earned thereafter is only included in income to the extent that it is received in cash 
loans past due days or more and accruing represent those loans which are sufficiently collateralized and management believes all interest and principal owed will be collected 
restructured loans are loans that have been renegotiated to permit a borrower  who has incurred adverse 
table of contents financial circumstances  to continue to perform 
management can make concessions to the terms of the loan or reduce the contractual interest rates to below market rates in order for the borrower to continue to make payments 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding the corporation s nonperforming assets as of december of each of the preceding five years december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans construction residential real estate commercial real estate commercial consumer total nonaccrual loans loans past due days or more and accruing construction commercial real estate commercial consumer total loans past due ninety days or more and accruing restructured loans commercial real estate commercial consumer total restructured loans total nonperforming loans other real estate owed total nonperforming assets nonaccrual loans to total gross loans nonperforming loans to total gross loans nonperforming loans to total assets allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans restructured loans classified in the nonaccrual category totaled million    and  for the years ended december    and   respectively 
there were no restructured loans classified as nonaccrual for the year ended december  there were no restructured loans classified in the past due days or more and accruing for any years presented 
the nonaccrual loans are comprised of loans  primarily commercial real estate loans  commercial loans and construction loans 
while the corporation maintains strong underwriting requirements  the level of nonaccrual loans is reflective of the prolonged weakened economic conditions and the corresponding effects it has had on our commercial borrowers and the current real estate environment 
certain loans  including restructured loans  are current  but due to accounting guidance or cautious review  management has continued to keep these loans on nonaccrual 
the ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans increased to at december  f rom at december  a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the identification of nonaccrual loans reflects careful monitoring of the loan 
table of contents portfolio 
the corporation has been diligent and proactive in identifying and dealing with problem credits and is focused on resolving the nonperforming loans and mitigating future losses in the portfolio 
all delinquent loans continue to be reviewed by management on a biweekly basis 
as of december   the level of loans past due days was million 
we will continue to monitor delinquencies for early identification of new problem loans 
while not a significantly large portfolio  a large number of problem loans are commercial construction loans which have been affected by the struggling construction industry 
as such  the entire commercial construction portfolio is being actively monitored 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the known and inherent risks in the portfolio  consideration to the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  the level of delinquencies  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured  the existence and estimated net realizable value of any underlying collateral and guarantees securing the loans  and current economic and market conditions 
allocations of specific loan loss allowances are established for identified loans based on a review of various information including appraisals of underlying collateral 
appraisals are performed by independent licensed appraisers to determine the value of impaired  collateral dependent loans 
appraisals are periodically updated to ascertain any further decline in value 
general loan loss allowances are based upon a combination of factors including  but not limited to  actual loss experience  composition of loan portfolio  current economic conditions and management s judgment 
primarily as a result of the continuing higher level of nonperforming loans  the corporation recorded an increase in the provision for loan losses 
for the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was million compared to million for the year ended december  the total allowance for loan losses increased to of total loans from a comparable ratio of at december  when it is probable that some portion or all of a loan balance will not be collected  that amount is charged off as loss against the allowance for loan losses 
after net chargeoffs of million for the year ended december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million as of december  compared to million as of december  in general  the chargeoffs reflect partial writedowns on nonaccrual loans due to the initial evaluation of market values of the underlying real estate collateral in accordance with accounting standards codification asc approximately million of the charge offs related to a single loan 
while we have taken the conservative position of a full chargeoff on this loan  we continue to aggressively pursue collecti on  including legal action 
our allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans increased to at december   compared to at december  although nonperforming loans increased million  an increase in the allowance for loan losses resulted in the increase in this metric 
evaluation of nonperforming loans includes the updating of appraisals and specific evaluation of such loans to determine estimated cash flows from business and or collateral 
we have assessed these loans for collectability and considered  among other things  the borrower s ability to repay  the value of the underlying collateral  and other market conditions to ensure the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses 
the majority of our nonperforming loans are secured by real estate collate ral 
while our nonperforming loans have trended upward since december   the underlying collateral coverage for nonperforming loans supports the significant collection of our principal  and therefore  we do not estimate a proportionate upward trending in losses 
for the year ended december  net chargeoffs were million  of which approximately million was related to a loan to one borrower 
the ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans is reflective of detailed analysis and the probable incurred losses we have identified with these nonperforming loans 
as of december  there were million of other loans not included in the above table  compared to million at december   where credit conditions of borrowers caused management to have concerns about the possibility of the borrowers not complying with the present terms and conditions of repayment and which may result in disclosure of such loans at a future date 
these loans have been considered by management in conjunction with the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
for the year ended december   gross interest income which would have been recorded had the restructured and non accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to million  of which million was included in interest income for the year ended december

investment portfolio the corporation maintains an investment portfolio to enhance its yields and to provide a secondary source of liquidity 
the portfolio is comprised of us treasury securities  us government and agency obligations  mortgage backed securities  state and political subdivision obligations and other equity investments  and has been classified as held to maturity or available for sale 
investments in debt securities that the corporation has the positive intent and the ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity securities and reported at amortized cost 
all other securities are

the corporation s borrowings are a combination of advances from the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb ny  including overnight repricing lines of credit  and  to a lesser extent  securities sold under agreement to repurchase 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity interest rate movements have made managing the corporation s interest rate sensitivity increasingly important 
the corporation attempts to maintain stable net interest margins by generally matching the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing  or subject to repricing  by adjusting interest rates to market conditions  and by developing new products 
one method of measuring the corporation s exposure to changes in interest rates is the maturity and repricing gap analysis 
the difference or mismatch between the amount of assets and liabilities that mature or reprice in a given period is defined as the interest rate sensitivity gap 
a negative gap results when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a spe cified time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period of time 
conversely  a positive gap results when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing exceed the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing in the same given time frame 
the smaller the gap  the less the effect of the market volatility on net interest income 
during a period of rising interest rates  an institution with a negative gap position would not be in as favorable a position  as compared to an institution with a positive gap  to invest in higher yielding assets 
this may result in yields on its assets increasing at a slower rate than the increase in its costs of interest bearing liabilities than if it had a positive gap 
during a period of falling interest rates  an institution with a negative gap would experience a repricing of its assets at a slower rate than its interest bearing li abilities  which consequently may result in its net interest income growing at a faster rate than an institution with a positive gap position 

table of contents the following table sets forth estimated maturity repricing structure of the corporation s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  the amounts of assets or liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of each asset or liability and adjusted for prepayment assumptions where applicable 
the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the corporation s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities  for example  prepayments of loans and withdrawal of deposits  is beyond the corporation s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within a period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels

the corporation also uses a simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates 
the simulation model projects net interest income  net income  net interest margin  and capital to asset ratios based on various interest rate scenarios over a twelve month period 
the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of all rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
management incorporates into the model certain assumptions regarding prepayments of certain assets and liabilities 
assumptions have been built into the model for prepayments for assets and decay rates for nonmaturity deposits such as savings and interest bearing demand 
the model assumes an immediate rate shock to interest rates without management s ability to proactively change the mix of assets or liabilities 
based on the reports generated for december   an immediate interest rate increase of basis points would have resulted in a decrease in net interest income of  or million  and an immediate interest rate decrease of basis points would have resulted in a decrease in net interest income of or  management cannot provide any assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on the corporation s net interest income 

table of contents liquidity the corporation s primary sources of funds are deposits  amortization and prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities and funds provided by operations 
while scheduled loan and mortgage backed securities amortization and maturities of investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flow and prepayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
the corporation s liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents  is a product of its operating  investing and financing activities 
these activities are summarized below years ended december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents beginning operating activities net income adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents ending cash was generated by operating activities in each of the above periods 
the primary source of cash from operating activities during each period was net income 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
excess liquidity is generally invested in short term investments  such as federal funds sold 
the corporation enters into commitments to extend credit  such as letters of credit  which are not reflected in the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements 
the corporation has various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments 
the following table summarizes the corporation s contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payment due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations total contracted cost obligations other long term liabilities long term debt time deposits federal home loan bank advances subordinated debentures total other long term liabilities long term debt other commitments off balance sheet letter of credit commitments to extend credit unused lines of credit total off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 
table of contents management believes that a significant portion of the time deposits will remain with the corporation 
in addition  management does not believe that all of the unused lines of credit will be exercised 
we anticipate that the corporation will have sufficient funds available to meet its current contractual commitments 
should we need temporary funding  the corporation has the ability to borrow overnight with the fhlb ny 
in addition  the corporation had available overnight variable repricing lines of credit with other correspondent banks totaling million on an unsecured basis 
the corporation exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments 
the corporation uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
of the million commitments under standby and commercial letters of credit  million expires within one year 
should any letter of credit be drawn on  the interest rate charged on the resulting note would fluctuate with the corporation base rate 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the corporation evaluates each customer creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deem ed necessary by the corporation upon extension of credit  is based on management credit evaluation of the counter party 
collateral held varies  but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the corporation to guarantee payment or performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the corporation obtains collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary 
at december   the corporation had residential mortgage commitments to extend credit aggregating approximately million at fixed rates averaging 
approximately million of these loan commitments will be sold to investors upon closing 
commercial  construction  and home equity loan commitments of approximately million were extended with variable rates averaging and  were extended at fixed rates averaging 
generally  commitments were due to expire within approximately days 
the unused lines of credit consist of million relating to a home equity line of credit program and an unsecured line of credit program cash reserve  million relating to an unsecured overdraft protection program  and million relating to commercial and construction lines of credit 
amounts drawn on the unused lines of credit are predominantly assessed interest at rates which fluctuate with the base rate 
capital banks and bank holding companies are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
capital adequacy guidelines and  additionally for banks  prompt corrective action regulations  involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators 
failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action 
regulations of the board of governors of the frb require bank holding companies to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital 
under the regulations in effect at december   the corporation was required to maintain i a minimum leverage ratio of tier capital t o total adjusted assets of and ii minimum ratios of tier and total capital to risk weighted assets of and  respectively 
the bank must comply with substantially similar capital regulations promulgated by the fdic 

table of contents the following table summarizes the capital ratios for the corporation and the bank at december  actual required for capital adequacy purposes to be well capitalized under prompt corrective action leverage ratio corporation n a bank risk based capital tier i corporation n a bank total corporation n a bank the minimum leverage ratio set by the frb and the fdic is 
institutions  which are not top rated  will be expected to maintain a ratio of approximately to basis points above this ratio 
on january   the corporation received million in connection with its participation in the treasury s tarp cpp 
in exchange  the corporation issued  series a preferred shares and a warrant to purchase  of common shares 
the series a preferred shares pay a cumulative dividend of per annum for the first five years and per annum thereafter 
dividends are payable quarterly in arrears and the corporation accrues the preferred dividends as earned over the period the series a preferred shares are outstanding 
the warrant has an exercise price of per share 
the exercise price for the warrant was calculated based on the average of the closing prices of the corporation s common stock on the trading days ending on the last trading day prior to the date of the treasury s approval of the corporation s application under the program 
of the million of proceeds  million was initially allocated to the series a preferred shares and  was allocated to the warrant based on their estimated relative fair values as of january  the resulting discount on the series a preferred shares of  is being accreted through a charge to retained earnings over an estimated five year life of the stock offering using an effective yield method 
the series a preferred shares and warrant issued under the cpp are includable in tier i capital for regulatory capital 
the corporation may repay the funds provided under the cpp without regard to whether the corporation has replaced such funds from any other source or to any waiting period  subject to regulatory approval 
until the earlier of the third anniversary of the treasury s investment in the series a preferred shares or when all of the series a preferred shares have been redeemed by the corporation or transferred by the treasury to third parties  the corporation may not  without the consent of the treasury  increase the common stock cash dividend paid by the corporation
