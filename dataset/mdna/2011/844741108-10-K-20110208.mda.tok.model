table of contents note regarding use of non gaap financial measures the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these gaap financial statements include unrealized non cash adjustments and reclassifications  which can be significant  as a result of accounting requirements and elections made under accounting pronouncements relating to derivative instruments and hedging 
the company also provides financial information in this filing that was not prepared in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with gaap 
the company provides supplemental non gaap financial information  including results that it refers to as economic  which the company s management utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the company believes provides greater transparency to investors as supplemental information to its gaap results 
the company s economic financial results differ from gaap results in that they only include the actual cash settlements from fuel hedge contracts all reflected within fuel and oil expense in the period of settlement 
thus  fuel and oil expense on an economic basis reflects the company s actual net cash outlays for fuel during the applicable period  inclusive of settled fuel derivative contracts 
any net premium costs paid related to option contracts are reflected as a component of other gains losses  net  for both gaap and non gaap including economic purposes 
these economic results provide a better measure of the impact of the company s fuel hedges on its operating performance and liquidity since they exclude the unrealized  non cash adjustments and reclassifications that are recorded in gaap results in accordance with accounting guidance relating to derivative instruments  and they reflect all cash settlements related to fuel derivative contracts within fuel and oil expense 
this enables the company s management  as well as investors  to consistently assess the company s operating performance on a year over year or quarter over quarter basis after considering all efforts in place to manage fuel expense 
however  because these measures are not determined in accordance with gaap  such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner 
as a result  the aforementioned measures  as presented  may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
special items also include a charge of million and a charge of million each before the impact of profitsharing or taxes related to expenses associated with the company s planned acquisition of airtran and to freedom  the company s early out program  respectively 
management does not believe these expenses are a meaningful indicator of the company s results for those particular periods or in comparison to its performance in the corresponding prior or subsequent period 
as a result of the anticipated acquisition of airtran  which is expected to close during second quarter  the company expects to incur substantial charges associated with integration of the two companies 
while the company cannot predict the exact timing or amounts of such charges  it does expect to treat the charges as special items in its future presentation of non gaap results 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the planned acquisition of airtran and freedom  respectively 
further information on i the company s fuel hedging program  ii the requirements of accounting for derivative instruments  and iii the causes of hedge ineffectiveness and or mark to market gains or losses from derivative instruments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
year in review the year proved to be one of significant progress for the company in many respects 
for the th consecutive year  the company was profitable  earning million 
per share  diluted in  compared to the company s net profit of million 
per share  diluted 
on a non gaap basis  the company s net income was million  or 
per share  diluted  which was significantly better than the company s net income of million  or 
per share  diluted  on a non gaap basis 
see the previous note regarding the use of non gaap financial measures 
this considerable improvement in net income was achieved through better revenue management techniques and strategies  improving economic conditions which led to higher demand for air travel  capacity restraint and reallocation by both the company and the entire airline industry  fare increases  and targeted marketing campaigns designed to enhance the company s already strong 
table of contents brand and customer experience 
even though the company s jet fuel cost per gallon was percent higher than on an economic basis  a percent increase in operating revenues enabled it to overcome these higher prices and achieve a solid profit 
revenue management has been a focus area for the company for several years  and those efforts paid significant dividends during the company continued to optimize its flight schedule through the elimination of a number of unprofitable routes and re deployment of aircraft in either new markets or by adding additional frequencies in existing markets where demand is higher 
even with a very slight year over year capacity increase of less than one percent in  the company was able to add panama city  florida to its route map  as well as continue to grow such markets as denver and boston 
this continued flight optimization  along with new expected aircraft deliveries  will also provide the company the ability to commence service to three additional markets in the first quarter of greenville spartanburg  south carolina  charleston  south carolina  and the new york new jersey area through the acquisition of pairs of takeoff and landing slots at newark s liberty international airport 
another milestone for the company during was the launch of a marketing partnership with volaris  which is mexico s second largest airline 
as a result of this marketing partnership  the company s customers can now book international flights to five mexican destinations cancun  guadalajara  morelia  toluca mexico city  and zacatecas from southwest served cities through the company s new international connect product 
the company also completed all of the necessary testing and certifications for adding wifi connectivity to its aircraft fleet and began installation during the second half of as of january   wifi connectivity is available on more than aircraft and the company expects these installations to continue on its remaining fleet 
the company believes all of these accomplishments  along with initiatives introduced in the prior year  including new service offerings such as earlybird check in and pets are welcome on southwest paws products  are examples of opportunities for continued future revenue growth 
planning for the future has been an area of intense focus for the company in  as well 
during  the company announced it would be converting a portion of its future aircraft orders with boeing to aircraft 
all of the company s existing orders for aircraft deliveries from boeing in have been converted to s 
these aircraft offer approximately to percent more customer seating capacity than the company s existing fleet of s and s  which will enable it to more economically add service to longer range markets or to add seats to current markets without increasing the number of flights 
the company is also evaluating substituting s in lieu of firm orders currently scheduled for through the company has also made the decision to embark on a project that will result in the ultimate replacement of its reservations system over the next several years  and will launch its all new rapid rewards frequent flyer program on march  the company believes a new reservations system and the new frequent flyer program will create a platform for enhanced revenue growth over the long term 
under the new frequent flyer program  members will earn points for every dollar spent instead of credits for flight segments flown 
the amount of points earned will be based on the fare and fare class purchased  with higher fare products eg  business select earning more points than lower fare products eg  wanna get away 
each fare class will be associated with a points earning multiplier  and points for flights will be calculated by multiplying the fare for the flight by the fare class multiplier 
likewise  the amount of points required to be redeemed for a flight will be based on the fare and fare class purchased  however  unlike the current program  under the new program  i members will be able to redeem their points for every available seat  every day  on every flight  and with no blackout dates  and ii points will not expire so long as the rapid rewards member has points earning activity during a month time period 
in addition  rapid rewards credit cardmembers will be able to redeem their points for items other than travel on southwest airlines  such as international flights  cruises  hotel stays  rental cars  gift cards  event tickets  and more 
in addition to earning points for revenue flights  rapid rewards members will have the ability to purchase points 
the new frequent flyer program also features enhanced a list and companion pass programs for the most active members  and adds a new level of status  a list preferred 
both a list and a list preferred members will enjoy benefits such as priority checkin and security lane and ticket counter access  dedicated phone lines  
table of contents standby priority  and an earnings bonus on eligible revenue flights for a list and for a list preferred 
in addition  a list preferred members will enjoy free inflight wifi on equipped flights 
the new program has been designed to drive more revenue by i bringing in new customers both frequent flyers as well as new members for the company s co branded visa card  ii increasing business from existing customers  and iii strengthening the company s rapid rewards hotel  rental car  credit card  and retail partnerships 
the most significant strategic decision made by the company during  however  was its entry into an agreement to acquire airtran holdings  inc airtran 
subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement  which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both the company and airtran  if the merger is completed  each outstanding share of airtran common stock will be converted into the right to receive shares of southwest airlines co 
common stock and in cash  without interest 
the number of shares of southwest common stock and  under some circumstances  the cash consideration to be received is subject to adjustment based on the company s share price prior to closing 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the merger  the merger agreement  and the exchange ratio adjustment mechanism 
the company believes that  if approved  its proposed acquisition of airtran would position it to better respond to the economic and competitive challenges of the industry because it represents a unique opportunity to grow the company s presence in key markets it does not yet serve and would represent a significant step toward positioning the company for future growth  it would allow the company to offer more low fare destinations by extending its network and diversifying into new markets  including significant opportunities to and from atlanta  the busiest airport in the united states and the largest domestic market the company does not currently serve  it would allow the company to expand its presence in slot controlled markets where the company currently has little new york laguardia or no ronald reagan washington national airport service  it would allow the company to expand its service in other key domestic markets  including boston and baltimore and to add destinations to its route system  based on current operations  the addition of airtran would increase the company s share of current domestic market share capacity as measured by asms from approximately percent to percent  it would provide access to near international leisure markets in the caribbean and mexico  as well as smaller cities  and provide firsthand and meaningful insight into these new expansion opportunities  and based on current operations  it is expected that the combined company would serve more than million customers annually from more than different destinations in the united states and near international destinations 
the merger is subject to both government and airtran stockholder approval  with closing expected to occur in second quarter the company believes the transaction has the potential to yield net annual synergies of more than million by excluding one time acquisition and integration costs estimated to be approximately million  the transaction is also expected to be accretive to the company s fully diluted earnings per share in the first year following the close of the transaction  and strongly accretive  thereafter  upon full realization of the estimated net synergies 
in addition  the company and airtran are complementary  with little route overlap between the two carriers  and strategically  both carriers have an emphasis on outstanding customer service  high quality low cost operations  all boeing fleets  solid low fare brands  and strong employee cultures 
the company believes its bags fly free and no change fees campaigns  its new frequent flyer program  continued schedule optimization  and other revenue management efforts offer significant potential for continued 
table of contents revenue momentum 
however  higher fuel prices do present a threat to the company  and there are no assurances the company will be able to generate enough incremental revenues to offset higher fuel costs 
absent increased fuel price volatility or slowing of consumer travel demand  the company has a solid outlook for other than the company s growth opportunity presented by the airtran acquisition  the company currently does not intend to significantly grow its overall fleet size for the company anticipates it will receive deliveries during  of which are new aircraft from boeing  and is currently expecting to retire a similar number of its older s 
however  even with relatively little fleet growth  the company currently forecasts asms to increase approximately five to six percent compared to results of operations compared with the company s consolidated net income of million 
per share  diluted in represented an increase of million  or percent  compared to its net income of million 
per share  diluted 
the results in each year were significantly impacted by the company s fuel hedge program and the accounting requirements related to the derivative instruments used in the company s hedging activities 
as a result of the fuel hedges the company had in place during including those that settled during and those that will settle in future years the company recognized a net total of million in losses allocated between fuel and oil expense and other gains losses  net  in the consolidated statement of income 
during  the company recognized a total of million in losses as a result of its fuel hedging activities  allocated between fuel and oil expense and other gains losses  net

the majority of the increase in passenger revenues was attributable to the percent increase in passenger yield passenger revenues per rpm flown  primarily due to higher average fares 
the company s load factor also increased points to percent in  which was a record for the company 
these strong revenue results were achieved due to better revenue management techniques and strategies  improving economic conditions which led to higher demand for air travel versus  including a new and improved website at www

for january  the company estimated passenger unit revenues increased in the eight to nine percent range as compared to january consolidated freight revenues increased million  or percent  versus  primarily due to higher average rates charged as a result of better economic conditions versus the prior year 
the company currently expects freight revenues for first quarter to be in line with fourth quarter freight revenues

the remainder of the increase primarily was due to higher commissions earned from programs the company sponsors with certain business partners  such as the company sponsored chase visa card

the increase on a dollar basis primarily was due to higher owned aircraft depreciation expense  primarily due to a reduction in the estimated salvage values of owned aircraft that were recently retired or are expected to be retired during and  based on current and expected future market conditions for used aircraft 
this increase in expense was mostly offset by the execution of sale and leaseback 
table of contents agreements for previously owned s during the first half of the increase on a per asm basis primarily was due to the fact that the company s fleet size remained constant  while it reduced the number of asms flown as a result of economic conditions 
other operating expenses decreased million  but were up percent on a per asm basis  compared to approximately percent of the decrease on a dollar basis was due to lower bad debt expense related to revenues from credit card sales  and another percent of the decrease was due to lower personnel expenses  primarily due to the reduction in headcount  the company s decline in capacity versus  and other cost reduction efforts 
on a per asm basis  the increase in operating expenses per asm primarily was due to an increase in advertising expense compared to combined with the reduction in asms 
other other expenses income include interest expense  capitalized interest  interest income  and other gains and losses 
interest expense increased by million  or percent  primarily due to new debt issuances  including the company s december issuance of million of secured notes  its borrowing under its million term loan in may  and its july million borrowing under a term loan agreement 
these issuances were partially offset by declines in floating interest rates associated with the company s floating rate debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on long term debt transactions 
capitalized interest declined percent  or million  compared to  due to a reduction in progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries and lower interest rates 
interest income decreased million  or percent  primarily due to a decrease in average rates earned on invested cash and short term investment balances 
other gains losses  net  primarily includes amounts recorded as a result of the company s fuel hedging activities

the rate also includes the impact of slightly higher effective state income tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was billion in compared to million provided by operations in for the company  operating cash inflows primarily are derived from providing air 
table of contents transportation for customers 
the vast majority of tickets are purchased prior to the day on which travel is provided and  in some cases  several months before the anticipated travel date 
operating cash outflows primarily are related to the recurring expenses of operating the airline 
operating cash flows can also be significantly impacted by the company s fuel hedge positions and the significant fluctuation in fair value of those positions and the corresponding cash collateral requirements associated with those positions 
in the consolidated statement of cash flows  increases and or decreases to these cash deposits are reflected in operating cash flows as cash collateral received from provided to fuel derivative counterparties 
as of december   the net amount of cash provided to fuel hedge counterparties was million

off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  and contingent liabilities and commitments the company has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regard to future purchases of aircraft  payment of debt  and lease arrangements 
the company received boeing aircraft in  of which were new aircraft purchased from boeing and one of which was leased from a third party 
the company also brought back its four aircraft that had been removed from active service and put into storage during  and retired five older leased and owned aircraft from service during as of january   the company had firm orders with boeing for a total of aircraft and aircraft for the years through the firm orders for the aircraft are a result of the company s decision to substitute this aircraft type for s that had been previously ordered for the company also had purchase options for aircraft from through  with an additional purchase rights for aircraft through as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company also has the option to substitute s for the s ordered from boeing with at least months notice prior to the contractual delivery date  and can substitute s for the s with at least twelve months notice 
the leasing of aircraft including the sale and leaseback of aircraft effectively provides flexibility to the company as a source of financing 
although the company is responsible for all maintenance  insurance  and 
table of contents expense associated with operating leased aircraft  and retains the risk of loss for these aircraft  it has not made any guarantees to the lessors regarding the residual value or market value of the aircraft at the end of the lease terms

firm orders from boeing as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  a portion of the consideration to be paid by the company in connection with its planned acquisition of airtran will be in cash 
the company intends to fund up to million in cash consideration to airtran stockholders out of cash on hand upon closing of the acquisition  which is expected to occur during second quarter the company also expects to incur approximately million in integration and closing costs associated with the acquisition  a portion of which are expected to be in  and which are expected to be funded with cash 
the company believes that its current liquidity position  including cash and short term investments of billion as of december   anticipated future internally generated funds from operations  and its fully available  unsecured revolving credit facility of million  will enable it to fund the acquisition without adding significant further borrowings 
additionally  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and as set forth above in the contractual obligations table  the company has long term debt maturities of million in december and million in march the company will continue to consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize liquidity and supplement cash requirements as needed 
the company believes it has access to financing arrangements because of its current investment grade credit ratings  unencumbered assets  modest leverage  and consistent profitability  which should enable it to meet its ongoing capital  operating  and other liquidity requirements 
as of december   the book value of the company s unencumbered aircraft totaled approximately billion 
during  the city of dallas approved the love field modernization program lfmp  a project to reconstruct dallas love field airport with modern  convenient air travel facilities 
pursuant to a program development agreement pda with the city of dallas and the love field airport modernization corporation 
table of contents or lfamc  a texas non profit local government corporation established by the city to act on the city s behalf to facilitate the development of the lfmp  the company is managing this project 
major construction commenced during  with completion of the project scheduled for the second half of although subject to change  at the current time the project is expected to include the renovation of the airport airline terminals and complete replacement of gate facilities with a new gate facility  including infrastructure  systems and equipment  aircraft parking apron  fueling system  roadways and terminal curbside  baggage handling systems  passenger loading bridges and support systems  and other supporting infrastructure 
during fourth quarter  the lfamc issued million in tax exempt facility revenue bonds lfmp bonds  the proceeds of which have been or will be used to finance a significant portion of the ongoing costs of the lfmp  and to reimburse the company for approximately million in early lfmp expenditures made from april   through the date of issuance of the lfmp bonds such expenditures and reimbursement were authorized pursuant to a june  inducement resolution approved by the dallas city council and subsequent resolutions by the lfamc 
repayment of the lfmp bonds will be through the facilities payments described below 
reimbursement of the company for its payment of facilities payments are expected to be made through recurring ground rents  fees  and other revenues collected at the airport 
the company has guaranteed principal  premium  and interest on the issued bonds 
depending on funding needs and the timing of these funds from other sources  an additional tranche of bonds will likely be issued prior to the completion of the lfmp project 
it is currently expected that the total amount spent on the lfmp project will be approximately million 
prior to the issuance of the lfmp bonds by the lfamc  the company entered into two separate funding agreements a facilities agreement pursuant to which the company is obligated to make debt service payments on the principal and interest amounts associated with the lfmp bonds facilities payments  less other sources of funds the city of dallas may apply to the repayment of the lfmp bonds including but not limited to passenger facility charges collected from passengers originating from the airport  and a revenue credit agreement pursuant to which the city of dallas will reimburse the company for the facilities payments made by the company 
a majority of the monies transferred from the city of dallas to the company under the revenue credit agreement are expected to originate from a reimbursement account created in the use and lease agreement between the city of dallas and the company 
the use and lease agreement is a year agreement providing for  among other things  the company s lease of space at the airport from the city of dallas 
the remainder of such monies transferred from the city of dallas to the company under the revenue credit agreement is expected to originate from use and lease agreements with other airlines  various concession agreements  and other airport miscellaneous revenues 
the company s liquidity could be impacted by the lfmp to the extent there is not an additional future successful bond issuance  or there is a timing difference between the company s payment of the facilities payments pursuant to the facilities agreement and the transfer of monies back to the company pursuant to the revenue credit agreement  however  the company does not currently anticipate the occurrence of either of these items 
the lfmp is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s capital resources or financial position 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information and accounting requirements related to the lfmp 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
the company s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and 
table of contents changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
revenue recognition tickets sold for passenger air travel are initially deferred as air traffic liability 
passenger revenue is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided ie  when the flight takes place 
air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates 
the balance in air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity 
the company s air traffic liability balance at december   was billion  compared to billion as of december  the company estimates the amount of tickets that will expire unused and recognizes such amounts in passenger revenue once the scheduled flight date has passed 
estimating the amount of tickets that will expire unused  be refunded  or exchanged involves some level of subjectivity and judgment 
the majority of the company s tickets sold are nonrefundable  which is the primary source of unused tickets 
according to the company s contract of carriage  tickets whether refundable or nonrefundable that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight  up to a year from the date of sale  or can be refunded if the ticket is refundable 
a small percentage of tickets or partial tickets expire unused 
fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited 
estimates of tickets that will expire unused are based on historical experience over many years 
the company and other airlines have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from unused tickets at the date of travel 
holding other factors constant  a percent change in the company s estimate of the amount of tickets that will expire unused would have resulted in a million  or 
percent  change in passenger revenues recognized for events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical customer travel patterns can result in actual refunds  exchanges  or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates 
the company evaluates its estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts 
if actual refunds  exchanges  or forfeiture experience results in an amount outside of this range  estimates and assumptions are reviewed and adjustments to air traffic liability and to passenger revenue are recorded  as necessary 
additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and exchanges include  but may not be limited to  changes to the company s ticketing policies  the company s refund and exchange policy  the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares  promotional fare activity  and the impact of the economic environment on customer behavior 
the company s estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year  however  as with any estimates  actual refund  exchange  and forfeiture activity may vary from estimated amounts 
during  as a result of the company s efforts to stimulate demand through fare sales  passenger revenues consisted of a higher percentage of discount tickets flown and a lower percentage of fully refundable tickets flown 
consequently  the company s estimate of the amount of refunded  exchanged  or forfeited tickets recorded during was in a range of approximately to percent higher than what it believes its historical averages would indicate 
the company believes these estimates are supported by actual data and are reasonable given the underlying fact patterns 
during and  the company believes the amount of refunded  exchanged  or forfeited tickets recorded were closer to what historical trends would indicate 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for future refunds  exchanges  and forfeited tickets would be reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
accounting for long lived assets as of december   the company had approximately billion at cost of long lived assets  including billion at cost in flight equipment and related assets 
flight equipment primarily relates to the 
table of contents boeing aircraft in the company s fleet at december   which are either owned or on capital lease 
the remaining boeing aircraft in the company s fleet at december   are operated under operating leases 
in accounting for long lived assets  the company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and their future expected cash flows 
the following table shows a breakdown of the company s long lived asset groups along with information about estimated useful lives and residual values of these groups estimated useful life estimated residual value aircraft and engines to years aircraft parts fleet life ground property and equipment to years leasehold improvements asset life or lease term in estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft  the company primarily has relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types  current and projected future market information  and recommendations from boeing 
aircraft estimated useful lives are based on the number of cycles flown one take off and landing as well as the aircraft age 
the company has made a conversion of cycles into years based on both its historical and anticipated future utilization of the aircraft 
subsequent revisions to these estimates  which can be significant  could be caused by changes to the company s maintenance program  changes in utilization of the aircraft actual cycles during a given period of time  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and  when warranted  adjusts these estimates and assumptions 
generally  these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization expense  as required by gaap 
for example  during third quarter  the company changed the estimated residual values of its entire remaining fleet of owned and aircraft 
based on current and expected future market conditions related to these aircraft  the company reduced the residual values of these aircraft from approximately percent of original cost to approximately percent of original cost 
this determination was made due to the lack of buyers for these older aircraft  as many buyers of used aircraft prefer newer  more fuel efficient models  and the increase in the number of airlines retiring these older aircraft  which has effectively flooded the market 
as this reduction in residual value is considered a change in estimate  it has been accounted for on a prospective basis  and thus the company will record additional depreciation expense over the remainder of the useful lives for each aircraft 
the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment 
factors that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset s  a significant change in the long lived asset s physical condition  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset 
the company has continued to operate virtually all of its aircraft  generate positive cash flow  and produce operating profits 
consequently  the company has not identified any impairment related to its existing aircraft fleet 
the company will continue to monitor its long lived assets and the airline operating environment 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for expected lives  expected residual values  and impairment evaluations would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
financial derivative instruments the company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for more information on these 
table of contents risk management activities  and see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the company s fuel hedging program and financial derivative instruments 
all derivatives are required to be reflected at fair value and recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the company was a party to over financial derivative instruments  related to its fuel hedging program  for the years through the fair value of the company s fuel hedging financial derivative instruments recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december   not considering the impact of cash collateral deposits provided to counterparties  was a net asset of million  compared to a net liability of million at december  the change in fair value primarily was due to an increase in energy prices throughout most of  the expiration ie  settlement in which the company paid cash to counterparties of approximately million in fuel derivative instruments that related to  and the purchase of new derivative positions that will settle in future periods 
although the company s fuel derivative portfolio was in a net asset position at december   the positions that are expected to settle or expire during currently consist of a net liability of approximately million 
changes in the fair values of these instruments can vary dramatically based on changes in the underlying commodity prices  as has been evident in recent years 
for example  during  market spot prices for crude oil peaked at a high of over per barrel and hit a low price of under per barrel both within a period of approximately five months 
during  market spot prices ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel 
market price changes can be driven by factors such as supply and demand  inventory levels  weather events  refinery capacity  political agendas  value of the us dollar  and general economic conditions  among other items 
the financial derivative instruments utilized by the company primarily are a combination of collars  purchased call options  call spreads  and fixed price swap agreements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in over the counter markets 
since the majority of the company s financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange  the company estimates their fair values 
depending on the type of instrument  the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
also  since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel  the company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices 
forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices such as crude oil  heating oil  and unleaded gasoline and adjusted based on variations of those like commodities to the company s ultimate expected price to be paid for jet fuel at the specific locations in which the company hedges 
fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed  respectively 
however  once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed  all values and prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements 
in some historical periods  because of increased volatility in energy markets  the company has in fact lost hedge accounting for all unleaded gasoline derivative instruments 
at such times  the company has marked all such derivatives to fair value in each quarterly period  with all changes in value reflected as a component of other gains losses  net in the consolidated statement of income 
however  the company did not lose hedge accounting for any entire commodities during   or although commodities such as crude oil and heating oil have historically continued to qualify for hedge accounting in most cases  there have been instances in which the company has also lost hedge accounting in specific geographic locations for these commodities 
in these instances  the company has also marked such derivatives to fair value with changes reflected in the consolidated statement of income each reporting period 
although the company s prospective assessment has been utilized to ensure that the commodities used in most cases still qualify for hedge accounting in specific locations where the company hedges  there are no assurances that these commodities will continue to qualify in the future 
this is due to the fact that future price changes in these refined products may not be consistent with historical price changes 
increased volatility in these commodity markets for an extended period of time  especially if such 
table of contents volatility were to worsen  could cause the company to lose hedge accounting altogether for the commodities used in its fuel hedging program  which would create further volatility in the company s financial results 
estimating the fair value of these fuel derivative instruments and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in their fair values from period to period and thus determine their accounting treatment 
to the extent that the change in the estimated fair value of a fuel derivative instrument differs from the change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be purchased  both on a cumulative and a period to period basis  ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge can result 
this could result in the immediate recording of noncash charges or income  representing the change in the fair value of the derivative  even though the derivative instrument may not expire settle until a future period 
likewise  if a derivative contract ceases to qualify for hedge accounting  the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded every period to other gains and losses in the consolidated statement of income in the period of the change 
ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in other crude oil related commodities  especially given the recent volatility in the prices of refined products 
due to the volatility in markets for crude oil and related products  the company is unable to predict the amount of ineffectiveness each period  including the loss of hedge accounting  which could be determined on a derivative by derivative basis or in the aggregate for a specific commodity 
this may result  and has historically resulted  in increased volatility in the company s financial statements 
the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains and losses on the change in fair value of derivative contracts settling in future periods recorded during historical periods has been due to a number of factors 
these factors include the significant fluctuation in energy prices  the number of derivative positions the company holds  significant weather events that have affected refinery capacity and the production of refined products  and the volatility of the different types of products the company uses for mitigation of fuel price volatility 
the discontinuation of hedge accounting for specific hedges and for specific refined products  such as unleaded gasoline  can also be a result of these reasons 
depending on the level at which the company is hedged at any point in time  as the fair value of the company s hedge positions fluctuate in amount from period to period  there could be continued variability recorded in the consolidated statement of income  and furthermore  the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains or losses recorded in earnings may be material 
this is primarily because small differences in the correlation of crude oil related products could be leveraged over large dollar volumes 
the company continually looks for better and more accurate methodologies in forecasting expected future cash flows relating to its jet fuel hedging program 
these estimates are an important component used in the measurement of effectiveness for the company s fuel hedges 
the current methodology used by the company in forecasting forward jet fuel prices is primarily based on the idea that different types of commodities are statistically better predictors of forward jet fuel prices  depending on specific geographic locations in which the company hedges 
the company then adjusts for certain items  such as transportation costs  that are stated in fuel purchasing contracts with its vendors  in order to estimate the actual price paid for jet fuel associated with each hedge 
this methodology for estimating expected future cash flows ie  jet fuel prices has been consistently applied during   and  and has not changed for either assessing or measuring hedge ineffectiveness during these periods 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
fair value measurements the company utilizes unobservable level inputs in determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities 
at december   these included auction rate security investments  valued at million  a portion of its fuel derivative option contracts  which were a net asset of million  and million in other investments 

table of contents all of the company s auction rate security instruments are reflected at estimated fair value in the consolidated balance sheet 
in prior periods  due to the auction process which took place every days for most securities  quoted market prices were readily available  which would have qualified as level however  due to events in credit markets beginning during first quarter  the auctions for most of these instruments failed  and  therefore  the company has determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis or other type of valuation model  which qualify the instruments as level the company s analyses consider  among other items  the collateralization underlying the security investments  the expected future cash flows  including the final maturity  associated with the securities  and estimates of the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction or return to par value 
in association with this estimate of fair value  the company has recorded a temporary unrealized decline in fair value of million  with an offsetting entry to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
given the quality and backing of the company s auction rate securities held  the fact that the company has not yet recorded a loss on the sale of any of these instruments  and the fact that it has been able to periodically sell instruments in the auction process  it believes it can continue to account for the estimated reduction in fair value of its remaining securities as temporary 
these conclusions will also continue to be evaluated and challenged in subsequent periods 
the company currently believes that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues  because the underlying assets for the majority of securities are almost entirely backed by the us government 
in addition  these auction rate securities represented less than three percent of the company s total cash  cash equivalent  and investment balance at december   which the company believes allows it sufficient time for the auction rate securities to return to full value 
at the time of the first failed auctions during first quarter  the company held a total of million in auction rate securities 
since that time  the company has been able to sell million of these instruments at par value 
the company also remains in discussions with its remaining counterparties to determine whether mutually agreeable terms can be reached regarding the effective repurchase of its remaining securities 
the company determines the value of fuel derivative option contracts utilizing a standard option pricing model based on inputs that are either readily available in public markets  can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets  or are quoted by its counterparties 
in situations where the company obtains inputs via quotes from its counterparties  it verifies the reasonableness of these quotes via similar quotes from another counterparty as of each date for which financial statements are prepared 
the company has consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented and believes it has obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative contracts it holds 
due to the fact that certain inputs used in determining estimated fair value of its option contracts are considered unobservable primarily volatility  the company has categorized these option contracts as level as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  any changes in fair value of cash flow hedges that are considered to be effective  as defined  are offset within accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the period in which the expected cash flow impacts earnings 
any changes in the fair value of fuel derivatives that are ineffective  as defined  or that do not qualify for hedge accounting  are reflected in earnings within other gains losses  net  in the period of the change 
because the company has extensive historical experience in valuing the derivative instruments it holds  and such experience is continually evaluated against its counterparties each period when such instruments expire and are settled for cash  the company believes it is unlikely that an independent third party would value the company s derivative contracts at a significantly different amount than what is reflected in the company s financial statements 
in addition  the company also has bilateral credit provisions in some of its counterparty agreements  which provide for parties or the company to provide cash collateral when the fair value of fuel derivatives with a single party exceeds certain threshold levels 
since this cash collateral is based on the estimated fair value of the company s outstanding fuel derivative contracts  this provides further validation to the company s estimate of fair values 

table of contents frequent flyer accounting the company utilizes estimates in its recognition of liabilities associated with its frequent flyer program 
these estimates include the liability associated with frequent flyer awards that have been issued  are outstanding  and are expected to be redeemed at a future date  amounts associated with partially earned awards that are expected to turn into fully earned awards and be redeemed at a future date  and amounts associated with frequent flyer credits sold to companies participating in its rapid rewards frequent flyer program 
the company utilizes the incremental cost method of accounting for frequent flyer awards issued and for partially earned awards ie  flight credits earned in the company s rapid rewards frequent flyer program 
the term partial award refers to flight credits earned by customers for flights taken that in the aggregate are less than the amount needed to earn a frequent flyer award 
the company records a liability and reduction of passenger revenue for the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel as frequent flyer awards and partially earned awards are being earned 
the liability recorded by the company represents the total number of awards and partially earned awards expected to be redeemed by customers 
the estimated incremental cost of these liabilities include direct passenger costs such as fuel  food  and other operational costs  but does not include any contribution to overhead or profit 
prior to  the company did not record a liability for partially earned customer awards 
however  effective january   the company made a voluntary change in its accounting for frequent flyer benefits to begin accruing for partially earned frequent flyer awards 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information about this accounting change 
at december   the company had approximately million full or partial awards outstanding  of which approximately million were partially earned awards 
the company also sells frequent flyer credits and related services to companies participating in its frequent flyer program 
funds received from the sale of flight segment credits are accounted for under the residual method 
under this method  as of december   the company has estimated that approximately percent of the amount received per flight segment credit sold relates to free travel  and the remaining percent associated with items such as access to the company s frequent flyer program population for marketing solicitation purposes  use of the company s logo on co branded credit cards  and other trademarks  designs  images  etc 
of the company for use in marketing materials 
this apportionment of value between free travel and marketing services is estimated based on several factors  including fares  the habits of customers in redeeming awards for free travel  and the contractual rate paid by companies for the flight segment credits 
prior to  the amount estimated to be associated with free travel had historically ranged from percent to percent 
the estimated amounts associated with free travel are deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when the ultimate free travel awards are flown or the credits expire unused 
for the portion of funds received that is deemed not to be associated with future travel  the company has determined that the period earned is the period in which the company has fulfilled its obligation under the contract signed with the particular business partner  which is on a monthly or quarterly basis  upon sale  as the related marketing services are performed or provided 
the vast majority of these marketing services consist of the access granted  either monthly or quarterly  to various lists of the company s frequent flyer members 
the estimated amount that is not associated with free travel is recognized in other revenue in the period earned 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the assumptions used in estimating the liabilities associated with its frequent flyer program would be made based on the conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made

however  except for the aircraft that have lease payments that fluctuate based in part on changes in market interest rates  the remainder of the company s leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
commitments related to leases are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on the company s accounting for its hedging program and for further details on the company s financial derivative instruments 
hedging the company utilizes financial derivative instruments  on both a short term and a long term basis  as a form of insurance against the potential for significant increases in fuel prices 
the company believes there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases 
excluding the impact of the anticipated airtran acquisition  the company expects to consume approximately billion gallons of jet fuel in based on this usage  a change in jet fuel prices of just one cent per gallon would impact the company s fuel and oil expense by approximately million per year  excluding any impact of the company s derivative instruments 
as of december   the company held a net position of fuel derivative instruments that represented a hedge for a portion of its anticipated jet fuel purchases for each year from through see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the company may increase or decrease the size of its fuel hedge based on its expectation of future market prices  as well as its perceived exposure to cash collateral requirements contained in the agreements it has signed with various counterparties 
in  the company added to its fuel hedging position related to expected future fuel purchases 
the total net fair value of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the company s jet fuel market price risk at december   was a net asset of million 
this balance consists of the market value of fuel derivative instruments totaling a net asset of million  and is net of million in cash collateral that has been provided by the company to one counterparty and million in cash collateral held from another counterparty 
the fair values of the derivative instruments  depending on the type of instrument  were determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
an immediate percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the december  for all years from through prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by approximately million 
fluctuations in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects 
in addition  this does not consider changes in cash collateral provided to or by counterparties  which would fluctuate in an amount equal to or less than this amount  depending on the type of collateral arrangement in place with each counterparty 
this sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at december  levels  except underlying futures prices 
the company s credit exposure related to fuel derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a net positive fair value to the company 
at such times  these outstanding instruments expose the company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
as of december   the company had four counterparties in which the derivatives held were a net asset  totaling 
table of contents million 
to manage credit risk  the company selects and will periodically review counterparties based on credit ratings  limits its exposure to a single counterparty with collateral support agreements  and monitors the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty 
however  if one or more of these counterparties were in a liability position to the company and were unable to meet their obligations  any open derivative contracts with the counterparty could be subject to early termination  which could result in substantial losses for the company 
at december   the company had agreements with all of its counterparties containing early termination rights triggered by credit rating thresholds and or bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount based on the counterparty s credit rating 
the company also had agreements with counterparties in which cash deposits and or pledged aircraft are required to be posted whenever the net fair value of derivatives associated with those counterparties exceeds specific thresholds cash is either posted by the counterparty if the value of derivatives is an asset to the company  or is posted by the company if the value of derivatives is a liability to the company 
the following table provides the fair values of fuel derivatives  amounts posted as collateral  and applicable collateral posting threshold amounts as of december   at which such postings are triggered counterparty cp in millions a b c d e other total fair value of fuel derivatives cash collateral held by cp aircraft collateral pledged to cp if credit rating is investment grade  fair value of fuel derivative level at which cash is provided to cp to or to or cash is received from cp aircraft is pledged to cp to to n a n a n a if credit rating is non investment grade  fair value of fuel derivative level at which cash is provided to cp to or to or cash is received from cp aircraft is pledged to cp to to n a n a n a sum of counterparties with fair value of fuel derivatives m and no risk of the company posting collateral 
cash collateral is provided at percent of fair value of fuel derivative contracts 
thresholds may vary based on changes in credit ratings within investment grade 
at december   the million in cash collateral deposits held by the company has been netted against the noncurrent fuel derivative assets from that counterparty within other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the million in cash collateral deposits provided by the company to one counterparty has been netted against the noncurrent fuel derivative liabilities from that counterparty within other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
due to the terms of the company s current fuel hedging agreements with counterparties and the types of derivatives held  in the company s judgment  it does not have significant additional exposure to future cash collateral requirements 
as an example  if market prices for the commodities used in the company s fuel hedging activities were to decrease by percent from market prices as of december   given the company s fuel derivative portfolio  its aircraft collateral facilities  and its investment grade credit rating  it would have to provide an additional million in cash collateral to its current counterparties 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents during january  the company made the decision to forego its option under the agreement with one counterparty counterparty b in the above table to use some of its aircraft as collateral in lieu of cash and has provided additional cash to that counterparty to meet its collateral obligation based on the fair value of its outstanding fuel derivative instruments 
this decision  which can be changed at any time under the existing agreement with that counterparty  was made because the company has an adequate amount of cash on hand available to cover its total collateral requirement and has determined it would be less costly to provide the cash instead of aircraft  due to the nominal additional charges it must pay if aircraft are utilized as collateral 
the additional amount of cash provided as of january   was million 
the company also has agreements with each of its counterparties associated with its outstanding interest rate swap agreements in which cash collateral may be required based on the fair value of outstanding interest rate swaps  as well as the company s and its counterparty s credit ratings 
as of december   no cash collateral had been provided to or received from counterparties associated with the company s interest rate derivatives 
if the company s credit rating had been below investment grade as of december   it would have been required to provide million in cash collateral to one counterparty based on its outstanding net liability derivative position with that counterparty 
the outstanding interest rate net derivative positions with all other counterparties at december  were assets to the company 
due to the significance of the company s fuel hedging program and the emphasis that it places on utilizing fuel derivatives to reduce its fuel price risk  the company has created a system of governance and management oversight and has put in place a number of internal controls designed so that procedures are properly followed and accountability is present at the appropriate levels 
for example  the company has put in place controls designed to i create and maintain a comprehensive risk management policy  ii provide for proper authorization by the appropriate levels of management  iii provide for proper segregation of duties  iv maintain an appropriate level of knowledge regarding the execution of and the accounting for derivative instruments  and v have key performance indicators in place in order to adequately measure the performance of its hedging activities 
the company believes the governance structure that it has in place is adequate given the size and sophistication of its hedging program 
financial market risk the vast majority of the company s assets are aircraft  which are long lived 
the company s strategy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet and grow capacity steadily and profitably under the right conditions 
while the company uses financial leverage  it strives to maintain a strong balance sheet and has a bbb rating with fitch and standard poor s  and a baa credit rating with moody s as of december  the company s and french credit agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings were originally issued as floating rate debt 
in addition  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has converted certain of its long term debt to floating rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
as of december   this included the company s million senior unsecured notes due  the million senior unsecured notes due  the million senior unsecured notes due  the million senior unsecured debentures due  the million secured notes due  and the million senior unsecured notes due although there is interest rate risk associated with these floating rate borrowings  the risk for the and french credit agreements is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the company may prepay this debt under certain conditions 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the material terms of the company s short term and long term debt 

table of contents excluding the notes or debentures that have been converted to a floating rate as previously noted  the company had no fixed rate senior unsecured notes outstanding at december  the following table displays the characteristics of the company s secured fixed rate debt as of december  principal amount in millions effective fixed rate final maturity underlying collateral term loan agreement specified boeing aircraft term loan agreement specified boeing aircraft term loan agreement specified boeing aircraft the carrying value of the company s floating rate debt totaled billion  and this debt had a weighted average maturity of years at floating rates averaging percent for the twelve months ended december  in total  the company s fixed rate debt and floating rate debt represented percent and percent  respectively  of total noncurrent assets at december  in january  the company terminated the fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements related to its million senior unsecured notes due and its million senior unsecured notes due the effect of these terminations is basically that the interest associated with these debts prospectively revert back to their original fixed rates 
as a result of the gains realized on these transactions  which will be amortized over the remaining term of the corresponding notes  and based on projected interest rates at the date of termination  the company does not believe its future interest expense  based on projected future interest rates at the date of termination  associated with these notes will significantly differ from the expense it would have recorded had the notes remained at floating rates 
although there is no longer interest rate risk associated with these notes  the company will subsequently be exposed to the fair value risk over their remaining terms 
the company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash  which totaled billion  and short term investments  which totaled billion  at december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the company currently invests available cash in certificates of deposit  highly rated money market instruments  investment grade commercial paper  and other highly rated financial instruments  depending on market conditions and operating cash requirements 
as a result of turmoil in credit markets  the company has discontinued further investments in auction rate securities 
because of the short term nature of these investments  the returns earned parallel closely with short term floating interest rates 
the company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities 
a hypothetical percent change in market interest rates as of december   would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
a change in market interest rates could  however  have a corresponding effect on the company s earnings and cash flows associated with its floating rate debt  invested cash excluding cash collateral deposits held  if applicable  floating rate aircraft leases  and short term investments because of the floating rate nature of these items 
assuming floating market rates in effect as of december   were held constant throughout a month period  a hypothetical percent change in those rates would have an immaterial impact to the company s net earnings and cash flows 
utilizing these assumptions and considering the company s cash balance excluding the impact of cash collateral deposits held or provided to counterparties  if applicable  short term investments  and floating rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in rates would have a net negative effect on the company s earnings and cash flows  while a decrease in rates would have a net positive effect on the company s earnings and cash flows 
however  a percent change in market rates would not impact the company s earnings or cash flow associated with the company s publicly traded fixed rate debt 
the company is also subject to a financial covenant included in its revolving credit facility  and is subject to credit rating triggers related to its credit card transaction processing agreements  the pricing related to any funds 
table of contents drawn under its revolving credit facility  and some of its hedging counterparty agreements 
certain covenants include the maintenance of minimum credit ratings and or triggers that are based on changes in these ratings 
the company s revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring a minimum coverage ratio of adjusted pre tax income to fixed obligations  as defined 
as of december   the company was in compliance with this covenant and there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
however  if conditions change and the company fails to meet the minimum standards set forth in the revolving credit facility  there could be a reduction in the availability of cash under the facility  or an increase in the costs to keep the facility intact as written 
five of the company s hedging counterparty agreements contain ratings triggers in which cash collateral would be required to be posted with the counterparty if the company s credit rating falls below investment grade by two of the three major rating agencies  and if the company were in a net liability position with the counterparties including one counterparty in which the company had posted m as if december see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of december   there was no cash posted with any other counterparties 
the company was in a net fuel hedge liability position with one counterparty at december  in which no cash was posted 
assuming its credit rating were below investment grade as of that date  the company would have been required to post approximately million in cash collateral deposits with that counterparty 
the company currently has agreements with organizations that process credit card transactions arising from purchases of air travel tickets by its customers utilizing american express  discover and mastercard visa 
credit card processors have financial risk associated with tickets purchased for travel because  although the processor generally forwards the cash related to the purchase to the company soon after the purchase is completed  the air travel generally occurs after that time  and the processor would have liability if the company does not ultimately provide the air travel 
under these processing agreements  and based on specified conditions  increasing amounts of cash reserves could be required to be posted with the counterparty 
a majority of the company s sales transactions are processed by chase paymentech 
should chargebacks processed by chase paymentech reach a certain level  proceeds from advance ticket sales could be held back and used to establish a reserve account to cover such chargebacks and any other disputed charges that might occur 
additionally  cash reserves are required to be established if the company s credit rating falls to specified levels below investment grade 
cash reserve requirements are based on the company s public debt rating and a corresponding percentage of the company s air traffic liability 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all credit card processing agreements 
however  the inability to enter into credit card processing agreements would have a material adverse effect on the business of the company 
the company believes that it will be able to continue to renew its existing credit card processing agreements or will be able to enter into new credit card processing agreements with other processors in the future
