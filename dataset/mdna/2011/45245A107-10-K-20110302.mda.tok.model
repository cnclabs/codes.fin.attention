summary of contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in millions operating lease obligations purchase obligations litigation settlements other liabilities total the majority of the purchase obligations consist of day rolling estimates 
in most cases  we provide suppliers with a three to six month rolling forecast of our demand 
the forecasted amounts are generally not binding on us 
however  it may take up to days from the purchase order issuance to receipt  depending on supplier and inbound lead time 
timing of payments for the vast majority of other liabilities cannot be reasonably determined and  as such  have been included in the more than years category 
effective december   we began an agreement with a third party to outsource certain aspects of our information technology support 
while the agreement is cancelable at any time with certain cash penalties  our obligation through the expected termination date of january is included above 

table of contents the table above does not include payments for non contributory defined benefit pension plans 
it is our general practice  at a minimum  to fund amounts sufficient to meet the requirements set forth in applicable benefits laws and local tax laws 
from time to time  we contribute additional amounts  as we deem appropriate 
we expect to contribute approximately million to million to our pension plans in and have million recorded in other liabilities related to pension plans as of december  the table above does not include possible payments for uncertain tax positions 
our reserve for uncertain tax positions  including accrued interest and penalties  was million as of december  due to the nature of the underlying liabilities and the extended time often needed to resolve income tax uncertainties  we cannot make reliable estimates of the amount or timing of cash payments that may be required to settle these liabilities 
the acquisition agreements related to the tdk recording media  memcorp and xtrememac business acquisitions contained certain earn out provisions 
for the year ended december   no additional cash consideration was paid to tdk recording media  memcorp or xtrememac 
in addition  the earn out periods for the three business acquisitions ended during  accordingly  there are no future payment obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates to ensure they are consistent with historical experience and the various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could materially impact our results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements income tax accruals and valuation allowances 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected taxable income  statutory tax rates and tax credits allowed in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws require certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax returns  and some are temporary differences that will reverse over time 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized and establish a valuation allowance to the extent necessary 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions  and in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we record income taxes using the asset and liability approach 
under this approach  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered in the future 
a valuation allowance is recorded to the extent we conclude a deferred tax asset is not considered to be more likely than not to be realized 
we consider all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we determine we will not realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized significant restructuring charges related to our us operations 
due to these charges and cumulative losses incurred in recent years  we were no longer able to conclude that it was more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets would be fully realized 
therefore  during  we recorded a charge to 
table of contents establish a valuation allowance of million related to our us deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance charge is included in income tax provision on our consolidated statement of operations 
the accounting estimate for valuation allowances against deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events 
a valuation allowance established or revised as a result of our assessment is recorded through income tax provision benefit in our consolidated statements of operations 
changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events  or other factors  could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
at december   our net deferred tax asset was million 
these deferred tax assets are net of valuation allowance of million 
the valuation allowance relates to our us deferred tax assets not expected to be utilized in the future  and various worldwide operating loss carry forwards that we do not expect to realize 
our income tax returns are subject to review by various us and foreign taxing authorities 
as such  we record accruals for items that we believe may be challenged by these taxing authorities 
the threshold for recognizing the benefit of a tax return position in the financial statements is that the position must be more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than percent likely to be realized 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  was million  excluding accrued interest and penalties described below 
if the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in our consolidated financial statements  million would ultimately affect income tax expense and our related effective tax rate 
the other million of unrecognized tax benefit would reduce income tax expense  but would be offset by an increase in valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
interest and penalties recorded for uncertain tax positions are included in our income tax provision 
as of december   million of interest and penalties was accrued  excluding the tax benefit of deductible interest 
the reversal of accrued interest and penalties would affect income tax expense and our related effective tax rate 
our us federal income tax returns for through remain subject to examination by the internal revenue service 
the years through remain subject to examination by foreign tax jurisdictions  and state and city tax jurisdictions 
in the event that we have determined not to file tax returns with a particular state or city  all years remain subject to examination by the tax jurisdiction 
the ultimate outcome of tax matters may differ from our estimates and assumptions 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue may require the use of cash and could result in increased income tax expense 
favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense 
it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits could increase or decrease significantly during the next twelve months due to the resolution of certain us and international tax uncertainties  however it is not possible to estimate the potential change at this time 
litigation 
we record a liability when a loss from litigation is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
our current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on claims for which we can estimate the amount or range of loss 
based upon information presently available  we believe that accruals for these claims are adequate 
due to uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
while these matters could materially affect operating results in future periods depending on the final resolution  it is our opinion that after final disposition  any monetary liability to us beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   would not be material to our financial position 
as additional information becomes available  the potential liability related to pending litigation will be assessed and estimates will be revised as necessary 
intangibles 
we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including intangibles  at fair value 
intangible assets with a definite life are amortized based on a pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are consumed  typically with useful lives ranging from one to years 
the initial recognition of intangible assets  the determination of useful lives and subsequent impairment analyses require management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted 
table of contents cash flow analysis 
as of december   we had million of definite lived intangible assets subject to amortization 
while we believe that the current carrying value of these assets is not impaired  materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses 
goodwill 
we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill at fair value 
the initial recognition of goodwill and subsequent impairment analyses require management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis 
goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized 
during we realigned our corporate segments and reporting structure with how the business will be managed going forward 
as part of this reorganization  we combined our electronic products segment with our americas segment  and we separated our asia pacific segment into north asia and south asia regions 
our reporting units for goodwill are our operating segments with the exception of the americas segment which is further divided between the americas consumer and americas commercial reporting units as determined by sales channel 
as a result of the segment change  the goodwill of million which was previously allocated to the electronics products segment was merged into the americas consumer reporting unit 
the americas consumer reporting unit had a fair value that was significantly less than its carrying amount prior to the combination  which is a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test 
goodwill is considered impaired when its carrying amount exceeds its implied fair value 
a two step impairment test was performed to identify a potential impairment and measure an impairment loss to be recognized 
based on the goodwill test performed  we determined that the carrying amount of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its fair value and that the goodwill was fully impaired 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill was assigned to its carrying amount 
in calculating fair value  we used a weighting of the valuations calculated using the income approach and a market approach 
the summation of our reporting units fair values is compared and reconciled to our market capitalization as of the date of our impairment test 
based on the goodwill test performed  we determined that the carrying amount of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its fair value 
the indicated excess in carrying amount over fair value of the americas consumer reporting unit and goodwill is as follows excess of carrying percentage of reporting unit amount over carrying amount goodwill carrying amount fair value over fair value in millions americas consumer the second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 
this involves measuring the fair value of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities both recognized and unrecognized at the time of the impairment test 
the difference between the reporting unit s fair value and the fair values assigned to the reporting unit s individual assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
based on this step of the impairment test  we determined that the full amount of remaining goodwill  million  was impaired 
excess inventory and obsolescence 
we write down our inventory for excess  slow moving and obsolescence to the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional write downs may be required 
as of december   the excess inventory and obsolescence accrual was million 
rebates 
we maintain an accrual for customer rebates that totaled million as of december  included in other current liabilities 
this accrual requires a program by program estimation of outcomes based on a variety of factors including customer unit sell through volumes and end user redemption rates 
in the event that actual volumes and redemption rates differ from the estimates used in the accrual calculation  adjustments to the accrual  upward or downward  may be necessary 

table of contents restructuring reserves 
employee related severance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans 
generally  these charges are reflected in the quarter in which the board approves the associated actions  the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable 
in the event that the board approves the associated actions post the balance sheet date  but ultimately confirms the existence of a probable liability as of the balance sheet date  a reasonable estimate of these charges are recorded in the period in which the probable liability existed 
this estimate takes into account all information available as of the date the financial statements are issued 
severance amounts for which affected employees were required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the employees remaining service periods 
other accrued liabilities 
we also have other accrued liabilities  including uninsured claims and pensions 
these accruals are based on a variety of factors including past experience and various actuarial assumptions and  in many cases  require estimates of events not yet reported to us 
if future experience differs from these estimates  operating results in future periods would be impacted 
we sponsor defined benefit pension plans in both us and foreign entities 
expenses and liabilities for the pension plans are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on our assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  projected salary increases and mortality rates 
the annual measurement date for these assumptions is december see note to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosures of these assumptions for both the us and international plans 
the discount rate assumptions are tied to portfolios of long term high quality bonds and are  therefore  subject to annual fluctuations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate used in calculating the benefit obligation in the united states was percent at december   as compared with percent at december  a discount rate reduction of percent increases us pension plan expense pre tax by approximately million 
the expected return on assets assumptions on the investment portfolios for the pension plans are based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the respective portfolio 
because the rate of return is a long term assumption  it generally does not change each year 
we use historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with recent market conditions to estimate the future rate of return 
the rate of return used in calculating the us pension plan expense for  and was percent 
a reduction of percent for the expected return on plan assets assumption will increase united states net pension plan expense pre tax by million 
expected returns on asset assumptions for non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the united states plan 
the projected salary increase assumption is based on historic trends and comparisons to the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
in the united states  we have used the rate of percent for the past four years 
beginning in  the projected salary increase assumption is not applicable in the united states due to the elimination of benefit accruals as of january  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this change in benefits 
mortality assumptions were obtained from the irs static mortality table 
recently issued accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued additional disclosure requirements for assets and liabilities held at fair value 
specifically  the new guidance requires a gross presentation of activities within the level roll forward and adds a new requirement to disclose transfers in and out of level and measurements 
this guidance is applicable to all entities currently required to provide disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
the effective date for these disclosures is the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after december   except for the gross presentation of the level roll forward information  which is required for annual reporting periods beginning after december  and for interim reporting periods within those years 
the disclosures did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued additional guidance for entities with reporting units that have carrying amounts equal to zero or are negative 
these entities are required to assess whether it is more likely than not that the reporting 
table of contents units goodwill is impaired 
if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the goodwill of one or more of its reporting units is impaired  then step of the goodwill impairment test for those reporting unit s should be performed 
any resulting goodwill impairment should be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the period of adoption 
any goodwill impairments occurring after the initial adoption of the amendments should be included in earnings 
the effective date for this guidance is for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued additional and amended disclosure requirements for supplementary pro forma information related to business combinations 
the effective date for this guidance is prospective for business combinations in which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  while early adoption is permitted  no business acquisitions occurred during that would necessitate our adoption of this guidance during we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
a variety of proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards are currently under study by standard setting organizations and various regulatory agencies 
due to the tentative and preliminary nature of those proposed standards  management has not determined whether implementation of such proposed standards would be material to our consolidated financial statements

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk 
international operations  which comprised approximately percent of our revenue in  may be subject to various risks that are not present in domestic operations 
the additional risks include political and economic instability  terrorist activity  the possibility of expropriation  trade tariffs or embargoes  unfavorable tax laws  restrictions on royalties  dividends and currency remittances  requirements for governmental approvals for new ventures and local participation in operations such as local equity ownership and workers councils 
our foreign currency hedging policy attempts to manage some of the foreign currency risks over near term periods  however  we cannot ensure that these risk management activities will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates or that medium and longer term effects of exchange rates will not be significant 
although we attempt to utilize hedging to manage the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  our revenue or costs are adversely impacted when the us dollar sustains a strengthening position against currencies in which we sell products or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which we incur costs 
in accordance with established policies and procedures  we may utilize derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts  options  combination option strategies and swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging include the accuracy of our forecasts  the volatility of the currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and we are not a party to leveraged derivative transactions 
the utilization of derivatives and hedging activities is described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had million notional amount of foreign currency forward and option contracts of which million hedged recorded balance sheet exposures 
this compares to million notional amount of foreign currency forward and option contracts as of december   of which million hedged recorded balance sheet exposures 
an immediate adverse change of percent in year end foreign currency exchange rates with all other variables including interest rates held constant would reduce the fair value of foreign currency contracts outstanding as of december  by million 
we are exposed to credit risk associated with cash investments and foreign currency derivatives 
we do not believe that our cash investments and foreign currency derivatives present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the instruments consist of major financial institutions and we monitor and manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with each counterparty
