distributors and resellers earn volume incentive rebates primarily based upon the amount of product sales to end users 
we also offer rebates to end users who purchase products through various resale channels 
both volume incentive rebates and end user rebates are accrued as an offset to revenue 
research and development symantec embraces a global research and development r d strategy to drive organic innovation 
engineers and researchers throughout the company pursue advanced projects to translate r d into customer solutions by creating new technologies and integrating our unique set of technology assets 
symantec focuses on short  medium  and long term applied research  develops new products in emerging areas  participates in government funded research projects  drives industry standards and partners with universities to conduct research supporting symantec s strategy

customers in fiscal and one distributor  ingram micro  accounted for of our total net revenue in both periods 
our distributor arrangements with ingram micro consist of several non exclusive  independently negotiated agreements with its subsidiaries  each of which cover different countries or regions 
each of these agreements is separately negotiated and is independent of any other contract such as a master distribution agreement  and these agreements are not based on the same form of contract 
in fiscal one reseller  digital river  accounted for of our total net revenue 
in fiscal  we launched an internally developed ecommerce platform which has reduced our reliance on digital river 
acquisitions our acquisitions are designed to enhance the features and functionality of our existing products and extend our product leadership in core markets 
we consider time to market  synergies with existing products  and potential market share gains when evaluating the economics of acquisitions of technologies  product lines  or companies 
we may acquire and or dispose of other technologies  products and companies in the future 
during fiscal  we completed the following significant acquisitions company name company description date acquired verisign  inc identity and authentication business assets identity and authentication business assets purchase august  pgp corporation a nonpublic provider of email and data encryption software june  guardianedge technologies  inc a nonpublic provider of email and data encryption software june  for further discussion of our acquisitions  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
competition our markets are consolidating  highly competitive  and subject to rapid changes in technology 
we are focused on integration across the product portfolio and are including next generation technology capabilities into our solution set to differentiate ourselves from the competition 
we believe that the principal competitive factors necessary to be successful in our industry include time to market  price  reputation  financial stability  breadth of product offerings  customer support  brand recognition  and effective sales and marketing efforts 
in addition to the competition we face from direct competitors  we face indirect or potential competition from retailers  application providers  operating system providers  network equipment manufacturers  and other oems  who may provide various solutions and functions in their current and future products 
we also compete for access to retail distribution channels and for spending at the retail level and in corporate accounts 
in addition  we compete with other software companies  operating system providers  network equipment manufacturers and other oems to acquire technologies  products  or companies and to publish software developed by third parties 
we also compete with other software companies in our effort to place our products on the computer equipment sold to consumers and enterprises by oems 
the competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below 

table of contents consumer some of the channels in which our consumer products are offered are highly competitive 
our competitors are intensely focused on customer acquisition  which has led such competitors to offer their technology for free  engage in aggressive marketing  or enter into competitive partnerships 
our primary competitors in the consumer segment are mcafee  inc  mfe owned by intel corporation  and trend micro inc 
trend micro 
there are also several smaller regional security companies and freeware providers that we compete against primarily in the emea and apj regions 
for our consumer backup offerings  our primary competitors are carbonite  inc  and mozy  inc  owned by emc corporation emc 
security and compliance in the security and management markets  we compete against many companies that offer competing products to our solutions 
our primary competitors in the security and management market are landesk software  inc  mfe  microsoft corporation microsoft  and trend micro 
there are also several smaller regional security companies that we compete against primarily in the emea and apj regions 
in the authentication services market our primary competitors are rsa  the security division of emc  entrust  inc  comodo group  inc  and godaddy 
com  inc 
in the saas security market our primary competitors are google inc s postini services and microsoft 
storage and server management the markets for storage management and backup are intensely competitive 
our primary competitors are ca  inc  commvault systems  inc  emc  hewlett packard company hp  international business machines corporation ibm  microsoft and sun microsystems  inc  owned by oracle corporation 
services we believe that the principal competitive factors for our services segment include technical capability  customer responsiveness  and our ability to hire and retain talented and experienced services personnel 
our primary competitors in the managed services business are ibm  and secureworks  inc  owned by dell  inc 
intellectual property protective measures we regard some of the features of our internal operations  software  and documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  contractual arrangements  and other measures to protect our proprietary information 
our intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that enables us to gain recognition for our products  services  and technology and enhance our competitive position 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  distributors  and corporate partners  and we enter into license agreements with respect to our software  documentation  and other proprietary information 
these license agreements are generally non transferable and have a perpetual term 
we also educate our employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to protect our facilities  equipment  and networks 
trademarks  patents  copyrights  and licenses symantec and the symantec logo are trademarks or registered trademarks in the us and other countries 
in addition to symantec and the symantec logo  we have used  registered  and or applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products  technologies  and services from those of our competitors in the us and foreign countries and jurisdictions 
we enforce our trademark  service mark  and trade name rights in the us and abroad 
the duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country  and in the us we generally are able to maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use 

table of contents we have more than  us or foreign issued patents and pending patent applications  including patents and rights to patent applications acquired through strategic transactions  which relate to various aspects of our products and technology 
the duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and for the us is typically years from the date of issuance of the patent or years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent  which we believe is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 
our products are protected under us and international copyright laws and laws related to the protection of intellectual property and proprietary information 
we take measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary rights notices  and we actively enforce such rights in the us and abroad 
however  these measures may not provide sufficient protection  and our intellectual property rights may be challenged 
in addition  we license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products  and generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed intellectual property rights 
while we believe that our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success  we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent  trademark  license  or other intellectual property right 
seasonality as is typical for many large software companies  our business is seasonal 
software license and maintenance orders are generally higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our first and second fiscal quarters 
a significant decline in license and maintenance orders is typical in the first quarter of our fiscal year as compared to license and maintenance orders in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
in addition  we generally receive a higher volume of software license and maintenance orders in the last month of a quarter  with orders concentrated in the later part of that month 
we believe that this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns and budget cycles  as well as the impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel 
revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition criteria are met  and because a significant portion of our in period revenue is provided by the ratable recognition of our deferred revenue balance 
employees as of april   we employed more than  people worldwide  approximately percent of whom reside in the us approximately  employees work in sales and marketing   in research and development   in support and services  and  in management  manufacturing  and administration

item a 
risk factors a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below 
the list is not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 

table of contents fluctuations in demand for our products and services are driven by many factors  and a decrease in demand for our products could adversely affect our financial results 
we are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  competition  product obsolescence  technological change  shifts in buying patterns  financial difficulties and budget constraints of our current and potential customers  levels of broadband usage  awareness of security threats to it systems  and other factors 
while such factors may  in some periods  increase product sales  fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our product sales 
if demand for our products declines  our revenues and gross margin would likely be adversely affected 
if we are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread market acceptance  or if we are unable to continually improve the performance  features  and reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
our future success depends on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or introducing new products  product upgrades  and services on a timely basis 
we have in the past incurred  and will continue to incur  significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive 
new product development and introduction involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements  which has frequently been longer than we originally expected adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers extending the operation of our products and services to new and evolving platforms  operating systems and hardware products  such as mobile devices 
entering into new or unproven markets with which we have limited experience managing new product and service strategies  including integrating our various security and storage technologies  management solutions  customer service  and support into unified enterprise security and storage solutions addressing trade compliance issues affecting our ability to ship new or acquired products developing or expanding efficient sales channels obtaining sufficient licenses to technology and technical access from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to enable the development and deployment of interoperable products  including source code licenses for certain products with deep technical integration into operating systems if we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges  or if our new products  product upgrades  and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
we operate in a highly competitive environment  and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our products that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to decline 
we operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments  changes in industry standards  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product introductions and improvements 
if we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets  our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a drop in revenue that could adversely affect our business and operating results 
to compete successfully  we must maintain an innovative research and development effort to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services  effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors  appropriately respond to competitive strategies  and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information 
table of contents is accessed  used  and stored within our enterprise and consumer markets 
if we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands  we could experience a negative effect on our competitive position and our financial results 
our traditional competitors include independent software vendors that offer software products that directly compete with our product offerings 
in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to end users of our products  we compete with them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware oems and isps 
our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products with the products of our competitors or if these partners more actively promote our competitors products than our products 
in addition  software vendors who have bundled our products with theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or other vendors software or may limit our access to standard product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products for their platform 
we face growing competition from network equipment  computer hardware manufacturers  large operating system providers and other technology companies 
these firms are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection and storage and server management software that competes at some levels with our product offerings 
our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our products 
security protection is also offered by some of our competitors at prices lower than our prices or  in some cases is bundled for free 
some companies offer the lower priced or free security products within their computer hardware or software products that we believe are inferior to our products and saas offerings 
our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive these security products as replacing the need for more effective  full featured products and services such as those that we provide 
the expansion of these competitive trends could have a significant negative impact on our sales and financial results 
another growing industry trend is the saas business model  where software vendors develop and host their applications for use by customers over the internet or through the cloud 
this allows enterprises to obtain the benefits of commercially licensed  internally operated software without the associated complexity or high initial set up and operational costs 
advances in the saas business model could enable the growth of our competitors and could affect the success of our traditional software licensing models 
our inability to successfully develop and market new and existing saas offerings could cause us to lose business to competitors 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  sales  marketing  or other resources than we do and consequently may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours 
further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment  such as intel corporation s recently completed acquisition of mfe  could result in larger competitors that compete with us on several levels 
we also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete 
defects or disruptions in our saas offerings could reduce demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability 
our saas offerings may contain errors or defects that users identify after they begin using them that could result in unanticipated service interruptions  which could harm our reputation and our business 
since our customers use our saas offerings for mission critical protection from threats to electronic information  endpoint devices  and computer networks  any errors  defects  disruptions in service or other performance problems with our saas offerings could significantly harm our reputation and may damage our customers businesses 
if that occurs  customers could elect not to renew  or delay or withhold payment to us  we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us  which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts  an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

table of contents if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to their customers  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we sell our products to customers around the world through multi tiered sales and distribution networks 
sales through these different channels involve distinct risks  including the following direct sales 
a significant portion of our revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our direct sales force to end users 
special risks associated with direct sales include longer sales cycles associated with direct sales efforts difficulty in hiring  retaining  and motivating our direct sales force substantial amounts of training for sales representatives to become productive  including regular updates to cover new and revised products indirect sales channels 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels  including distributors that sell our products to end users and other resellers 
this channel involves a number of risks  including our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to end users our resellers and distributors are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers our reseller and distributor agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause our resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute competing products and may  from time to time  place greater emphasis on the sale of these products due to pricing  promotions  and other terms offered by our competitors recent consolidation of electronics retailers has increased their negotiating power with respect to hardware and software providers oem sales channels 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through our oem partners that incorporate our products into  or bundle our products with  their products 
our reliance on this sales channel involves many risks  including our lack of control over the volume of systems shipped and the timing of such shipments our oem partners are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers our oem partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements with us and new terms may be less favorable due to competitive conditions in our markets and other factors sales through our oem partners are subject to changes in general economic conditions  strategic direction  competitive risks  and other issues that could result in a reduction of oem sales the development work that we must generally undertake under our agreements with our oem partners may require us to invest significant resources and incur significant costs with little or no assurance of ever receiving associated revenues the time and expense required for the sales and marketing organizations of our oem partners to become familiar with our products may make it more difficult to introduce those products to the market our oem partners may develop  market  and distribute their own products and market and distribute products of our competitors  which could reduce our sales if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully  these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate  which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position 
some of our distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the 
table of contents past  and if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future because of general economic conditions or for other reasons  these partners may delay paying their obligations to us and we may have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense that could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability in demand  which could increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future  and could result in adverse operating results in future periods 
we have grown  and may continue to grow  through acquisitions  which gives rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect our future financial results 
we have in the past acquired  and we expect to acquire in the future  other businesses  business units  and technologies 
acquisitions can involve a number of special risks and challenges  including complexity  time  and costs associated with the integration of acquired business operations  workforce  products  and technologies diversion of management time and attention loss or termination of employees  including costs associated with the termination or replacement of those employees assumption of liabilities of the acquired business  including litigation related to the acquired business the addition of acquisition related debt as well as increased expenses and working capital requirements dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders substantial accounting charges for restructuring and related expenses  write off of in process research and development  impairment of goodwill  amortization of intangible assets  and stock based compensation expense if integration of our acquired businesses is not successful  we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects 
to integrate acquired businesses  we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations 
we also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests  and may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 
any of the foregoing  and other factors  could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions 
risks related to the provision of our saas offerings could impair our ability to deliver our services and could expose us to liability 
we currently serve our saas based customers from hosting facilities located across the globe 
any damage to  or failure of  any element of these hosting facilities could result in interruptions in our service  which could harm our customers and expose us to liability 
interruptions or failures in our service delivery could cause customers to terminate their subscriptions with us  could adversely affect our renewal rates  and could harm our ability to attract new customers 
our business would also be harmed if our customers believe that our saas offerings are unreliable 
as we continue to offer more of our software products in a saas based delivery model  all of these risks could be exacerbated 
our saas offerings also involve the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information  and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information  which could lead to litigation and possible liability 
despite our precautions to protect against such breaches  our security measures could be breached at any time and could result in unauthorized third parties obtaining access to our  or our customers data 
a security breach could also result in a loss of confidence in the security of our saas offerings  which could negatively impact our business 

table of contents our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liabilities 
as a result of the sale of our convertible senior notes notes and convertible senior notes notes  collectively referred to as the convertible senior notes in june  and senior notes notes and senior notes notes  collectively referred to as the senior notes in september  we have notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of billion that mature at specific dates in calendar years   and in addition  we have entered into a credit facility with a borrowing capacity of billion 
from time to time in the future  we may also incur indebtedness in addition to the amount available under our credit facility 
our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our flexibility to take advantage of certain corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
of our outstanding convertible senior notes  million matures and is repayable in june and billion is due in june we may be required to use all or a substantial portion of our cash balance to repay these notes on maturity unless we can obtain new financing 
adverse global economic events may harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
adverse macroeconomic conditions could negatively affect our business  operating results or financial condition under a number of different scenarios 
during challenging economic times and periods of high unemployment  current or potential customers may delay or forgo decisions to license new products or additional instances of existing products  upgrade their existing hardware or operating environments which upgrades are often a catalyst for new purchases of our software  or purchase services 
customers may also have difficulties in obtaining the requisite third party financing to complete the purchase of our products and services 
an adverse macroeconomic environment could also subject us to increased credit risk should customers be unable to pay us  or delay paying us  for previously purchased products and services 
accordingly  reserves for doubtful accounts and write offs of accounts receivable may increase 
in addition  weakness in the market for end users of our products could harm the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could then delay paying their obligations to us or experience other financial difficulties 
this would further increase our credit risk exposure and  potentially  cause delays in our recognition of revenue on sales to these customers 
in addition  the onset or continuation of adverse economic conditions may make it more difficult either to utilize our existing debt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for our operations  investing activities including potential acquisitions or financing activities 
specific economic trends  such as declines in the demand for pcs  servers  and other computing devices  or softness in corporate information technology spending  could have an even more direct  and harmful  impact on our business 
our international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses  adversely affect our operating results  and require increased time and attention of our management 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us  including engineering  sales  customer support  and production 
we plan to expand our international operations  but such expansion is contingent upon the financial performance of our existing international operations as well as our identification of growth opportunities 
our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations  including potential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws or that may not be adequately enforced requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls  including trade and labor restrictions and related laws that reduce the flexibility of our business operations regulations or restrictions on the use  import  or export of encryption technologies that could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices  including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti corruption laws and regulations 
table of contents central bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash in international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the us fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability such as higher interest rates in the us and inflationary conditions that could reduce our customers ability to obtain financing for software products or that could make our products more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countries limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest sufficiently in our international operations longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable difficulties in staffing  managing  and operating our international operations  including difficulties related to administering our stock plans in some foreign countries difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in europe and in other periods in other countries costs and delays associated with developing software and providing support in multiple languages political unrest  war  or terrorism  or regional natural disasters  particularly in areas in which we have facilities a significant portion of our transactions outside of the us are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our revenues and expenses will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
we expect to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future  especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales or our operations outside the united states continue to increase 
the level of corporate tax from sales to our non us customers is generally less than the level of tax from sales to our us customers 
this benefit is contingent upon existing tax regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located 
future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits 
our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of computer configurations  which could result in errors or product failures 
because we offer very complex products  undetected errors  failures  or bugs may occur  especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released 
our products are often installed and used in large scale computing environments with different operating systems  system management software  and equipment and networking configurations  which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors  failures  or bugs in our products 
our customers computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and non standard configurations that make pre release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time consuming 
in addition  despite testing by us and others  errors  failures  or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments 
in the past  we have discovered software errors  failures  and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and  in some cases  have experienced delayed or lost revenues as a result of these errors 
errors  failures  or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity  damage to our brand  product returns  loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  loss of competitive position  or claims by customers or others 
many of our end user customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other  less critical  software products 
in addition  if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity or availability occurs in one of our end user customer s systems  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products  the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed 
alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions  delays  or cessation of our 
table of contents product licensing  which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees  lose key personnel  fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully  or fail to manage our employee base effectively  we may be unable to develop new and enhanced products and services  effectively manage or expand our business  or increase our revenues 
our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain our key management  technical  sales  marketing  finance  and other critical personnel 
our officers and other key personnel are employees at will  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them 
competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant 
in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace  we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package  including cash and equity based compensation 
the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans  and accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of employee stock options and other forms of equity based compensation as compensation expense 
as a result  we may decide to issue fewer equity based incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel 
if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees  or conversely  if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
from time to time  key personnel leave our company 
while we strive to reduce the negative impact of such changes  the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations  including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases  the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives  the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting  and the results of our operations 
in addition  hiring  training  and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming  may cause additional disruptions to our operations  and may be unsuccessful  which could negatively impact future revenues 
from time to time we are a party to class action lawsuits  which often require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses  and which could  if not determined favorably  negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
we have been named as a party to class action lawsuits  and we may be named in additional litigation 
the expense of defending such litigation may be costly and divert management s attention from the day to day operations of our business  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could negatively impact our business  results of operations  and cash flows 
third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 
from time to time  we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others  including claims regarding patents  copyrights  and trademarks 
in addition  former employers of our former  current  or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers 
any such claim  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation and distract management from day to day operations 
if we are not successful in defending such claims  we could be required to stop selling  delay shipments of  or redesign our products  pay monetary amounts as damages  enter into royalty or licensing arrangements  or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers 
we cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in addition  we license and use software from third parties in our business 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all  and may expose us to additional liability 
this 
table of contents liability  or our inability to use any of this third party software  could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
if we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology  our financial results could be harmed 
most of our software and underlying technology is proprietary 
we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright  patent  trademark  and trade secret laws 
however  all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented by third parties 
third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain  use  distribute  and sell our proprietary information without authorization 
third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents 
our shrink wrap license agreements are not signed by licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions 
furthermore  the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the us  and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries 
the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products 
any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software  operating system  and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor  or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers 
in addition  any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in  alone or through our alliances with the business software alliance bsa  or the software information industry association siia  could be costly  may distract management from day to day operations  and may lead to additional claims against us  which could adversely affect our operating results 
some of our products contain open source software  and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 
certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under so called open source licenses  which may include  by way of example  the gnu general public license gpl  gnu lesser general public license lgpl  the mozilla public license  the bsd license  and the apache license 
some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software  and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use 
by the terms of certain open source licenses  we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner 
in addition to risks related to license requirements  usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software  as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software 
we have established processes to help alleviate these risks  including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source  but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products 
in addition  many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated  and could  if not properly addressed  negatively affect our business 
our software products and website may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales 
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions  we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance of our products and harm our reputation as a company 
similarly  experienced computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our website and misappropriate proprietary information and or cause interruptions of our services 
because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
the theft and or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position  reputation  brand and future sales of our products  and our customers may assert claims against us related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information 
our 
table of contents business could be subject to significant disruption  and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm  in the event of such incidents and claims 
increased customer demands on our technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results 
we offer technical support services with many of our products 
we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short term increases in customer demand for support services 
we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers 
further customer demand for these services  without corresponding revenues  could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results 
we have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide consumer support functions to third party service providers 
if these companies experience financial difficulties  do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts  or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts  the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted  which could materially harm our relationships with these customers 
accounting charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results 
our financial results have been in the past  and may continue to be in the future  materially affected by non cash and other accounting charges  including amortization of intangible assets  including acquired product rights impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets stock based compensation expense restructuring charges loss on sale of a business and similar write downs of assets held for sale for example  during fiscal  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of billion  resulting in a significant net loss for the year 
goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant as we determined they did in the third quarter of fiscal  and our evaluation depends to a large degree on estimates and assumptions made by our management 
our assessment of any impairment of goodwill is based on a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of that reporting unit 
our determination of fair value relies on management s assumptions of our future revenues  operating costs  and other relevant factors 
if management s estimates of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other key assumptions such as the discount rate applied to future operating results  the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units could change significantly  which could result in a goodwill impairment charge 
in addition  we evaluate our other long lived assets  including intangible assets whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that the value of these assets might be impaired 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  we could incur an impairment charge against the value of these assets 
the foregoing types of accounting charges may also be incurred in connection with or as a result of other business acquisitions 
the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by the foregoing accounting charges 
our effective tax rate may increase  which could increase our income tax expense and reduce increase our net income loss 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control  including changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates 
table of contents changing tax laws  regulations  and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods tax assessments  or any related tax interest or penalties  could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place the price of our common stock could decline if our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate 
we report our results of operations based on our determination of the aggregate amount of taxes owed in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
from time to time  we receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction has determined that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority 
we are regularly engaged in discussions and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities 
we are engaged in disputes of this nature at this time 
if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for  our operating results  cash flows  and financial condition could be adversely affected 
fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the price of our common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in the future 
our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and which could adversely affect our operations and operating results 
if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  our stock price could be negatively affected 
any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock 
our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance 
factors associated with our industry  the operation of our business  and the markets for our products may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate  including reduced demand for any of our products entry of new competition into our markets competitive pricing pressure for one or more of our classes of products our ability to timely complete the release of new or enhanced versions of our products fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the number  severity  and timing of threat outbreaks eg worms and viruses our resellers making a substantial portion of their purchases near the end of each quarter enterprise customers tendency to negotiate site licenses near the end of each quarter cancellation  deferral  or limitation of orders by customers movement in interest rates the rate of adoption of new product technologies and new releases of operating systems weakness or uncertainty in general economic or industry conditions in any of the multiple markets in which we operate that could reduce customer demand and ability to pay for our products and services political and military instability  which could slow spending within our target markets  delay sales cycles  and otherwise adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and operate effectively 
table of contents budgetary constraints of customers  which are influenced by corporate earnings and government budget cycles and spending objectives disruptions in our business operations or target markets caused by  among other things  earthquakes  floods  or other natural disasters affecting our headquarters located in silicon valley  california  an area known for seismic activity  or our other locations worldwide acts of war or terrorism intentional disruptions by third parties health or similar issues  such as a pandemic any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
our stock price may be volatile in the future  and you could lose the value of your investment 
the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future  and as a result you could lose the value of your investment 
the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including announcements of quarterly operating results and revenue and earnings forecasts by us that fail to meet or be consistent with our earlier projections or the expectations of our investors or securities analysts announcements by either our competitors or customers that fail to meet or be consistent with their earlier projections or the expectations of our investors or securities analysts rumors  announcements  or press articles regarding our competitors operations  management  organization  financial condition  or financial statements changes in revenue and earnings estimates by us  our investors  or securities analysts accounting charges  including charges relating to the impairment of goodwill announcements of planned acquisitions or dispositions by us or by our competitors announcements of new or planned products by us  our competitors  or our customers gain or loss of a significant customer inquiries by the sec  nasdaq  law enforcement  or other regulatory bodies acts of terrorism  the threat of war  and other crises or emergency situations economic slowdowns or the perception of an oncoming economic slowdown in any of the major markets in which we operate the stock market in general  and the market prices of stocks of technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price volatility that has adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business symantec is a global provider of security  storage and systems management solutions that help businesses and consumers secure and manage their information and identities 
fiscal calendar we have a week fiscal year ending on the friday closest to march unless otherwise stated  references to fiscal years in this report relate to fiscal year and periods ended april   april  and april  fiscal and each consisted of weeks  while fiscal consisted of weeks 
our fiscal year will consist of weeks and will end on march  our operating segments our operating segments are significant strategic business units that offer different products and services  distinguished by customer needs 
since the fourth quarter of fiscal  we have operated in five operating segments consumer  security and compliance  storage and server management  services  and other 
for further descriptions of our operating segments  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments 
financial results and trends revenue increased by million for fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  we experienced growth in our security and compliance segment primarily as a result of revenue associated with our fiscal acquisitions 
during fiscal  we acquired the identity and authentication business of verisign  inc verisign  pgp corporation pgp  and guardianedge technologies  inc guardianedge for an aggregate amount of approximately billion  net of cash acquired 
we expect that these acquisitions will continue to contribute positively to our revenue in future periods in the security and compliance segment 
within our storage and server management segment  sales of our information management products experienced growth while we experienced weakness in our storage management solutions 
consumer segment revenues for fiscal benefited from the completion of our transition to an internally developed ecommerce platform for our norton branded consumer products worldwide  excluding japan  during the first quarter of fiscal the fees we had previously paid to digital river for operating our online store for these products were recorded as an offset to revenue  however  we 
table of contents incur expenses resulting from our ecommerce platform  components of which are recorded as a cost of revenue and an operating expense 
fluctuations in the us dollar compared to foreign currencies unfavorably impacted our international revenue by approximately million for fiscal as compared to fiscal and favorably impacted our international revenue by approximately million for fiscal as compared to fiscal we are unable to predict the extent to which revenue in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
if our level of international sales and expenses increase in the future  changes in foreign exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenue and operating results 
our net income attributable to symantec corporation stockholders was million for fiscal and million for our net income for fiscal was negatively impacted by a loss of million from the liquidation of certain foreign entities and million from the impairment of intangible assets  while net income for fiscal was positively affected by a gain of million from the liquidation of certain foreign entities 
our fiscal and fiscal net income were positively impacted relative to the preceding year by a decrease of million and million  respectively  in cost of revenue primarily related to certain acquired product rights becoming fully amortized 
net income for fiscal and fiscal was also positively impacted by tax benefits resulting from the reversal of accrued liabilities and correlative benefits related to the veritas software tax assessment for and of million and million  respectively 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  requires us to make estimates  which include judgments and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
historically  our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions 
if actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition 
a critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact the operating results or financial condition 
we believe that the estimates described below represent our critical accounting estimates  as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
see also note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements under the authoritative guidance on software revenue recognition  and any applicable amendments or modifications 
revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and require us to make many estimates 
for software arrangements that include multiple elements  including perpetual software licenses and maintenance and or services  packaged products with content updates  managed security services  and subscriptions  we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered elements  and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue 
vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately 
we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements 
when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items  the entire arrangement fee is recognized 
table of contents ratably over the performance period 
our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance  consumer product content updates  managed security services  subscriptions  and arrangements where vsoe does not exist 
deferred revenue totaled approximately billion as of april   of which million was classified as long term deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time 
for arrangements that include both software and non software elements  we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and non software deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe and iii best estimate of the selling price esp 
when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use esp to allocate the arrangement fees to the deliverables 
for our consumer products that include content updates  we recognize revenue and the associated cost of revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon sell through to end users  as the subscription period commences on the date of sale to the end user 
we defer revenue and cost of revenue amounts for unsold product held by our distributors and resellers 
we expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer demand  which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand based on recent buying trends 
we ship product to our distributors and resellers at their request and based on valid purchase orders 
our distributors and resellers base the quantity of orders on their estimates to meet future customer demand  which may exceed the expected level of a four or six week supply 
we offer limited rights of return if the inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected level of a four or six week supply 
we estimate reserves for product returns as described below 
we typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level 
because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be returned  we primarily offset deferred revenue against trade accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels 
arrangements for managed security services and saas offerings are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time  and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the maintenance  subscription  or service period 
reserves for product returns 
we reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue based primarily on historical trends 
we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred revenue 
actual product returns may be different than what was estimated 
these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make actual results differ from our return estimates 
reserves for rebates 
we estimate and record reserves for channel and end user rebates as an offset to revenue 
for consumer products that include content updates  rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue over the term of the subscription 
our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs  which are typically entered into quarterly 
our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional programs  actual sales during the promotion  the amount of actual redemptions received  historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program  and the value of the rebate 
we also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates 
if actual redemptions differ from our estimates  material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 
valuation of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets business combination valuations 
when we acquire businesses  we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair 
table of contents values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies and historical experience 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand and competitive position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset  and discount rates 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable  and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates  and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities 
goodwill impairment 
we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  at the reporting unit level 
our reporting units are the same as our operating segments 
before performing the goodwill impairment test  we first assess the value of long lived assets in each reporting unit  including tangible and intangible assets 
we then perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the estimated fair value of equity of each reporting unit to its allocated carrying value book value of equity 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the equity associated with that unit  there is an indicator of impairment and we must perform the second step of the impairment test 
this second step involves determining the implied fair value of that reporting unit s goodwill in a manner similar to the purchase price allocation for an acquired business  using the reporting unit s calculated fair value as an assumed purchase price 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the excess 
the process of estimating the fair value and carrying value of our reporting units equity requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
many assets and liabilities  such as accounts receivable and property and equipment  are not specifically allocated to an individual reporting unit  and therefore  we apply judgment to allocate the assets and liabilities  and this allocation affects the carrying value of the respective reporting units 
similarly  we use judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units based on relative fair values 
the use of relative fair values has been necessary for certain reporting units due to changes in our operating structure in prior years 
to determine a reporting unit s fair value  we use the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit 
we evaluate the reasonableness of this approach by comparing it with the market approach  which involves a review of the carrying value of our assets relative to our market capitalization and to the valuation of publicly traded companies operating in the same or similar lines of business 
applying the income approach requires that we make a number of important estimates and assumptions 
we estimate the future cash flows of each reporting unit based on historical and forecasted revenue and operating costs 
this  in turn  involves further estimates  such as estimates of future revenue and expense growth rates and foreign exchange rates 
in addition  we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation 
this discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit and may change from year to year 
for example  in our valuation process in the fourth quarter of fiscal we used a lower discount rate than in the prior year due to stabilized risk associated with the global economic conditions 
changes in these key estimates and assumptions  or in other assumptions used in this process  could materially affect our impairment analysis for a given year 

table of contents as of april   our goodwill balance was billion 
based on the impairment analysis performed on january   we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the unit by more than of the carrying value 
while discount rates are only one of several important estimates used in the analysis  we determined that an increase of one percentage point in the discount rate used for each respective reporting unit would not have resulted in an impairment indicator for any unit at the time of this analysis  except for the security and compliance reporting unit which would have had a fair value below carrying value 
however  we believe that the discount rate applied to the security and compliance reporting unit is appropriate and we applied the same discount rate for this reporting unit in fiscal as we used in fiscal in addition to the discount rate  the impairment test includes the consideration of a number of estimates  including growth rates  operating margins and cost forecasts  foreign exchange rates and the allocation of certain tangible assets to the reporting units 
based on the results of our impairment test  we do not believe that an impairment indicator exists as of our annual impairment test date 
a number of factors  many of which we have no ability to control  could affect our financial condition  operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed 
these factors include a prolonged global economic crisis  a significant decrease in the demand for our products  the inability to develop new and enhanced products and services in a timely manner  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets  a loss of key personnel  our determination to dispose of one or more of our reporting units  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and recognition of a goodwill impairment loss 
intangible asset impairment 
we assess the impairment of identifiable finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset group s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
recoverability of certain finite lived intangible assets  particularly customer relationships and finite lived tradenames  would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to which the assets are assigned to the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows the asset group is expected to generate 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of such impairment would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value 
recoverability and impairment of other finite lived intangible assets  particularly developed technology and patents  would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of undiscounted estimated future product revenues offset by estimated future costs to dispose of the product to which the asset relates 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  we review impairment on an annual basis consistent with the timing of the annual evaluation for goodwill 
these assets generally include tradenames  trademarks and in process research and development 
recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the discounted estimated future cash flows the asset is expected to generate plus expected royalties 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of such impairment would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value 
our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted future revenue  operating costs  and other relevant factors 
assumptions and estimates about the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are subjective and are affected by changes to our business strategies 
if management s estimates of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our identifiable intangible assets could change significantly 
such change could result in impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents long lived assets including assets held for sale 
we assess long lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable 
based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we assess recoverability of long lived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method using assumptions determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
if an asset is not recoverable  impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors which could change and cause a material impact to our operating results or financial condition 
we record impairment charges on long lived assets held for sale when we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable 
in determining fair value  we obtain and consider market value appraisal information from third parties 
fair value of financial instruments the assessment of fair value for our financial instruments is based on the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements which establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on three levels of inputs and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
we use inputs such as actual trade data  benchmark yields  broker dealer quotes and other similar data which are obtained from independent pricing vendors  quoted market prices or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities 
we use such pricing data as the primary input  to which we have not made any material adjustments  to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio  and we are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates 
the fair value and inputs are reviewed for reasonableness  may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that we deem material to the estimated fair value of our investment portfolio 
as of april   our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included billion of assets which consists of cash equivalents invested in money market funds and bank securities 
investments totalling billion were classified as level and million were classified as level  which are comprised solely of money market funds and bank securities  respectively 
valuations for level securities were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets 
determining fair value for level instruments generally does not require significant management judgment 
valuations for level securities were based on either the fair value of similar securities or pricing models with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market prices for identical securities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets 
while determining the fair value for level instruments does not necessarily require significant management judgment  it generally involves the following degree of judgment and subjectivity an assessment of an active market for marketable securities generally takes into consideration whether a trading market exists for a given instrument or the level of trading volume for each instrument type and when observable market prices for identical securities or similar securities are not available  we may price marketable securities using non binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data  or pricing models  such as discounted cash flow approaches  with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data 
the majority of our level financial instruments were classified as such due to either low trading activity in active markets or no active market existing 
for certain financial instruments  identical securities were used to determine fair value 
for those securities where no active market existed  amortized cost was used as it approximates their fair value because of their short maturities 
as of april   we had no financial instruments with unobservable inputs classified in level under the hierarchy set forth under the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements 
level instruments generally would include those for which unobservable inputs used in the valuation methodology are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities 
the determination of fair value for level instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance  stock based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of the respective award 
determining the fair value of stock based awards  primarily stock options  at the grant date requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the options  actual and projected employee stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors  risk free interest rates  and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected life of options granted based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option 
expected volatility is based on the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of traded options 
the risk free interest rate is equal to the us treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal to the expected life 
we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  our expected dividend yield is zero 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation  we only record stock based compensation expense for awards that are expected to vest 
as a result  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience  actual forfeitures may differ 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted when we record an adjustment for the difference in the period that the awards vest or are forfeited 
contingencies and litigation we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on contingencies 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from a potential claim or legal proceeding  as well as potential ranges of probable losses  when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable 
a determination of the amount of accrued liabilities required  if any  for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
any revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our operating results and financial position 
income taxes we are required to compute our income taxes in each federal  state  and international jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities  including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or long term deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
our judgments  assumptions  and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations 
we account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a two step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be 
table of contents sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  refinement of estimates  or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates 
to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which such determination is made 
we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and  based on this assessment establish a valuation allowance  if required 
our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a number of assumptions  judgments  and estimates  including forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations 
in july  we reached an agreement with the irs concerning our eligibility to claim a lower tax rate on a distribution made from a veritas foreign subsidiary prior to the july acquisition 
the distribution was intended to be made pursuant to the american jobs creation act of  and therefore eligible for a effective us federal rate of tax  in lieu of the statutory rate 
the final impact of this agreement remains uncertain since this relates to the taxability of earnings that are otherwise the subject of the transfer pricing matters at issue in the irs examination of veritas tax years through to the extent that we owe taxes as a result of these transfer pricing matters in years prior to the distribution  we anticipate that the incremental tax due from this negotiated agreement will decrease 
we currently estimate that the most probable outcome from this negotiated agreement will be that we will owe million or less  for which an accrual has already been made

security and compliance operating income decreased for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due to increased expenses related to our fiscal acquisitions and higher sales commissions associated with the increase in deferred revenue in our operating margins were adversely impacted by our fiscal acquisitions  largely because we were required under the purchase accounting rules to reduce the amount of deferred revenue that we recorded in connection with these acquisitions to an amount equal to the fair value of our estimated cost to fulfill the contractual obligations related to that deferred revenue 
this deferred revenue adjustment negatively affected our operating margins because we recognized a lower portion of the revenue from these acquisitions representing our estimated cost to fulfill the contractual obligations plus a normal margin  but we incurred all of the revenue related expenses

as of april   billion of the billion of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
we have provided us deferred taxes on a portion of our undistributed foreign earnings sufficient to address the incremental us tax that would be due if we needed these funds for our operations in the us

in the first quarter of fiscal  we issued billion in principal amount of notes due june  and billion in principal amount of notes due june  in the second quarter of fiscal  we repurchased million of aggregate principal amount of our notes 
interest payments were calculated based on terms of the related notes

these amounts are associated with agreements for purchases of goods or services generally including agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the table above also includes agreements to purchase goods or services that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment 
the amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and we expect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials 
we have entered into various noncancelable operating lease agreements that expire on various dates through the amounts in the table above include million in exited or excess facility costs related to restructuring activities  excluding expected sublease income 
in june  we amended an existing royalty agreement with peter norton for the licensing of certain publicity rights 
as a result  we recorded a long term liability reflecting the net present value of expected future royalty payments due to mr 
norton 
as of april   we reflected million in long term taxes payable related to uncertain tax positions 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond the next twelve months due to uncertainties in the timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits and controversies 
indemnifications as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not limited  however  we have directors and officers insurance coverage that reduces our exposure 
table of contents and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
we provide limited product warranties and the majority of our software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
historically  payments made under these provisions have been immaterial 
we monitor the conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a loss has occurred 
recently issued and adopted authoritative guidance in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted new authoritative guidance which changes the model for determining whether an entity should consolidate a variable interest entity vie 
the standard replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a vie with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a vie and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive the entity s residual returns 
the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements for fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  updated authoritative guidance was issued to modify step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  we will need to consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the adoption of this guidance will be effective beginning april   the first quarter of our fiscal the updated guidance may require us to perform the step for our services reporting unit upon adoption 
the adoption of this guidance could potentially result in an impairment of the goodwill recorded in the services reporting unit of up to million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity prices 
we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies 
we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio and the potential losses arising from changes in interest rates 
our investment objective is to achieve the maximum return compatible with capital preservation and our liquidity requirements 
our strategy is to invest our cash in a manner that preserves capital  maintains sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements  maximizes yields consistent with approved credit risk  and limits inappropriate concentrations of investment by sector  credit  or issuer 
we classify our cash equivalents and short term investments in accordance with the authoritative guidance on investments 
we consider investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents 
we classify our short term investments as available for sale 
short term investments consist of marketable debt or equity securities with original maturities in excess of days 
our cash equivalents and short term investment portfolios consist primarily of money market funds  commercial paper  corporate debt securities  and us government and government sponsored debt securities 
our short term investments do not include equity investments in privately held companies 
our short term investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  included in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
the amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments  realized gains and losses  and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in other income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
we use the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short term investments 

table of contents the following table presents the fair value and hypothetical changes in fair values on short term investments sensitive to changes in interest rates value of securities value of securities given an given an interest interest rate increase of rate decrease of x x basis points bps fair value basis points bps bps bps bps as of bps bps in millions april  april  amount not applicable the modeling technique used above measures the change in fair market value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus bps  plus bps  plus bps  and minus bps 
as of april   we had billion in principal amount of fixed rate senior notes outstanding  with a carrying amount of billion and a fair value of billion  which fair value is based on market prices 
as of april   a hypothetical bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed rate debt by a decrease of approximately million and an increase of approximately million  respectively 
however  this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed rate debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in currencies through our worldwide operations and  as such  we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
foreign currency risks are associated with our cash and cash equivalents  investments  receivables  and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates will result in foreign exchange gains and losses on these foreign currency assets and liabilities and are included in other income  net 
our objective in managing foreign exchange activity is to preserve stockholder value by minimizing the risk of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
our strategy is to primarily utilize forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures 
under our program  gains and losses in our foreign currency exposures are offset by losses and gains on our forward contracts 
our forward contracts generally have terms of one to six months 
at the end of the reporting period  open contracts are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses included in other income  net 
the following table presents a sensitivity analysis on our foreign forward exchange contract portfolio using a statistical model to estimate the potential gain or loss in fair value that could arise from hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of foreign currency value of contracts value of contracts given x given x appreciation of depreciation of foreign foreign currency notional currency foreign forward exchange contracts amount in millions purchased  april  sold  april  purchased  april  sold  april  equity price risk in june  we issued billion in principal amount of notes and billion in principal amount of notes 
we received proceeds of billion from the notes and notes and incurred net transaction costs of approximately million  of which million was allocated to equity and the remainder 
table of contents allocated proportionately to the notes and notes 
the notes and notes were each issued at par and bear interest at and per annum  respectively 
interest is payable semiannually in arrears on june and december concurrent with the issuance of the notes and notes  the company entered into note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain initial purchasers whereby the company has the option to purchase up to million shares of symantec common stock at a price of per share 
the cost of the note hedge transactions was approximately million 
in september  we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of our notes 
concurrently with this repurchase  we sold a proportionate share of the initial note hedges back to the note hedge counterparties for approximately million 
these transactions resulted in a loss from extinguishment of debt of approximately million  which represents the difference between book value of the notes net of the remaining unamortized discount prior to repurchase and the fair value of the liability component of the notes upon repurchase 
the net cost of the repurchase of the notes and the concurrent sale of the note hedges was million in cash 
the convertible senior notes have a fixed annual interest rate and therefore  we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the convertible senior notes 
however  the values of the convertible senior notes are exposed to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of our fixed interest rate convertible senior notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair values of our convertible senior notes are affected by our stock price 
the carrying value of the notes was million as of april  this represents the liability component of the million principal balance as of april  the total estimated fair value of our notes at april  was million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per of the notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was 
the carrying value of the notes was million as of april  this represents the liability component of the billion principal balance as of april  the total estimated fair value of our notes at april  was billion and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per of the notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was 
for business and strategic purposes  we also hold equity interests in several privately held companies  many of which can be considered to be in the start up or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky and we could lose a substantial part or our entire investment in these companies 
these investments are recorded at cost and classified as other long term assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
as of april   these investments had an aggregate carrying value of million
