because this slowing is expected to continue  we anticipate there will be fewer foreclosure notice advertisements and declining revenues in fiscal we do not expect to experience an offsetting increase in commercial advertising as a result of this trend because of the continuing challenges in the commercial advertising business

the company is continuing to contest the issue in the united states tax court  and the ultimate resolution of this dispute cannot be ascertained at this time 
net income per share increased to from 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the company cash and cash equivalents  us treasury and marketable security positions increased by  cash and cash equivalents and us treasury bills were used primarily for the purchase of marketable securities of  and capital assets of  mostly computer software and office equipment 
in february  the company purchased shares of common stock of two fortune companies and certain bonds of a third

the investments in marketable securities  which cost approximately  and had a market value of about  at september  generated about  in dividends and interest income which lowers the effective income tax rate because of the dividends received deduction 
as of september   there were unrealized pretax gains of  as compared to  at september  most of the unrealized gains were in the common stocks 
the cash provided by operating activities of  included a net increase in deferred subscription and other revenues of  proceeds from the sale of subscriptions from newspapers  court rule books and other publications and for software licenses and maintenance and other services are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in earned revenue only when the services are rendered 
cash flows from operating activities increased by  during fiscal as compared to the prior year primarily resulting from a decrease in accounts receivable of  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  as of september   the company had working capital of  including the liability for deferred subscription and other revenues of  which are scheduled to be earned within one year and the deferred tax liability of  for the unrealized gains described above 
the company believes that it will be able to fund its operations for the foreseeable future through its cash flows from operating activities and its current working capital and expects that any such cash flows will be invested in its two businesses 
the company also may entertain business acquisition opportunities 
any excess cash flows will be invested as management and the board of directors deem appropriate at the time 
such investments may include additional securities of the companies in which the company has already invested  securities of other companies  government securities including us treasury notes and bills or other instruments 
the decision as to particular investments will be driven by the company s belief about the risk reward profile of the various investment choices at the time  and it may utilize government securities as a default if attractive opportunities for a better return are not available 
the company s chairman of the board  charles munger  is also the vice chairman of berkshire hathaway inc  which maintains a substantial investment portfolio 
the company s board of directors has utilized his judgment and suggestions  as well as those of jp guerin  the company s vice chairman  when selecting investments  and both of them will continue to play an important role in monitoring existing investments and selecting any future investments 
as noted above  however  the investments are concentrated in just five companies 
accordingly  a significant decline in the market value of one or more of the company s investments may not be offset by the hypothetically better performance of other investments  and that could result in a large decrease in the company s stockholders equity and  under certain circumstances  in the recognition of impairment losses in the company s income statement 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles

accordingly  costs related to the development of new sustain software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized  subject to expected recoverability 
in general  technological feasibility is achieved when the developer has established the necessary skills  hardware and technology to produce a product and a detailed program design has been i completed  ii traced to the product specifications and iii reviewed for high risk development issues
