our telephone number is products our infant and juvenile product line currently consists of approximately  products that principally focus on children of the age group newborn to three years 
we have also recently begun to expand the age range of our addressable consumer market by developing and marketing certain products for children of ages three through seven  including toddler bedding and beds as well as food preparation and kitchen products 
kids line products  which are marketed primarily under the kids line  carter s and disney brands  and cocalo products  which are marketed primarily under the cocalo baby  cocalo couture  and cocalo naturals tm brands  each consist primarily of infant bedding and related nursery accessories and d cor such as blankets  rugs  mobiles  nightlights  hampers  lamps and wall art 
as described below  in  kids line and cocalo products now also include specified kitchen and nursery appliances  diaper bags and spa bath products 
lajobi products  which are marketed primarily under the babi italia  europa baby  bonavita  graco and serta brands  consist primarily of cribs  mattresses and other nursery furniture 
sassy products  which are marketed primarily under the sassy  carter s and garanimals brands  consist primarily of developmental toys and feeding  bath and baby care items with features that address the various stages of an infant s early years 

table of contents in  we introduced several new product categories 
for example  kids line expanded its product offerings to include certain kitchen appliances  food preparation products  nursery appliances and diaper bags 
cocalo also introduced a line of diaper bags  as well as a line of spa bath products 
lajobi introduced a glider chair with a patent pending nursing step ottoman  and several new furniture collections 
sassy introduced a patent pending squirting bath toy designed to help prevent the growth of mold and several new developmental toys and feeding products  and expanded into offerings of licensed carter s and garanimals products 
most of our infant and juvenile products have selling prices between and  with the exception of lajobi furniture products  which have selling prices of to product sales are highly diverse and no single item represented more than of our consolidated net sales in the company currently categorizes its sales in five product categories soft good basics  hard good basics  accessories and d cor  toys and entertainment  and other 
soft good basics includes bedding  blankets and mattresses 
hard good basics includes cribs and other nursery furniture  feeding  food preparation and kitchen products  baby gear and organizers 
accessories and d cor includes hampers  lamps  rugs and d cor 
toys and entertainment includes developmental toys  bath toys and mobiles 
other includes all other products that do not fit in the above four categories 
the following table sets forth the company s consolidated net sales by product category  as a percentage of total consolidated net sales  for the years ended december    and year ended december  hard good basics soft good basics toys and entertainment accessories and d cor other total design and production we maintain a continuing program of new product development 
we design most of our own products  although certain products are designed by independent designers or are licensed from other third parties 
items are added to the product line only if we believe that they can be sourced and marketed on a basis that meets our profitability standards 
generally  a new design is brought to market in less than one year after a decision is made to produce the product 
sales of our products are  in large part  dependent on our ability to anticipate  identify and react quickly to changing consumer preferences and to effectively utilize our sales and distribution systems to bring new products to market 
we occasionally engage in market research and test marketing to evaluate consumer reactions to our products 
research into consumer buying trends often suggests new products 
we assemble information from retail stores  our sales force  focus groups  industry experts  vendors and our product development personnel 
we continually analyze our products to determine whether they should be adapted into new or different products using elements of the initial design or whether they should be removed from the product line 
substantially all of our products are produced by independent manufacturers  generally in eastern asia  under the quality review of individuals whose services have been retained by us 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our east asia quality control staff 
our products are designed  manufactured  packaged and labeled to conform to all applicable safety requirements under us federal and other applicable laws and regulations  various industry developed voluntary standards and product specific standards 
during  we utilized numerous manufacturers in eastern asia for our continuing operations  with facilities primarily in the prc and other eastern asia countries 
during  approximately of our dollar volume of purchases for our continuing operations was attributable to manufacturing in the prc 
members of our eastern asia and us product development staff make frequent visits to such manufacturers 
the prc currently enjoys permanent normal trade relations pntr status under us tariff laws  which generally provides a favorable category of us import duties 
the loss of such pntr status would result in a substantial increase in the import duty for products manufactured for us in the prc and imported into the united states and would result in an increase in our sourcing costs 
in addition  certain categories of wooden bedroom furniture imported from the prc by our lajobi subsidiary are also subject to anti dumping duties 
for a discussion of a charge taken in the fourth quarter and year ended december  for anticipated anti dumping duties and related interest and other actions taken by us in connection with a focused assessment of lajobi s import practices  see item  legal proceedings  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the sections captioned recent developments  earnouts with respect to acquisitions  other events and circumstances pertaining to liquidity and debt financings  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have discontinued the practices that resulted in the charge for anticipated anti dumping duties  and we believe that our ability to procure the affected categories of wooden bedroom furniture will not be materially adversely affected in future periods 

table of contents in  the supplier accounting for the greatest dollar volume of the purchases for our continuing operations accounted for approximately of such purchases  and the five largest suppliers accounted for approximately in the aggregate 
we believe that there are alternate manufacturers for our products and sources of raw materials 
see item a  risk factors we rely on foreign suppliers  primarily in the prc  to manufacture most of our products  which subjects us to numerous international business risks that could increase our costs or disrupt the supply of our products  as well as note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of risks attendant to our foreign operations 
we currently utilize the full time services of approximately individuals in the prc  thailand  hong kong and vietnam who monitor the production process with responsibility for the quality  safety and prompt delivery of our products  as well as certain compliance and product development issues 
we are in the process of establishing subsidiaries in the prc and thailand and it is anticipated that these entities will directly employ these quality control individuals in the future 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the previous retention of certain of these individuals through a company affiliated with the former president of lajobi and various members of his family

marketing and sales our products are marketed through our own direct sales force of full time employees  as well as through independent manufacturers representatives and distributors to retail customers in the united states and certain foreign countries including  but not limited to  mass merchandisers  baby superstores  specialty stores  department stores and boutiques 
during  we maintained a direct sales force and distribution network for our operations in the united states  the united kingdom and australia 
we also maintain relationships with several independent representatives to service select domestic and foreign retail customers  as well as international distributors to service certain retail customers in several foreign countries 
our sales attributable to foreign based operations were million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our consolidated foreign sales from continuing operations  including export sales from the united states  aggregated million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information with respect to revenues from external customers and total assets for each of the years ending december   and  respectively  as well as specified geographic information 
during  we sold infant and juvenile products to approximately  customers worldwide 
toys r us  inc and babies r us  inc  in the aggregate  accounted for approximately  target corporation target accounted for approximately  and wal mart stores  inc walmart accounted for approximately of our consolidated gross sales during the loss of any of these customers  the loss of certain other large customers  or a significant reduction in the volume of business conducted with such customers  could have a material adverse affect on us 
see item a  risk factors our business is dependent on several large customers and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we reinforce the marketing efforts of our sales force through an active promotional program  including showrooms at our principal facilities  participation in trade shows  and trade and consumer advertising  as well as a growing set of internet based promotional activities 
we also seek to further capture synergies between our businesses by cross marketing products and building upon the strong customer relationships developed by each of our subsidiaries  as well as by consolidating certain operational activities 
customer service is an essential component of our marketing strategy 
we maintain customer service departments that respond to customer inquiries  investigate and resolve issues and generally assist customers and or consumers 
our general terms of sale are competitive with others in our industry 
sales are typically made utilizing standard credit terms of to days 
we do not ordinarily sell our products on consignment  and we ordinarily accept returns only for defective merchandise 
in certain instances  where retailers are unable to resell the quantity of products that they have purchased from us  we may  in accordance with industry practice  assist retailers in selling such excess inventory by offering credits and other price concessions 

table of contents distribution many of our customers  particularly mass merchandisers  pick up their goods at our regional distribution centers  which are located in south gate  california  cranbury  new jersey  kentwood  michigan  eastleigh  hampshire united kingdom  and sydney  australia 
we also use common carriers to arrange shipments to customers who request such arrangements  including smaller retailers and specialty stores 
cocalo distributes its products through a previously affiliated third party logistics provider 
lajobi also utilizes the services of independent third party logistics providers in california for a portion of its distribution requirements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and item  certain relationships and related transactions and director independence  for more information regarding cocalo s third party logistics agreement 
seasonality we typically do not experience significant seasonal variations in demand for our products  although we typically do experience slightly higher sales during the second half of the fiscal year 
in  approximately of our net sales were made during the second half of the fiscal year 
sales to our retail customers may be higher in periods when retailers take initial shipments of new products  as these orders typically incorporate enough products to fill each store plus additional amounts to be kept at the customer s distribution center 
the timing of these initial shipments varies by customer depending on when they finalize store layouts for the upcoming year and whether there are any mid year product introductions 
competition the infant and juvenile products industry is highly competitive and is characterized by the frequent introduction of new products and includes numerous domestic and foreign competitors  many of which are substantially larger and have financial and other resources greater than ours 
we compete with a number of different competitors  depending on the product category  and compete against no single company across all of our product categories 
our competition includes large infant and juvenile product companies and specialty infant and juvenile product manufacturers 
we compete principally on the basis of proprietary product design  brand name recognition  product quality  innovation  and relationships with major retailers  customer service and price value relationship 
in addition  certain of our potential customers  in particular mass merchandisers  have the financial and other resources necessary to buy products similar to those that we sell directly from manufacturers in eastern asia and elsewhere  thereby potentially reducing the size of our potential market 
see item a  risk factors competition in our markets could reduce our net sales and profitability 
copyrights  trademarks  patents and licenses we rely on a combination of trademarks  copyrights  patents  licenses and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property 
we believe our intellectual property has significant value  though we do not consider our business to be materially dependent on such intellectual property due to the availability of substitutes our ability to create new designs  and the variety of products that we sell 
intellectual property protections are limited or even unavailable in some foreign countries and preventing unauthorized use of our intellectual property can be difficult even in countries with substantial legal protection 
in addition  the portion of our business that relies on the use of intellectual property is subject to the risk of challenges by third parties claiming infringement of their proprietary rights 
see item  risk factors trademark infringement or other intellectual property claims relating to our products could increase our costs 
we enter into license agreements relating to trademarks  copyrights  patents  designs and products which enable us to market items compatible with our product line 
we believe that our license agreements are important assets for our business 
we currently maintain license agreements with  among others  the william carter company carter s  disney enterprises  inc  graco children s products  inc  and serta  inc 
our license agreements are typically for terms of two to five years with extensions possible if agreed to by both parties 
royalties are paid on licensed products and  in many cases  advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements 
although we do not believe our business is dependent on any single license  the graco license which expires on december   subject to renewals and the carter s license which expires on december   subject to renewals are each material to and accounted for a material portion of the net revenues of lajobi and kids line  respectively  as well as a significant percentage of the net revenues of the company  in each case for each of the last three years 
in addition  the serta license which expires on december   subject to renewals is material to and accounted for a significant percentage of the net revenues of lajobi  the disney license which expires on december   subject to renewals is material to and accounted for a significant percentage of the net revenues of kids line  and the garanimals license which expires on december  is material to and accounted for a significant percentage of the net revenues of sassy  in each case other than garanimals which commenced in for the last three years ended december  while historically we have been able to renew the license agreements that we wish to continue on terms acceptable to us  the loss of any of the foregoing and or other significant license agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  at least until such time  if ever  that appropriate replacements can be secured and related products marketed on commercially acceptable terms 
see item a  risk factors competition for licenses could increase our licensing costs or limit our ability to market products and the loss of any significant license could adversely affect our business

government regulation certain of our products are subject to the provisions of  among other laws  the federal hazardous substances act  the federal consumer product safety act and the federal consumer product safety improvement act 
those laws empower the consumer product safety commission the cpsc to protect consumers from certain hazardous articles by regulating their use or excluding them from the market and requiring the recall of products that are found to be potentially hazardous 
the cpsc s determination is subject to judicial review 
similar laws exist in some states and cities in the united states and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which our products are sold 
we maintain a quality control program in order to comply with such laws  and we believe we are in substantial compliance with all the foregoing laws 
notwithstanding the foregoing  no assurance can be made that all products are or will be free from hazards or defects  or that rapidly changing safety standards will not render unsaleable products that complied with previously applicable safety standards

risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below constitute the material risks pertaining to our business 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs  our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
in such cases  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose part or all of your investment 
our net sales and profitability depend on our ability to continue to conceive  design and market products that appeal to consumers 
the introduction of new products is critical in our industry and to our growth strategy 
a significant percentage of our product line is replaced each year with new products 
our business depends on our ability to continue to conceive  design and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of our product offerings 
rapidly changing consumer preferences and trends make it difficult to predict how long consumer demand for our existing products will continue or which new products will be successful 
our current products may not continue to be popular or new products that we introduce may not achieve adequate consumer acceptance for us to recover development  manufacturing  marketing and other costs 
a decline in consumer demand for our products  our failure to develop new products on a timely basis in anticipation of changing consumer preferences or the failure of our new products to achieve and sustain consumer acceptance could reduce our net sales and profitability 
in addition  changes in customer preferences leave us vulnerable to an increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
thus  our ability to manage our inventories properly is an important factor in our operations 
inventory shortages can adversely affect the timing of shipments to customers and diminish sales and brand loyalty 
conversely  excess inventories can result in lower gross margins due to the excessive discounts and markdowns that might be necessary to reduce inventory levels 
our inability to effectively manage our inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
gross margin could be adversely affected by several factors 
gross margin may be adversely affected in the future by increases in vendor costs including as a result of increases in the cost of raw materials  labor or other costs or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  excess inventory  obsolescence charges  changes in shipment volume or freight rates  price competition and changes in channels of distribution or in the mix of products sold 
for example  increased costs in the prc  primarily for labor  raw materials  and the impact of certain tax laws  as well as the appreciation of the chinese yuan against the us dollar  have at times negatively impacted our gross margins 
in addition  pressure from major retailers  primarily as a result of continued challenging economic conditions  to offer additional mark downs and other credits or price concessions to clear existing inventory and secure new product placements  have and may continue to negatively impact our margins 
economic conditions  such as rising fuel prices and currency exchange fluctuations  may also adversely impact our margins 
our kids line and cocalo businesses use significant quantities of cotton  either in the form of cotton fabric or cotton polyester fabric 
cotton is subject to ongoing price fluctuations because it is an agricultural product impacted by changing weather patterns  disease and other factors  such as supply and demand considerations  both domestically and internationally 
cotton prices dramatically increased during  impacting fabric availability and costs 
in addition  increased oil prices affect key components of the raw material prices in many of our products 
significant increases in the prices of cotton or oil have and could adversely affect our gross margins and our operations 
in addition  for the fourth quarter and year ended december   we recorded a charge in the amount of approximately  which includes approximately  of interest for import duties that we currently anticipate will be owed by our lajobi subsidiary to us customs and border protection us customs  with respect to incorrect import duties applied on certain wooden furniture imported from the prc 
the charge was recorded in cost of sales other than the interest portion  which was recorded in interest expense  and adversely affected gross margins and net income for the relevant periods 
this accrual results from an ongoing investigation into  among other things  lajobi s import practices  initiated at the direction of the board of directors  and supervised by a special committee of three non management members of the board  following the discovery of certain potential issues in our preparation for the commencement of a focused assessment of lajobi s import practices by us customs 
as the focused assessment is still pending  it is possible that the actual amount of duty owed for the period covered thereby will be higher upon its completion and  in any event  additional interest will continue to accrue on the amounts we currently anticipate we will owe until payment is made 
in addition  we may be assessed by us customs a penalty of up to of any customs duty owed  as well as possibly being subject to fines  penalties or other measures from us customs or other governmental authorities 
any amounts owed in excess of the accrual recorded for the fourth quarter and full year ended december  will adversely affect our gross margin and net income for the period s in which such amounts are recorded and could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our licensors  vendors and or retail partners will not take adverse action under applicable agreements with the company or otherwise as a result of the matters described above 
see item  legal proceedings  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the sections entitled recent developments  earnouts with respect to acquisitions and debt financings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements  for a discussion of the focused assessment  the internal investigation and other actions taken by us in connection therewith 
we have discontinued the practices that resulted in the charge for anticipated anti dumping duty  and we believe that our ability to procure the affected categories of wooden bedroom furniture will not be materially adversely affected in future periods 

table of contents our business is dependent on several large customers 
the continued success of our infant and juvenile businesses depends on our ability to continue to sell our products to several large mass market retailers 
in particular  toys r us  inc and babies r us  inc considered together  target corporation and wal mart stores  inc accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated gross sales for the calendar year 
while the consolidation of our customer base may provide certain benefits to us  such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution  we typically do not have long term contracts with our customers and our agreements with these customers do not require them to purchase any specific number or amount of our products 
as a result  agreements with respect to pricing  returns  cooperative advertising or special promotions or allowances  among other things  are subject to periodic negotiation with each customer 
no assurance can be given that these or other customers will continue to do business with us or that they will maintain their historical levels of business  and the loss of one or more of the foregoing customers or one or more of our other large customers could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
in addition  our success depends upon the continuing willingness of large retailers to purchase and provide shelf space for our products 
our access to shelf space at retailers for our products may be reduced by store closings  consolidation among these retailers  competition from other products or stricter requirements for infant and juvenile products by retailers that we may not be able to meet 
an adverse change in our relationship with  or the financial viability of  one or more of our customers could reduce our net sales and profitability 
competition in our markets could reduce our net sales and profitability 
we operate in highly competitive markets 
certain of our competitors have greater brand recognition and greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we have 
in addition  we may face competition from new participants in our markets because the infant and juvenile product industry has limited barriers to entry 
many of our principal customers are large mass merchandisers 
the rapid growth of these large mass merchandisers  together with changes in consumer shopping patterns  have contributed to the formation of dominant multi category retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers 
current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers  demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times 
other trends are for retailers to import products directly from factory sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands that compete with our products 
the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which our principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use  resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for consumer meaningful brands  the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products  continuing improvements in customer service  and the maintenance of strong relationships with large  high volume purchasers 
we also face the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of our major retailer customers  such as overall store and inventory reductions and retailer consolidation 
the resulting risks include possible loss of sales  reduced profitability and limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases 
we also experience price competition for our products  competition for shelf space at retailers and competition for licenses  all of which may increase in the future 
if we cannot compete successfully in the future  our net sales and profitability will likely decline 

table of contents to compete successfully  we must develop and maintain consumer meaningful brands 
our ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on our ability to develop and maintain consumer meaningful brands so that our retailer customers will need our products to meet consumer demand 
the development and maintenance of such brands requires significant investment in brand building and marketing initiatives  although any such investment may not deliver the anticipated results 
the state of the economy may impact our business 
our business and results of operations are affected by international  national and regional economic conditions 
the united states and many other international economies experienced a major recession in recent periods  with continuing effects for our industry 
the end users of our products are individual consumers 
a hesitant recovery in the u 
s economy  high unemployment  volatile capital markets  depressed housing prices and tight consumer lending practices have resulted in considerable negative pressure on consumer spending and consumer confidence  which we believe has resulted in lower birth rates and could result in reduced demand for our products 
in the event that current economic conditions worsen  current and potential consumers of our products may be inclined to delay their purchases  and further tightening of credit markets may restrict our customers both direct and indirect ability and willingness to make purchases 
in addition  continuing adverse global economic conditions in our markets could result in increased price competition for our products  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories  increased risk in the collectability of accounts receivable from our direct customers  increased risk in potential reserves for doubtful accounts and write offs of accounts receivable  delays in signing or failing to sign direct customer contracts or signing customer agreements at reduced purchase levels  and limitations in the capital resources available to us and others with whom we conduct business 
any of the foregoing effects could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition and could adversely affect our stock price 
product liability  product recalls and other claims relating to the use of our products could increase our costs 
we face product liability risks relating to the use of our products 
we also must comply with a variety of product safety and product testing regulations 
in particular  our products are subject to  among other statutes and regulations  the consumer product safety act  the federal hazardous substances act  or the fhsa  and the consumer product safety improvement act  or the cpsia  which empower the consumer product safety commission  or the cpsc  to take action against hazards presented by consumer products  including adjudication and promulgation of regulations and uniform safety standards 
with expanded authority under the cpsia  the cpsc has and continues to adopt new regulations for safety and products testing that apply to substantially all of our products 
these new regulations have and are expected to further significantly increase the regulatory requirements governing the manufacture and sale of infant and juvenile products and increase the potential penalties for noncompliance with applicable regulations 
the cpsc has the authority to exclude from the market and recall certain consumer products that are found to be potentially hazardous 
consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in canada  australia and europe  as well as certain other countries 
while we take the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future  or that rapidly changing safety standards will not render unsaleable products that complied with previously applicable safety standards 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations  or if we face product liability claims  we may be subject to damage awards or settlement costs that exceed any available insurance coverage  we may incur significant costs in complying with recall requirements  and our financial results could be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  concerns about potential liability or potential future changes in product safety regulations may lead us to recall voluntarily or otherwise discontinue selling selected products 
recalls  post manufacture repairs of our products  or product liability claims could also harm our reputation  increase our costs or reduce our net sales 
governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future or take other actions that may adversely impact infant and juvenile products  including the categories of products that we produce and sell 
in addition  one or more of our customers might require changes or impose their own standards for our products  such as the non use of certain materials or a refusal to sell certain products 
complying with existing or any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business 
similarly  increased penalties for non compliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations 
furthermore  substantially all of our licenses give the licensor the right to terminate the license agreement if any products marketed under the license are subject to a product liability claim  recall or similar violations of product safety regulations or if we breach covenants relating to the safety of the products or their compliance with product safety regulations 
a termination of a license could adversely affect our net sales 
even if a product liability claim is without merit  the claim could harm our reputation and divert management s attention and resources from our business 

table of contents if we lose key personnel we may not be able to achieve our objectives 
we are dependent on the continued efforts of various members of senior management  as well as senior executives of several of our subsidiaries 
if for any reason  these or other key members of management do not continue to be active in management  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to attract and retain senior executives or other personnel necessary for the continued success of our business 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the sections entitled recent developments and earnouts with respect to acquisitions for a discussion of the termination of the employment of lawrence bivona  the former president of lajobi  effective march  we are currently party to litigation that could be costly to defend and distracting to management 
as of the date of this report  a purported class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of persons who allegedly purchased our common stock between march  and march  the lawsuit names us and certain of our current officers and certain of our current and former directors  as defendants 
the complaint alleges one claim for relief pursuant to section b of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  and rule b promulgated thereunder  and a second claim pursuant to section a of the exchange act  claiming generally that we and or the other defendants issued materially false and misleading statements during the relevant time period regarding compliance with customs laws  our financial reports and internal controls 
the complaint does not state the size of the class or quantify the amount of damages sought 
additional litigation may be initiated against us based on the alleged items at issue in the complaint described above 
we cannot predict the outcome of the existing lawsuit or the likelihood that further proceedings will be instituted against us 
the cost of defending against the existing lawsuit or any future lawsuits or proceedings may be high  and these legal proceedings may also result in the diversion of our management s time and attention away from our business 
in the event that there is an adverse ruling in any legal proceeding  we may be required to make payments to third parties that could harm our business or financial results 
we may not be able to collect outstanding accounts receivable from our major retail customers 
certain of our retail customers purchase large quantities of our products on credit  which may cause a concentration of accounts receivable among some of our largest customers 
our profitability may be harmed if one or more of our largest customers were unable or unwilling to pay these accounts receivable when due or demand credits or other concessions for products they are unable to sell or for other reasons 
competition for licenses could increase our licensing costs or limit our ability to market products 
we market a significant portion of our products through licenses with other parties 
sales of licensed products represented of our net sales in fiscal year these licenses are generally limited in scope and duration and generally authorize the sale of specific licensed products on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis 
our license agreements often require us to make minimum guaranteed royalty payments that may exceed the amount we are able to generate from actual sales of the licensed products 
any termination of or failure to renew our significant licenses  or inability to develop and enter into new licenses  could limit our ability to market our licensed products or develop new products  and could reduce our net sales and profitability 
competition for licenses could require us to pay licensors higher royalties and higher minimum guaranteed payments in order to obtain or retain attractive licenses  which could increase our expenses 
in addition  licenses granted to other parties  whether or not exclusive  could limit our ability to market products  including products we currently market  which could cause our net sales and profitability to decline 
our debt covenants may affect our liquidity or limit our ability to complete acquisitions  incur debt  make investments  sell assets  merge or complete other significant transactions 
our current credit agreement includes provisions that place limitations on a number of our activities  including our ability to incur additional debt  create liens on our assets or make guarantees  make certain investments or loans  pay dividends  repurchase our common stock  dispose of or sell assets  or enter into acquisitions  mergers or similar transactions 
these covenants could restrict our ability to pursue opportunities to expand our business operations 
we are required to make prepayments of our debt upon the occurrence of certain transactions  including most asset sales or debt or equity issuances and extraordinary receipts 

table of contents inability to maintain compliance with the bank covenants 
our ability to maintain compliance with the financial and other covenants in our current credit agreement is dependent upon our ability to continue to execute our business model and current operational plans 
see the state of the economy may impact our business above 
if an event of default in such covenants occurs and is continuing  among other things  the lenders may accelerate the loans  declare the commitments thereunder to be terminated  seize collateral or take other actions of secured creditors 
if the loans are accelerated or commitments terminated  we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to dispose of material assets or operations  seek to obtain equity capital  or restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
such alternative measures may not be available or successful 
also  our bank covenants may limit our ability to dispose of material assets or operations or to restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
even if we are able to restructure or refinance our indebtedness  the economic terms may not be favorable to us 
in addition  an event of default under our credit agreement could result in a cross default under certain license agreements that we maintain 
all of the foregoing could have serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section captioned debt financings  as well as note of notes to consolidated financial statements  for a discussion of a waiver and amendment to our credit agreement required to address  among other things  an unmatured event of default with respect to a breach of a financial covenant resulting from the charge to cost of sales and interest expense recorded in the fourth quarter and year ended december  in connection with the internal investigation of lajobi s import practices and business and staffing practices in asia described in item  legal proceedings  below 
our cash flows and capital resources may be insufficient to make required payments on our indebtedness 
our ability to generate cash to meet scheduled payments with respect to our debt depends on our financial and operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and the other factors discussed in this risk factors section 
if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations  we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to dispose of material assets or operations  seek to obtain equity capital  or restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
as discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor  such alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt services obligations 
the breach of any covenants or restrictions in our credit agreement could result in a default thereunder  which would permit the lenders to take the actions discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor 
in addition  an event of default under our credit agreement could result in a cross default under certain license agreements that we maintain 
as discussed above  this could have serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent 
increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our profitability and cash flows 
the loans under our credit agreement bear interest  at our option  at a base rate or at libor  plus applicable margins  which vary between and on libor borrowings and and on base rate borrowings base rate borrowings include a floor of day libor plus 
at december   the applicable margins were for libor borrowings and for base rate borrowings 
increases in the interest rate under our credit agreement will increase our interest expense  which could harm our profitability and cash flow 
further potential disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of short term funds for liquidity requirements and our ability to meet long term commitments  which could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
if sufficient internal funds are not available from our operations  we may be required to further rely on the banking and credit markets to meet our financial commitments and short term liquidity needs 
disruptions in the capital and credit markets  as were experienced during and  could adversely affect our ability to draw on our bank revolving credit facility 
our access to funds under our credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to such facility to meet their funding commitments 
those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from us and other borrowers within a short period of time 
longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty  changing or increased regulation  reduced alternatives  or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business 
any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged 
such measures could include deferring capital expenditures  and reducing or eliminating discretionary uses of cash 

table of contents federal and state statutes allow courts  under certain specific circumstances  to void purchase transactions in the event of the bankruptcy of the purchaser 
under current federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws  in the event of the bankruptcy of a purchaser of the company s assets  the sale transaction may be voided or cancelled  and damages imposed on the company  if  among other things  such purchaser  at the time the transaction was consummated  received less than reasonably equivalent value for the consideration paid  and either was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such transaction 
the measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws vary depending upon the particular law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer or conveyance has occurred 
with respect to the sale of the company s gift business to trc  we believe that  on the basis of historical financial information  operating history and other factors  trc did receive reasonably equivalent value for the consideration paid by trc  and that trc was neither insolvent prior or subsequent to the consummation of the transaction 
we cannot assure you  however  as to what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard 
in addition  although we obtained a solvency opinion in connection with this transaction confirming our position as to trc s solvency  we cannot assure you what weight  if any  would be accorded thereto by a court 
an adverse determination with respect to any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
if our divested gift business fails to satisfy certain obligations relating to their operations  we could face third party claims seeking to hold us liable for those obligations 
in december of  we completed the sale of our gift business to trc 
we remain contingently liable to third parties for some obligations of the gift business  such as a real estate lease assumed by trc in the transaction  and may remain contingently liable for certain contracts and other obligations that have not been novated  in either case if trc fails to meet its obligations 
the real estate lease referred to above was terminated in december and  while we have been informed that trc and the landlord have agreed to allow trc to occupy the premises under certain conditions  we remain contingently liable for certain amounts that were due and outstanding on the termination date should they remain unpaid and no accommodation is secured from the landlord 
our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we receive any such third party claims 
we rely on foreign suppliers  primarily in the prc  to manufacture most of our products  which subjects us to numerous international business risks that could increase our costs or disrupt the supply of our products 
all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated companies  most of which are in the far east  principally in the prc 
approximately of our dollar volume of purchases for our operations in were attributable to manufacturers in the prc 
the supplier accounting for the greatest dollar volume of purchases for our continuing operations accounted for approximately and the five largest suppliers accounted for approximately in the aggregate during while we believe that there are many other manufacturing sources available for our product lines  difficulties encountered by one or several of our larger suppliers such as a fire  accident  natural disaster or an outbreak of illness eg  hn  sars  avian or other flu at one or more of their facilities  could halt or disrupt production at the affected facilities  delay the completion of orders  cause the cancellation of orders  delay the introduction of new products or cause us to miss a selling season applicable to some of our products 
in addition  our international operations subject us to certain other risks some of which are discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor and below  including economic and political instability  restrictive actions by foreign governments  changing international political relations  labor availability and cost  changes in laws  including tax or labor laws  or changes in regulations  treaties and policies  changes in shipping costs and availability of sufficient cargo capacity  changes in the availability and cost of raw materials  greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting intellectual property rights  changes in import duties or import or export restrictions including changes that could be imposed retroactively  delays in shipping of product and unloading of product through ports  as well as timely rail truck delivery to our warehouses and or a customer s warehouse  complications in complying with the laws and policies of the united states affecting the importation of goods  including duties  quotas and taxes see gross margin could be adversely affected by several factors above  complications in complying with trade and foreign tax laws  and the effects of terrorist activity  armed conflict and epidemics 

table of contents any of these risks could disrupt the supply of our products or increase our expenses 
the costs of compliance with trade and foreign tax laws may increase our expenses and actual or alleged violations of such laws could result in enforcement actions or financial penalties that could result in substantial costs 
in addition  the introduction or expansion of certain social programs in the prc or otherwise will likely increase the cost of doing business for certain of our manufacturers  which would likely increase our manufacturing costs 
with most of our manufacturers located in the far east  we must commit to production in advance of customer orders 
if we fail to forecast customer or consumer demand accurately  we may encounter difficulties in filling customer orders on a timely basis or in liquidating excess inventories 
another recent development affecting many companies importing goods from the prc is that it has become increasingly difficult to secure cargo capacity on a timely basis and at contracted prices 
this may signal a trend of higher ocean freight transportation prices in coming periods 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
historically  labor in the prc has been readily available at relatively low cost as compared to labor costs in north america 
the prc has experienced rapid social  political and economic change in recent years 
there is no assurance labor will continue to be available in the prc at costs consistent with historical levels or that changes in labor or other laws will not be enacted which would have a material adverse effect on product costs in the prc 
if our suppliers suffer labor shortages  this may result in future supply delays and disruptions and drive a substantial increase in labor costs 
any failure to fully comply with the laws of various asian jurisdictions could cause potential liability and have other adverse effects 
lawrence bivona  the former president of lajobi  inc  along with various family members  established l j industries in asia to provide quality control  compliance and certain other services to lajobi for goods being shipped by lajobi from asian ports 
pursuant to the terms of a transition services agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition of lajobi  commencing in april  we utilized the full time services of approximately employees of l j industries for such services 
we ceased making direct payments to l j industries in june  when we became aware that l j industries has ceased operations 
however  we continued to pay for the services of approximately of the former employees of l j industries based in hong kong  china  vietnam and thailand  including through an individual based in hong kong 
companies retaining the services of individuals in these jurisdictions are subject to a variety of foreign laws 
the company believes that the payment and other practices with respect to quality control  compliance and certain other services in hong kong  china  vietnam and thailand violated civil laws and potentially violated criminal laws in these jurisdictions  however  the company currently does not believe that any such violations will have a material adverse effect on the company  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
lajobi has since discontinued the above described manner of paying individuals providing such services in the prc and hong kong  and has taken corrective action by establishing interim arrangements which it believes are currently in compliance with applicable requirements in such jurisdictions  and is in the process of establishing subsidiaries in the prc through which the company intends to directly employ the quality control individuals in these jurisdictions in the future 
with respect to thailand and vietnam  we are investigating appropriate corrective interim arrangements  and are in the process of establishing a subsidiary in thailand through which the company intends to directly employ the quality control individuals in these jurisdictions in the future 
although we believe that once these subsidiaries are fully established  the company will be in compliance with applicable laws of the relevant asian countries  no assurance can be given that applicable governmental authorities will concur with such a view and will not impose taxes or penalties or other measures with respect to staffing practices prior thereto 
the board is continuing to review the extent to which lajobi s payment and other practices for the above described services in asia may have breached other laws  whether any penalties or other measures may be assessed against lajobi  the company or any related personnel as a result  and what remedial actions may be advisable or required 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our licensors  vendors and or retail partners will not take adverse action under applicable agreements with us or otherwise as a result of such potential compliance issues 
because the investigation is ongoing  there can be no assurance as to how the resulting consequences  if any  may impact our internal controls  business  reputation  results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents we may have difficulty establishing adequate management  legal and financial controls in the prc and other asian countries 
the prc and certain other asian jurisdictions have historically had fewer or less developed management and financial reporting concepts and practices  as well as modern banking  computer  and other control systems 
we may experience difficulty in hiring and or retaining a sufficient number of qualified individuals in such jurisdictions 
as a result  we may experience difficulty in establishing management  legal  and financial controls  collecting financial data and preparing financial statements  books of account  and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet business standards such as those in the united states 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could increase our expenses 
our net sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  except for a small amount of net sales denominated in uk pounds  australian dollars and euros 
our purchases of finished goods from eastern asian manufacturers are denominated in us dollars 
expenses for these manufacturers are denominated in chinese yuan or other eastern asian currencies 
as a result  any material increase in the value of the yuan or such other currencies relative to the us or australian dollars or the uk pound would increase the prices at which we purchase finished goods and therefore could adversely affect our profitability 
we are also subject to exchange rate risk relating to transfers of funds denominated in uk pounds  australian dollars or euros from our foreign subsidiaries to the united states 
trademark infringement or other intellectual property claims relating to our products could increase our costs 
we have from time to time received claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property relating to certain of our products  and we may face similar claims in the future 
the defense of intellectual property litigation can be both costly and disruptive of the time and resources of our management  even if the claim is without merit 
we also may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs to resolve intellectual property litigation 
in addition  these claims could materially harm our brand name  reputation and operations 
if our products are copied or knocked off  our sales of these products may be materially reduced and our profitability may be negatively affected 
occasionally in the infant and juvenile industry  successful products are knocked off or copied by competitors 
while we strive to protect our intellectual property  we cannot guarantee that knock offs will not occur or that they will not have a significant effect on our business 
the costs incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights could be significant  and there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully protect our rights see preceding risk factor 
significant changes in the ability to transfer capital across borders could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
government action may restrict our ability to transfer capital across borders in the countries where we conduct business or have invested capital 
significant changes in our ability to transfer our capital across borders could have a significant adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we may experience difficulties in integrating strategic acquisitions 
as part of our growth strategy  we may pursue acquisitions that are consistent with our mission and enable us to leverage our competitive strengths 
the integration of acquired companies and their operations into our operations involves a number of risks including possible failure to maintain customer  licensor and other relationships after the closing of the transaction of the acquired company  the acquired business may experience losses which could adversely affect our profitability  unanticipated costs relating to the integration of acquired businesses may increase our expenses  difficulties in achieving planned cost savings and synergies may increase our expenses or decrease our net sales  diversion of management s attention could impair their ability to effectively manage our business operations  and unanticipated management or operational problems or liabilities may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition  or possible failure to obtain any necessary consents to the transfer of licenses or other agreements of the acquired company 

table of contents additionally  we financed our acquisitions of kids line  lajobi and cocalo with senior debt financing 
this debt leverage  or additional leverage that may be incurred with any other future acquisitions  could adversely affect our profitability and limit our ability to capitalize on future business opportunities 
disruptions in our current information technology systems or difficulties in implementing our new information technology system could harm our business 
system failure or malfunctioning in our information technology systems may result in disruption of operations and the inability to process transactions and could adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  we commenced the implementation in december of a new consolidated information technology system for the company  which we believe will provide greater efficiencies and greater reporting capabilities than those provided by the current separate systems in place across our individual infant and juvenile companies 
in connection with such implementation which now includes functionality enhancements beyond the original project concept  we anticipate incurring total costs of approximately million  of which million has been incurred as of december  we anticipate that the balance of the costs will be incurred in and the first half of as a result of this implementation our business may be subject to transitional difficulties as we replace the current systems 
these difficulties may include disruption of our operations  loss of data  and the diversion of our management and key employees attention away from other business matters 
the difficulties associated with any such implementation  and our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from the implementation  could harm our business  results of operations and cash flows 
changes in our effective tax rate  or changes in tax laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our future effective tax rate and the amount of our provision for income taxes may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns  increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes  changes in available tax credits  changes in share based compensation expense  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes in accounting standards or tax laws and regulations  or interpretations thereof  the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed  the resolution of issues arising from uncertain positions and tax audits with various tax authorities  and penalties and or interest expense that we may be required to recognize on liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions 
we are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions around the world 
in preparing our financial statements  we calculate our effective income tax rate based on current tax laws and regulations and the estimated taxable income within each of these jurisdictions 
our effective income tax rate  however  may be higher due to numerous factors  including those enumerated above 
a significantly higher effective income tax rate could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and liquidity 
officials in some of the jurisdictions in which we do business  including the united states  have proposed  or announced that they are reviewing tax increases and other revenue raising laws and regulations 
any resulting changes in tax laws or regulations could impose new restrictions  costs or prohibitions on our current practices and reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows 

table of contents actual results differing from estimates 
if actual events  circumstances  outcomes and amounts differ from judgments  assumptions and estimates made or used in determining the amount of certain assets including the amount of recoverability of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  liabilities including accruals for income taxes and liabilities and or other items reflected in our consolidated financial statements  it could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
increased costs associated with corporate governance compliance may affect our results of operations and financial condition  and may make it more difficult to attract and retain officers and directors 
the sarbanes oxley act of has required changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure and compliance practices  and requires ongoing review of our internal control procedures 
these developments have increased our legal compliance and financial reporting costs  and to the extent that we identify areas of our disclosures controls and procedures and or internal controls requiring improvement we may have to incur additional costs and divert management s time and attention 
any such action could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  we have not yet fully determined the potential financial and compliance impact of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act which was enacted in july as a public entity  the company expects these new rules and regulations to increase compliance costs as we evaluate the implications of new rules and respond to new requirements 
delays or a failure to comply with the new laws  rules and regulations could result in enforcement actions  the assessment of other penalties and civil suits 
these laws and regulations make it more expensive for us under indemnities provided by the company to our officers and directors 
in addition  these new rules and regulations may make it more difficult and expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
as a result  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve as directors or as executive officers 
the trading price of our common stock has been volatile and investors in our common stock may experience substantial losses 
the trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future

the recently enacted united states federal legislation on healthcare reform and proposed amendments thereto could impact the healthcare benefits required to be provided by us and cause our compensation costs to increase  potentially reducing our net income and adversely affecting our cash flows 
the united states federal healthcare legislation enacted in and proposed amendments thereto contain provisions which could materially impact the future healthcare costs of the company 
while the legislation s ultimate impact is not yet known  it is possible that these changes could significantly increase our compensation costs which would reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows 
various restrictions in our charter documents  policies  new jersey law and our credit agreement could prevent or delay a change in control of us which is not supported by our board of directors 
we are subject to a number of provisions in our charter documents  policies  new jersey law and our credit agreement that may discourage  delay or prevent a merger  acquisition or change of control that a stockholder may consider favorable

table of contents item legal proceedings in late december  our lajobi subsidiary was selected by us customs for a focused assessment of its import practices and procedures  which focused assessment commenced on january  in preparing for the focused assessment  which is ongoing  we found certain potential issues with respect to lajobi s import practices 
as a result  our board of directors initiated an investigation  supervised by a special committee of three non management members of the board 
the board s investigation found instances at lajobi in which incorrect import duties were applied on certain wooden furniture imported from vendors in the prc  resulting in a violation of anti dumping regulations 
on the basis of the investigation  the board concluded that there was misconduct involved on the part of certain lajobi employees in connection with the incorrect payment of duties  including misidentifying the manufacturer and shipper of products 
as a result  effective march   lajobi s president  lawrence bivona  and lajobi s managing director of operations were both terminated from employment 
promptly upon becoming aware of such issues and related misconduct  the company voluntarily disclosed its findings to the sec on an informal basis and is cooperating with the staff of the sec as it reviews this matter 
upon completion of the investigation into lajobi s import practices  we currently expect to complete a voluntary prior disclosure to us customs identifying certain underpayments of import duty  and remit payment of customs duty not paid  with interest thereon 
accordingly  for the fourth quarter and year ended december   we recorded a charge in the amount of approximately  which includes approximately  of interest for import duties we anticipate will be owed to us customs by lajobi in respect of such underpayments 
this charge was recorded in cost of sales other than the interest portion  which was recorded in interest expense  and adversely affected gross margins and net income for the affected periods 
it is possible that the actual amount of duty owed with respect to the focused assessment will be higher upon completion thereof  and in any event  additional interest will continue to accrue on the amounts we currently anticipate we will owe until payment is made 
in addition  we may be assessed by us customs a penalty of up to of any customs duty owed  as well as possibly being subject to fines  penalties or other measures from us customs or other governmental authorities 
any amounts owed in excess of the accrual recorded for will adversely affect our gross margin and net income for the period s in which such amounts may be recorded and could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
we have discontinued the practices that resulted in the charge for anticipated anti dumping duty  and we believe that our ability to procure the affected categories of wooden bedroom furniture will not be materially adversely affected in future periods 
we are committed to working closely with us customs to address issues relating to incorrect import duties  and have also initiated certain enhancements to our processes and procedures in areas where underpayments were found  and will be reviewing these and possibly other remedial measures 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our licensors  vendors and or retail partners will not take adverse action under applicable agreements with the company or otherwise as a result of the matters described above
