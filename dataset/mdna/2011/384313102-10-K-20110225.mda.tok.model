table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is designed to provide information that is supplemental to  and should be read together with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
information in this item is intended to assist the reader in obtaining an understanding of our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  the primary factors that accounted for those changes  any known trends or uncertainties that we are aware of that may have a material effect on our future performance  as well as how certain accounting principles affect our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  this item provides information about our business segments and how the results of those segments impact our financial condition and results of operation as a whole 
executive summary on november   we announced the acquisitions of seadrift and c g 
as a result of these acquisitions  our results of operations and md a analysis for include one month of activity of seadrift and c g 
we have five major product categories graphite electrodes  refractory products  needle coke products  advanced graphite materials  and natural graphite products 
reportable segments 
our businesses are reported in the following categories industrial materials  which consists of graphite electrodes  refractory products and needle coke products 
engineered solutions  which includes advanced graphite materials and natural graphite products 
reference is made to the information under part i for background information on our businesses  industry and related matters 
global economic conditions and outlook we are impacted in varying degrees  both positively and negatively  as global  regional or country conditions fluctuate 
our discussions about market data and global economic conditions below are based on or derived from published industry accounts and statistics 
outlook 
based on current international monetary fund imf projections and other global economic forecasts  world output is projected to expand an average of percent in however  degrees of growth will vary in both advanced and emerging economies 
imf notes that advanced economies are expected to continue to grow at a subdued pace  while emerging economies are anticipated to advance at a more rapid pace given robust internal demand and strong capital inflows 
however  downside risks remain to the stability of the global recovery 
according to the world steel association s published reports  global steel operating rates were roughly flat in the fourth quarter of at percent capacity utilization  as compared to the third quarter of for the full year  global steel operating rates were percent given stronger first half production levels relative to the second half of total steel production levels are expected to improve in  however  operating rates in the primary markets we serve are anticipated to remain below pre crisis levels 
we expect results to benefit from improved volumes in our graphite electrode business  however  this impact will be partially offset due to pressure on average graphite electrode selling prices 
for the full year  we are targeting cash flow from operations to be in the range of million to million  an improvement of approximately percent 
on the capital front  we are targeting expenditures of approximately million to million in  as we fund internal engineered solutions growth initiatives  support seadrift s and st 
marys quality improvement plans and improve operational efficiency across our global platform 
we are targeting overhead expense to be in the range of million to million 
the year over year increase largely relates to million amortization of acquisition related intangibles and 
table of contents million higher administrative expense due to the inclusion of the seadrift and st 
marys teams 
we are targeting interest expense in the range of million to million  depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million  an effective tax rate in the range of percent to percent and a fully dilute share count of approximate million shares 
our outlook could be significantly impacted by  among other things  factors described under item a risk factors and item a forward looking statements in this report 
financing transactions on april   we successfully completed the refinancing of our principal revolving credit facility revolving facility that was due to expire on july  borrowers under the revolving facility are graftech finance inc graftech finance and graftech switzerland sa swissco  both wholly owned subsidiaries 
as amended and restated  the credit agreement provides for  among other things  an extension until april  of the maturity of our revolving facility in the initial amount of million  additional flexibility for investments and acquisitions and  subject to certain conditions  an accordion feature that permits graftech finance and swissco to establish additional credit facilities thereunder in an aggregate amount  together with our revolving facility  of up to million 
we can have outstanding letters of credit of up to million under the revolving facility 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings of million and outstanding letters of credit of million under this revolving facility 
on november   in connection with the acquisitions  we issued two senior subordinated notes for an aggregate total face amount of million 
these senior subordinated notes are non interest bearing and mature in  see note acquisitions 
because the promissory notes are non interest bearing  we were required to record them at their present value determined using an interest rate of 
the difference between the face amount of the promissory notes and their present value is recorded as debt discount 
the debt discount will be amortized to income using the interest method  over the life of the promissory notes 
the loan balance  net of unamortized discount  was million at december  on september   we redeemed all of the remaining outstanding senior notes  million  at plus accrued interest 
total cash paid to redeem the balance of the senior notes approximated million 
during  we entered into a supply chain financing arrangement  as discussed in more detail under liquidity and capital resources  below 
our purchases of inventory under this arrangement were million in and million in on occasion we sell accounts receivable without recourse to a third party 
during we sold million of receivables 
we did not sell any receivables during see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion 
proceedings against us we are involved in various investigations  lawsuits  claims  demands  environmental compliance programs  labor disputes and other legal proceedings arising out of or incidental to the conduct of our business 
while it is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of each of these matters and proceedings  we do not believe that their ultimate disposition will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
there is litigation pending in brazil involving disputes arising out of the interpretation of certain collectively bargained wage increase provisions applicable in and to employers including our subsidiary in brazil in the bahia region of brazil 
we are not currently party to any of the litigation involving the interpretation of the wage increase provisions at issue  however  litigation is pending against other employers in the region and we have learned that several companies in brazil have recently settled claims arising out of these provisions 
while the most recent ruling on the subject by the supreme court of brazil has held that such provisions are not enforceable  and thus employers are not liable for the wage increases claimed on behalf of employees  further proceedings are pending seeking to reverse that ruling and there have been changes in the composition of the supreme court in the interim 
while we cannot predict the outcome of the pending proceedings  if the supreme court reverses its prior decision 
table of contents and declares the wage increase provisions enforceable  claims could be filed against our brazilian subsidiary which could become substantial 
realizability of net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances at december  we had million of gross deferred income tax assets  of which million required a valuation allowance 
in addition  we had million of gross deferred income tax liabilities 
our valuation allowance means that we do not believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized 
until we determine that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets  income tax benefits in each current period will be fully reserved 
our valuation allowance  which is predominately in the us tax jurisdiction  does not affect our ability and intent to utilize the deferred income tax assets as we generate sufficient future profitability 
we are executing current strategies and developing future strategies  to improve sales  reduce costs and improve our capital structure in order to improve us taxable income of the appropriate character to a level sufficient to fully realize these benefits in future years 
customer base we are a global company and sell our products in every major geographic market 
sales of these products to buyers outside the us accounted for about of net sales in  in  and in in  four of our ten largest customers were based in europe  two in the united states  two in south america  one in india and one in china 
in  nine of our ten largest customers were purchasers of our industrial materials products 
no single customer or group of affiliated customers accounted for more than of our net sales in results of operations and segment review for most of  companies across the world demonstrated  to varying degrees  a gradual recovery from the reduced production levels experienced during the global economic downturn 
in we achieved our second highest net sales in our engineered solutions segment in our company s history as demand for our products increased 
the graphite electrode restocking initiative  which began in the second half of continued throughout much of the year in our industrial materials segment 
further  eaf capacity utilization rates increased in on november   we consummated the acquisitions of seadrift  a needle coke supplier  and c g  a producer of graphite electrodes and related products  pursuant to the april  agreements and plans of merger  as described further in note  acquisitions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consideration paid to the former owners of seadrift and c g aggregated million and consisted of cash  shares of our common stock and two senior subordinated notes 
these businesses are now incorporated into our existing industrial materials segment 
with the acquisition of seadrift we have added another major product category  needle coke products  to the industrial materials segment 
the analysis below includes the results of operations for seadrift and c g for the month of december pursuant to the seadrift merger  we acquired from the equity holders of seadrift the of the equity interests in seadrift that we did not already own 
seadrift is one of the world s largest manufacturers of petroleum based needle coke and owns the world s only known stand alone petroleum based needle coke plant  located in port lavaca  texas 
in addition to calcined needle coke  the plant produces naphtha  gas oil and electricity as by products 
for further discussion on the acquisitions see note  acquisitions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for most of companies across the world experienced the deepest global downturn in recent history 
we weathered the economic recession despite declines in shipments in both our industrial materials and engineered solutions segments 
we remained profitable by adjusting our production to meet customer orders and aggressively controlling costs 
we used existing supplies of raw materials which allowed us to conserve cash and reduce our debt 
in september signs of a slow recovery in the steel industry began to emerge 
government stimulus programs around the world resulted in modest growth in 
table of contents several economies resulting in our customers replenishing inventories in order to meet slightly higher utilization rates for steel production 
in the second half of customers restocked their depleted inventories of graphite electrodes in order to meet increasing demand 
the world steel association estimates that worldwide steel production was about billion metric tons in  an decrease compared to china  which accounted for of the total  increased compared to non chinese steel production rose from an average of about million tons per month in the first few months of to about million tons per month by the end of while production levels rose in the last half of compared to the first half  they did not reach the levels of the first half of we believe that the worldwide total graphite electrode manufacturing capacity for was million metric tons and that the graphite electrode industry manufacturing capacity utilization rate worldwide was approximately for demand for our engineered solutions products decreased in as a result of the global recession 
we experienced lower sales volume across multiple product lines 
we expect our engineered solutions segment to begin to recover in the second half of global and regional economic conditions remained relatively stable in the first half of in september it became apparent that the global economy was entering into difficult times due to the financial industry crisis 
credit markets became frozen  liquidity diminished  business activity slowed at an extreme pace leading the global economy into its worst crisis in years 
due to the negative global economic situation and falling steel demand from key steel end markets automotive  construction  and appliances  a significant number of global steel producers reduced their operating rates in the fourth quarter 
we believe that in the graphite electrode markets in which we compete  the capacity utilization rate was over for the first nine months of due to the financial crisis and the global economic slowdown  however  operating rates fell dramatically in the fourth quarter of to an average of and were estimated to be approximately at year end the world steel association estimated that worldwide steel production was about billion metric tons in  about a decrease as compared to china s steel production grew at a much lower rate than in recent years due to a slowdown in economic growth and falling steel demand 
in  china s steel production grew by about  a significant decline compared to china s recent double digit annual growth rates 
steel production in the rest of the world declined by in the percent of eaf to total steel production remained at approximately in eaf steel production was estimated to have been million metric tons in  about a decrease compared to for the first nine months of the year  eaf production grew by over  but eaf experienced a decline of in the fourth quarter 
china s eaf steel production increased compared to the prior year 
the rest of the world s eaf production declined by  as a result of lower operating rates in the fourth quarter 
demand for our engineered solutions segment increased in as compared to the increases were mainly in the energy related markets  including solar  oil and gas exploration  transportation industries  and etm markets 
the tables presented in our year over year comparisons summarize our consolidated statements of income and illustrate key financial indicators used to assess the consolidated financial results 
financial information is presented for the years ended december    and throughout our md a  percentage changes that are both less than and less than million  are deemed to be not meaningful and are designated as nm

net sales by operating segment for the years ended december  and were in thousands  except per share data and change increase decrease change industrial materials engineered solutions total net sales we experienced higher sales for both of our operating segments as a result of the improved global economic conditions in our industrial materials operating segment benefitted from the restocking efforts of many of our customers  which began in the second half of and continued through  as well as the inclusion of seadrift and c g for the month of december our engineered solutions segment also saw benefits as a result of the recovering economy  as customers started the reordering process in response to increasing orders and production 
our analysis of the percentage change in net sales for industrial materials and engineered solutions is set forth in the following table volume price mix currency net change industrial materials engineered solutions 
table of contents net sales 
sales for the industrial materials segment increased significantly in when compared to due to higher graphite electrode sales volume 
partially offsetting this increased demand  we saw the weighted average selling price of our melter and non melter graphite electrodes decrease by approximately  exclusive of currency impacts  in when compared to higher period over period electrode sales volumes are expected to continue to mitigate  in part  the lower electrode pricing 
our engineered solutions segment also saw a significant increase in volumes in  offset slightly by an unfavorable price mix  and currency impacts 
cost of sales 
the primary drivers of the increase in cost of sales were increases in shipments of our products of million  production costs of million and unfavorable foreign currency impact of million  across both of our segments during when compared to the cost of sales also included the amortization expense related to the technology intangible asset acquired in the acquisitions of seadrift and c g of million 
the global recession led to a dramatic decline in the demand for  and corresponding production of  graphite electrodes during the first nine months of our production volume began increasing in the second half of and continued to increase in the first half of before leveling off in the second half of the year as our customers ramped up production from the low levels experienced during the first half of needle coke is the primary raw material in the manufacture of graphite electrodes 
we have traditionally purchased to of our needle coke requirements from one supplier under contracts with one year firm price per metric ton schedules 
our production in began to use higher cost needle coke purchased in the fourth quarter of  at prices which were approximately higher than the cost of needle coke used in production during the first nine months of the inventory flow through of the higher cost raw material has increased our cost of goods for when compared to higher volumes increased our fixed costs absorption in  partially offsetting the higher needle coke cost 
in recent years  we historically purchased a majority of our requirements for petroleum coke  our principal raw material  from two plants of conocophillips under supply agreements containing customary terms and conditions  including price renegotiation  dispute resolution and termination provisions 
the termination provisions permitted either party to terminate the agreements at the end of a calendar year by giving the other party notice of termination by september of that calendar year 
during the course of our annual discussions with conocophilips regarding our future needle coke requirements  including potential changes in such needs as a result of our then pending acquisition of seadrift  as well as other provisions of the agreements which had become inapplicable due to changes in circumstances over the decade since the agreements were first established  the consensus of the parties was that the agreements should be terminated and that the parties enter into negotiations concerning future supply of needle coke 
accordingly  the agreements were terminated effective as of december  and we have entered into three year supply agreements for the supply of needle coke 
we believe the estimated quantities under the replacement agreements will be sufficient for our forecast raw material requirements 
selling and administrative expenses 
acquisition costs ie  advisory  legal  valuation  other professional fees  etc 
associated with our acquisitions of seadrift and c g represented million in we also experienced higher overhead expense due to increases in sales and marketing coverage to support internal growth initiatives during when compared to other increases year over year related to our stock based compensation expense which increased million  commission expense related to increased sales of million and the amortization expense incurred related to the customer list and trade names intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions of seadrift and c g of million 
equity in losses earnings of  write down of investment in and gain recorded on acquisition of non consolidated affiliate 
we acquired an interest in seadrift on june   and subsequently acquired the remaining of the equity interests in seadrift on november  as a result of the acquisition of the remaining of the equity interests in seadrift  accounting guidance requires us to re measure the book value of our previously held equity interest at the 
table of contents acquisition date to fair value and recognize the resulting gain in our earnings 
we recorded a million non cash gain in our earnings 
our equity in earnings for was million as compared to equity in losses of million in additionally  in june  we performed an assessment of our investment for impairment and determined that the fair value of the investment was less than our carrying value and that the loss in value was other than temporary 
we recorded a million non cash impairment to recognize this other than temporary loss in value 
other income expense 
other income expense was income of million in  compared to an expense in of million  due in large part to favorable currency gains of million in compared to losses of million in interest expense 
interest expense decreased in as a result of the low long term debt levels carried through when compared to the debt levels maintained throughout we expect our interest expense to increase in due to higher draws on our revolving facility and the amortization of the discount recorded with the issuance of the senior subordinated notes 
segment operating income 
corporate expenses are allocated to segments based on each segment s percentage of consolidated sales 
the following table represents our operating income by segment for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  dollars in thousands industrial materials engineered solutions total segment operating income the percentage relationship of operating expenses to sales for industrial materials and engineered solutions is set forth in the following table operating expenses change percentage of sales industrial materials engineered solutions segment operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales for industrial materials remained consistent year over year 
however  total operating costs and expenses increased million year over year 
the increase was primarily a result of volume increases including the effect of the additional volume from the acquisitions of million  higher production costs of million  unfavorable currency exchange of million and acquisition costs incurred of million 
segment operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales for engineered solutions decreased three percentage points to in when compared to total operating costs and expenses  however  increased million year over year 
the increase was primarily a result of increases in volume of million which were offset by favorable currency of million 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was a benefit of million on pre tax income of million in  compared to a tax expense of million on pre tax income of million in the effective tax rates were and respectively 
the tax rate was negatively impacted primarily by an increase in the valuation allowance of million as a result of the impairment of our investment in seadrift and the establishment of accruals for uncertain tax positions of million 
as a result of our acquisitions  we are now in an overall net deferred tax liability position  and therefore  we reversed the provision for valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in the amount of million

net sales by operating segment for the years ended december  and were in thousands  except per share data and change increase decrease change industrial materials engineered solutions total net sales the global recession resulted in significantly reduced sales for both operating segments 
we experienced reduced demand across all of our products lines as our customers  especially those in the industrial materials segment  used existing inventory in response to their decreased orders and production 
in the second half of demand and shipments began to increase as customers began restocking their inventories in response to increasing orders and production 
our analysis of the percentage change in net sales for industrial materials and engineered solutions is set forth in the following table volume price mix currency net change industrial materials engineered solutions 
table of contents the sales decline was partially offset by year over year price realization 
cost of sales 
the primary driver of the reduction in cost of sales was reduced shipments of our products 
the global recession led to a dramatic decline in the demand for  and corresponding production of  graphite electrodes 
our customers aggressively managed their working capital by destocking their graphite electrode inventory supply which exacerbated the reduced demand for electrodes 
cost of sales was also negatively impacted due to the unfavorable fixed cost absorption associated with lower sales volume 
needle coke is the primary raw material in the manufacture of graphite electrodes 
we historically have purchased to of our needle coke requirements from one supplier under contracts with one year firm price per metric ton schedules 
our purchases of needle coke in were limited and abnormally low due to the lower production level of graphite electrodes 
due to the historically low production volumes  and proactive inventory management  essentially all of our production was produced with needle cost that was in inventory at december   and carried the purchase price per metric ton 
during the fourth quarter of we began to replenish our needle coke raw material inventory at the purchase price per metric ton  which was approximately higher than the purchase price per metric ton 
as of december  essentially all of this higher cost material was still in inventory and  therefore  our cost of goods sold does not reflect the impact of the increased needle coke per metric ton cost 
selling and administrative expenses 
lower sales commissions as a result of decreased sales and aggressive cost control contributed to the decrease in selling and administrative expenses 
the derecognition of our liability for brazilian excise taxes on manufactured goods resulted in a benefit of million and our stock based compensation expense decreased million 
equity in losses and write down of investment in non consolidated affiliate 
we acquired our initial investment in the non consolidated affiliate on june  our equity in losses for the year were million compared to in the increased losses were due in part to our recognizing our share of the investee losses for a full year as well as the effect of the recession on its operations 
in june  we performed an assessment of our investment for impairment and determined that the fair value of the investment was less than our carrying value and that the loss in value was other than temporary 
we recorded a million non cash impairment to recognize this other than temporary loss in value 
in december  we had recorded a million non cash impairment to recognize the other than temporary loss in value determined at that time 
given the current economic environment and the uncertainties surrounding the impact on steel producers and their suppliers  including our investee  there can be no assurances that our estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the investment will prove to be accurate 
if the assumptions regarding forecasted revenue  growth rates  and expected profitability are not achieved  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
other income expense 
other expense decreased in due in large part to the expenses that were recognized in for the derecognition of the debentures and the loss on extinguishment of debt 
in we had other expense related to currency compared to income related to currency in interest expense 
interest expense decreased in as a result of the derecognition of the debentures in and the redemption of all of the remaining outstanding senior notes in the third quarter of segment operating income 
corporate expenses are allocated to segments based on each segment s percentage of consolidated sales 
the following table represents our operating income by segment for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  dollars in thousands industrial materials engineered solutions total segment operating income 
table of contents the percentage relationship of operating expenses  including restructuring and impairment charges  to sales for industrial materials and engineered solutions is set forth in the following table operating expenses change percentage of sales industrial materials engineered solutions provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in was negatively impacted by an increase in the valuation allowance of and the establishment of accruals for uncertain tax positions of million 
this increase was offset in part by a million worthless stock deduction and by million for tax exemptions  holidays and credits in various non us jurisdictions 
eff ects of inflation we incur costs in the us and each of the six us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility 
in general  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are affected by the effects of inflation on our costs incurred in each of these countries 
currency translation and transactions we translate the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidation and reporting purposes in accordance with fasb asc  foreign currency matters 
foreign currency translation adjustments are generally recorded as part of stockholders equity and identified as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets until such time as their operations are sold or substantially or completely liquidated 
we account for our russian and mexican subsidiaries using the dollar as the functional currency  as sales and purchases are predominantly dollar denominated 
our remaining subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency 
we also record foreign currency transaction gains and losses from non permanent intercompany balances as part of other income expense  net 
significant changes in currency exchange rates impacting us are described under effects of changes in currency exchange rates and results of operations 
effects of changes in currency exchange rates when the currencies of non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility decline or increase in value relative to the us dollar  this has the effect of reducing or increasing the us dollar equivalent cost of sales and other expenses with respect to those facilities 
in certain countries where we have manufacturing facilities  and in certain instances where we price our products for sale in export markets  we sell in currencies other than the dollar 
accordingly  when these currencies increase or decline in value relative to the dollar  this has the effect of increasing or reducing net sales 
the result of these effects is to increase or decrease operating profit and net income 
many of the non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility have been subject to significant economic and political changes  which have significantly impacted currency exchange rates 
we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates in the future or whether those changes will have net positive or negative impacts on our net sales  cost of sales or net income 
during  the average exchange rates for the brazilian real and the south african rand increased significantly  about and  respectively  when compared to rates 
also during  the mexican peso and the japanese yen increased roughly  while the euro decreased about  as compared to rates 
during  the average exchange rate of the south african rand did not fluctuate materially  while the mexican peso  the brazilian real  and the euro average rates decreased about   and respectively as compared to rates 
for net sales of industrial materials  the impact of these events was an increase of million in  a decrease of million in  and a decrease of million in for the cost of industrial materials  the impact of these events was an increase of million in  an increase of million in  and an increase of million in we have had intercompany term loans between graftech finance and some of our foreign subsidiaries 
we had no such term loans at december  or 
table of contents at december   the aggregate principal amount of these term loans was million 
these loans were subject to remeasurement gains and losses due to changes in currency exchange rates 
certain of these loans had been deemed to be essentially permanent prior to settlement and  as a result  remeasurement gains and losses on these loans were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
the remaining balance of these loans was deemed to be temporary and  as a result  remeasurement gains and losses on these loans were recorded as currency gains losses in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statements of income 
as part of our cash management  we also have intercompany loans between our subsidiaries 
these loans are deemed to be temporary and  as a result  remeasurement gains and losses on these loans are recorded as currency gains losses in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statements of income 
we had net total of currency gains of million in  a net total currency loss of million in  and a net total currency gain of million in  mainly due to the remeasurement of intercompany loans and the effect of transaction gains and losses on intercompany activities 
we have in the past and may in the future use various financial instruments to manage certain exposures to specific financial market risks caused by changes in currency exchange rates  as described under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet all of our present needs 
future disruptions in the us and international financial markets  however  could adversely affect the cost and availability of financing to us in the future 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  long term debt of million and stockholders equity of  million 
we also had million available through our revolving facility 
as part of our cash management activities  we manage accounts receivable credit risk  collections  and accounts payable vendor terms to maximize our free cash at any given time and minimize accounts receivable losses 
we expend capital to support our operating and strategic plans 
such expenditures include investments to meet regulatory and environmental requirements  maintain capital assets  develop new products or improve existing products  acquisitions  and to enhance capacity or productivity 
many of the associated projects have long lead times and require commitments in advance of actual spending 
we are targeting capital expenditures to be in the million to million range for our sources of funds have consisted principally of cash flow from operations and debt  including our revolving facility 
our uses of those funds other than for operations have consisted principally of capital expenditures  cash paid for acquisitions and expenses thereof  our equity investment in a non consolidated affiliate  and debt reduction payments and other obligations 
as of december   we have several future obligations accrued that will utilize a significant amount of such funds 
these obligations include our employee incentive compensation payout of approximately million  which will be paid during the second quarter of we have an accounts receivable factoring arrangement in place that provides additional working capital liquidity of up to million 
during  certain subsidiaries sold receivables totaling million 
proceeds of the sale of receivables were used to reduce debt and fund operations 
if we had not sold such receivables  our accounts receivable would have been about million higher at december  all such receivables sold during were sold without recourse  and no amount of accounts receivable sold are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
we did not sell any receivables under this arrangement during lower sales volumes for our products and reduced credit quality of our customers may limit the amount of receivables that we sell in the future 
our current receivable sales facility provides for the sale of certain customer accounts receivable and has a limit of million 
the facility automatically renewed for a one 
table of contents year period on june   and it automatically renews each year thereafter for one year periods unless a termination notice is sent by either party days prior to the applicable june th 
during  we entered into a supply chain financing arrangement with a financing party that provides additional working capital liquidity of up to million 
under this arrangement  we essentially assigned our rights to purchase needle coke from a third party supplier to the financing party 
the financing party purchases the product from our supplier under the standard payment terms and then immediately resells it to us under longer payment terms 
the financing party pays the supplier the purchase price for the product and then we pay the financing party 
our payment for this needle coke will include a mark up the mark up 
the mark up is subject to quarterly reviews 
in effect  we have a longer period of time to pay the financing party than by purchasing directly from the supplier which helps us maintain a balanced cash conversion cycle between inventory payments and the collection of receivables 
we purchased approximately million and million of inventory under this arrangement in and  respectively 
in connection with these purchases  we incurred a mark up of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
this agreement is subject to termination days after notice is sent by either party 
the underlying supply agreements have been terminated and we have executed replacement supply agreements which we expect to add to the supply chain financing arrangement 
in the event that operating cash flow  the sales of receivables and the financing of needle coke purchases fail to provide sufficient liquidity to meet our business needs  including capital expenditures  any such shortfall would be made up by increased borrowings under our revolving facility 
we use cash flow from operations  funds from receivable and payable factoring arrangements and funds available under the revolving facility subject to continued compliance with the financial covenants and representations under the revolving facility as well as cash on hand as our primary sources of liquidity 
the revolving facility is secured  and provides for maximum borrowings of up to million including a letters of credit sub facility of up to million and  subject to certain conditions including a maximum senior secured leverage ratio test  an accordion feature that permits graftech finance to establish additional credit facilities thereunder in an aggregate amount  together with the revolving facility  of up to million 
the revolving facility matures in april on january   s p upgraded our corporate rating by two notches to bb and our senior secured debt rating to bbb 
on april   moody s investors services moved our rating outlook to positive from stable  assigned a ba rating to our new senior secured revolving credit facility  and affirmed our ba corporate rating 
these ratings reflect the current views of these rating agencies  and no assurance can be given that these ratings will continue for any given period of time 
however  we monitor our financial condition as well as market conditions that could ultimately affect our credit ratings 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants contained in the revolving facility  as applicable 
these covenants include maintaining an interest coverage ratio of at least to and a maximum net senior secured leverage ratio of to  subject to adjustment based on a rolling average of the prior four quarters 
based on expected operating results and expected cash flows  we expect to be in compliance with these covenants through maturity of our revolving facility 
if we were to believe that we would not continue to comply with these covenants  we would seek an appropriate waiver or amendment from the lenders thereunder 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such waiver or amendment on acceptable terms or at all 
eight banks are participants in our credit facility 
all of these eight banks currently have standard poor s s p ratings of bbb or better and moody s ratings of baa or better 
based on these ratings and the remaining term of the revolving facility  we do not anticipate that our availability under this facility would be reduced prior to its maturity 
at december   approximately of our debt consists of fixed rate or zero interest rate obligations compared to at december

our foreign subsidiaries have local lines of credit for working capital purposes 
the total amount available under these lines of credit approximated million at december  cash flow and plans to manage liquidity 
our business strategies include efforts to enhance our capital structure by further reducing our gross obligations to enable us to pursue strategic growth opportunities that may arise 
our efforts include leveraging our global manufacturing network by driving higher utilization rates and more productivity from our existing assets  accelerating commercialization initiatives across all of our businesses and realizing other global efficiencies 
typically  our cash flow from operations fluctuates significantly between quarters due to various factors 
these factors include customer order patterns  fluctuations in working capital requirements  and other factors 
we had positive cash flow from operations during   and although the global economic environment has experienced significant swings in these three years  our aggressive working capital management and cost control initiatives have allowed us to remain cash flow positive in both times of declining and improving operating results 
certain of our obligations could have a material impact on our liquidity 
cash flow from operations services payment of our obligations  including our incentive compensation program payout in the second quarter of  thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes 
although we currently have million of additional borrowing capacity under the revolving facility  continued improvement  or another downturn  in the global economy may require increased borrowings under our revolving facility  particularly if our accounts receivable and supply chain financing arrangements are terminated 
an improving economy  while resulting in improved results of operations and cash flows  could require significant cash requirements to purchase inventories and pay other obligations as 
table of contents accounts receivable increase 
a downturn could significantly negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows  which  coupled with increased borrowings  could negatively impact our credit ratings  our ability to comply with debt covenants  our ability to secure additional financing and the cost of such financing  if available 
based on expected operating results and expected cash flows  we expect to be in compliance with our existing financial covenants in in order to seek to minimize our credit risks  we reduce our sales of  or refuse to sell except for cash on delivery or under letters of credit  our products to some customers and potential customers 
in the current economic environment  our customers may experience liquidity shortages or difficulties in obtaining credit  including letters of credit 
our unrecovered trade receivables worldwide have not been material during the last years individually or in the aggregate 
we cannot assure you that we will not be materially adversely affected by accounts receivable losses in the future 
in addition  we have historically factored a portion of our accounts receivable and used the proceeds to reduce debt 
our ability to factor accounts receivable in the future may be limited by reduced credit ratings of customers or by a reduction in the amount permitted to be financed under the arrangement 
in december  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
share repurchases may take place from time to time in the open market  or through privately negotiated transactions  as market conditions warrant 
we intend to fund any such share repurchases from available cash and cash flows 
these share repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
off balance sheet arrangements and commitments 
we have not undertaken or been a party to any material off balance sheet financing arrangements or other commitments including non exchange traded contracts  other than foreign exchange and commodity contracts 
commitments under non cancelable operating leases that  at december   totaled no more than million in each year and about million in the aggregate  and at december   totaled no more than million in each year and about million in the aggregate

cash flows 
the following is a discussion of our cash flow activities years ended december  dollars in millions cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities cash flow from operating activities represents cash receipts and cash disbursements related to all our activities other than to investing and financing activities 
operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net income for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  write down of our investment in our non consolidated affiliate  stock based compensation charges  equity in losses of our non consolidated affiliate gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities such as gains and losses on the sale of assets and currency gains and losses changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations 
table of contents while our operating cash flow increased significantly in  it decreased by over million in mainly due to the decrease in net income which was a direct impact of the severe economic recession and other reasons noted throughout this md a 
during  although the global economy began to recover  our improved operating results were negatively impacted by increased inventory purchases and the build of accounts receivable as business ramped to near pre recessionary levels 
this resulted in a million decrease in operating cash flow  despite the improved economic operating environment 
the net impact of the changes in working capital operating assets and liabilities  which are discussed in more detail below  include the impact of changes in receivables  inventories  prepaid expenses  accounts payable  accrued liabilities  interest payable  and payments of other current liabilities 
we continue to maximize our operating cash flows by continuing to improve those working capital items that are most directly affected by changes in sales volume  such as accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable 
in  changes in working capital resulted in a net use of funds of million which was impacted by use of funds of million from the increase in accounts receivable  including the effect of factoring for million  which was due primarily to increased sales for the period  use of funds for inventories of million primarily due to the increased sales volume  and source of funds of million from an increase in accounts payable and accruals through normal operations and inventory purchases 
other items that affected our operating cash flow included cash outflows of million for contributions to pension and post retirement plans  and million of customary acquisition related expenses 
in  changes in working capital resulted in a net source of funds of million which was impacted by cash inflows from a million decrease in accounts receivable  net of factoring of million  which was primarily attributable to decreased sales  credit risk policies  and cash collection efforts  cash inflows of million from the reduction of inventories which was primarily due to decreased purchases of raw materials as a result of decreased sales  and cash outflows of million for accounts payable due to the decrease in inventory purchases and the timing of payments 
other items that affected our operating cash flow included cash inflows from federal income tax refunds of million  cash outflows of million to settle our liability for brazil excise tax  cash outflows of million for our contributions to pension and post retirement plans  cash outflows of million to restore wage reductions instituted in  and cash outflows of million to terminate an information technology outsourcing services contract

table of contents costs relating to protection of the environment we have been and are subject to increasingly stringent environmental protection laws and regulations 
in addition  we have an on going commitment to rigorous internal environmental protection standards 
environmental considerations are part of all significant capital expenditure decisions 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding environmental expenses and capital expenditures 
years ended december  dollars in thousands expenses relating to environmental protection capital expenditures related to environmental protection critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that require difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note business and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following accounting policies are deemed to be critical 
business combinations and goodwill 
the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill 
our estimates of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable  and when appropriate  include assistance from independent third party appraisal firms 
as a result of our acquisitions of seadrift coke lp and c g electrodes llc  we have a significant amount of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstances indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this requires us to use significant judgment including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term growth for our business  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  determination of our weighted average cost of capital for purposes of establishing discount rate and relevant market data 
our annual impairment test of goodwill was performed in the fourth quarter 
the estimated fair values of our reporting units were based on discounted cash flow models derived from internal earnings forecasts and assumptions 
the assumptions and estimates used in these valuations incorporated the current economic environment in performing our impairment test 
our model was based on our internally developed forecast for  then adding a growth to each subsequent year in the model 
we believe these estimated assumptions are appropriate for our circumstances  including our historical results  consistent with our forecasted long term business model and give consideration to the current economic environment 
based on these valuations  we determined that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and no goodwill impairment charge was required during the fourth quarter refer to note business and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our goodwill impairment testing 
reliance on estimates 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  we use and rely on estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  obligations under our employee benefit plans  provisions for doubtful accounts  provisions for restructuring charges and contingencies  tax valuation allowances  evaluation of goodwill  our investment in a 
table of contents non consolidated affiliate and other intangible assets  pension and postretirement benefit obligations and various other recorded or disclosed amounts  including inventory valuations 
estimates require us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our estimates for these matters are reasonable  if the actual amount is significantly different than the estimated amount  our assets  liabilities or results of operations may be overstated or understated 
employee benefit plans 
we sponsor various retirement and pension plans  including defined benefit and defined contribution plans and postretirement benefit plans that cover most employees worldwide 
excluding the defined contribution plans  accounting for these plans requires assumptions as to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  expected salary increases and health care cost trend rate 
see note retirement plans and postretirement benefits of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
contingencies 
we account for contingencies by recording an estimated loss when information available prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as those relating to environmental  legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss is significantly different from the estimated loss  our results of operations may be overstated or understated 
legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are expensed as incurred 
investments in non consolidated affiliates 
we use the equity method to account for investments in entities that we do not control  but where we have the ability to exercise significant influence 
impairments of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the future undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
estimates of the future cash flows are subject to significant uncertainties and assumptions 
if the actual value is significantly less than the estimated fair value  our assets may be overstated 
future events and circumstances  some of which are described below  may result in an impairment charge new technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over our current technology  significant negative economic or industry trends  changes in our business strategy that alter the expected usage of the related assets  and future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments 
accounting for income taxes 
when we prepare the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to make the following assessments estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction  estimate our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that we include within the consolidated balance sheets  and assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  if we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established 
if our estimates are incorrect  our deferred tax assets or liabilities may be overstated or understated 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of our products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an 
table of contents arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  title has passed  the amount is determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
sales are recognized when both title and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer or services have been rendered and fees have been earned in accordance with the contract 
volume discounts and rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue in conjunction with the sale of the related products 
changes to estimates are recorded when they become probable 
shipping and handling revenues relating to products sold are included as an increase to revenue 
shipping and handling costs related to products sold are included as an increase to cost of sales 
stock based compensation plans 
stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date  based on the fair market value of the award and recognized over the requisite service period 
the fair value of restricted stock is based on the trading price of our common stock on the date of grant  less required adjustments to reflect dividends paid and expected forfeitures or cancellations of awards throughout the vesting period  which ranges between one and three years 
our stock option compensation expense calculated under the fair value method  using a black scholes model  is recognized over the vesting period  which ranges between one and three years 
recent accounting pronouncements we discuss recently adopted and issued accounting standards in note business and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
description of our financing structure we discuss our financing structure in more detail in note long term debt and liquidity of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  energy commodity prices and commercial energy rates 
we  from time to time  routinely enter into various transactions that have been authorized according to documented policies and procedures to manage these well defined risks 
these transactions relate primarily to financial instruments described below 
since the counterparties  if any  to these financial instruments are large commercial banks and similar financial institutions  we do not believe that we are exposed to material counterparty credit risk 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
our exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from floating rate long term debt tied to libor or euro libor 
our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates results primarily from sales made by our subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies  raw material purchases made by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies  and investments in and intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries and our share of the earnings of those subsidiaries  to the extent denominated in currencies other than the dollar 
our exposure to changes in energy costs results primarily from the purchase or sale of refined oil products  and the purchase of natural gas and electricity for use in our manufacturing operations 
interest rate risk management 
we periodically implement interest rate management initiatives to seek to minimize our interest expense and the risk in our portfolio of fixed and variable interest rate obligations 
we periodically enter into agreements with financial institutions that are intended to limit  or cap  our exposure to incurrence of additional interest expense due to increases in variable interest rates 
these instruments effectively cap our interest rate exposure 

table of contents currency rate management 
we enter into foreign currency derivatives from time to time to attempt to manage exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
these foreign currency derivatives  which include  but are not limited to  forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options  attempt to hedge global currency exposures  net  relating to non dollar denominated debt and identifiable foreign currency receivables  payables and commitments held by our foreign and domestic subsidiaries 
forward exchange contracts are agreements to exchange different currencies at a specified future date and at a specified rate 
purchased foreign currency options are instruments which give the holder the right  but not the obligation  to exchange different currencies at a specified rate at a specified date or over a range of specified dates 
forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options are carried at market value 
the outstanding foreign currency derivatives at december  and represented a net unrealized loss of million and a net unrealized gain of million  respectively 
energy commodity management 
we periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts and short duration fixed rate purchase contracts to effectively fix some or all of our natural gas  and refined oil product exposure 
the outstanding contracts at december  and represented net unrealized gains of million and million  respectively 
sensitivity analysis 
we used a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential effect of changes in currency exchange rates on gross margin and changes in interest rates on interest expense 
based on this analysis  a hypothetical weakening or strengthening in the dollar across all other currencies would have changed our reported gross margin for by approximately million 
based on this analysis  a hypothetical increase in interest rates of  basis points would have increased our interest expense by million for the year ended december
