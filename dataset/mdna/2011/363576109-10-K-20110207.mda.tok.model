item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item of this annual report 
we are engaged in providing insurance brokerage and third party property casualty claims settlement and administration services to entities in the united states and abroad 
we believe that one of our major strengths is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to our clients 
our brokers  agents and administrators act as intermediaries between insurers and their customers and we do not assume underwriting risks 
we are headquartered in itasca  illinois  have operations in countries and do business in more than countries globally through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants 
we generate approximately of our revenues domestically  with the remaining derived in australia  bermuda  canada  new zealand and the uk we have three reportable operating segments brokerage  risk management and corporate  which contributed approximately  and  respectively  to revenues 
our major sources of operating revenues are commissions  fees and supplemental and contingent commissions from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations 
investment income is generated from our investment portfolio  which includes invested cash and fiduciary funds  as well as clean energy investments and venture capital funds 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain statements relating to future results which are forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of please see information concerning forward looking statements in part i of this annual report  for certain cautionary information regarding forward looking statements and a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forward looking statements 
financial highlights the economic downturn continued to provide significant headwinds for our business in as a result  organic revenue declined in both our brokerage and risk management segments 
for our brokerage segment  organic commissions  fees and supplemental commissions defined below declined  and for our risk management segment  organic fees declined 
despite the difficult operating environment  we grew brokerage segment revenues by and risk management segment revenues by 
earnings from continuing operations were up for our brokerage segment and for our risk management segment  while adjusted ebitdac margin defined below held steady at for our brokerage segment and for our risk management segment 
we achieved these results by demonstrating expense discipline and headcount control while continuing to pursue our acquisition strategy 
during  we closed acquisitions in our brokerage segment  representing million in annualized acquired revenues 
we also completed a meaningful acquisition in our risk management segment  representing million in annualized acquired revenues 
in  we continued to grow our international operations through acquisitions 
by the end of  of our revenues were generated internationally  compared with in we expect this trend to continue in insurance market overview fluctuations in premiums charged by property casualty insurance carriers have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry 
commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels 
insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions 
various factors  including competition for market share among insurance carriers  increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations  can result in flat or reduced property casualty premium rates a soft market 
a soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues 
various countervailing factors  such as greater than anticipated loss experience and capital shortages  can result in increasing property casualty premium rates a hard market 
a hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues 
hard and soft markets may be broad based or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas 
as markets harden  certain insureds  who are the buyers of insurance our brokerage clients  have historically resisted paying increased premiums and the higher commissions these premiums generate 
such resistance often causes some buyers to raise their deductibles and or reduce the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase 
as the market softens  or costs decrease  these trends have historically reversed 
during a hard market  buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate us for placing their risks  or may consider the alternative insurance market  which includes self insurance  captives  rent a captives  risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk 
according to industry estimates  these mechanisms now account for of the total us commercial property casualty market 
our brokerage units are very active in these markets as well 
while increased use by insureds of these alternative markets historically has reduced commission revenue to us  such trends generally have been accompanied by new sales and renewal increases in the areas of risk management  claims management  captive insurance and self insurance services and related growth in fee revenue 

table of contents inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures  resulting in higher overall premiums and higher commissions 
however  the impact of hard and soft market fluctuations historically has had a greater impact on changes in premium rates  and therefore on our revenues  than inflationary pressures 
beginning in and continuing throughout  the property casualty insurance market has been operating in a relatively soft market in most lines and in most geographic areas 
for example  surveys by the council of insurance agents brokers which we refer to as the ciab indicated that commercial property casualty rates fell during first  second and third quarters of the average premium decline for all commercial accounts  regardless of size  was for first quarter  for second quarter and for third quarter 
a similar survey by the ciab indicated that commercial property casualty rates fell again during fourth quarter by an average of for all commercial accounts  regardless of size 
strong competition for new business among property casualty insurance carriers attempting to increase market share in a weak economy continued the downward pressure on rates 
in addition  insureds also added to the downward pressure on rates in the quarter as they negotiated to get the best terms and rates from the property casualty insurance carriers 
the ciab does not expect to see pricing turn upward until demand picks up and capacity in the market place diminishes 
the ciab represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers  who write approximately of the commercial property casualty premiums in the united states 
recent events the deterioration in the economy that began in the fall of adversely impacted us in  and could continue to do so in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in  among other things  their headcount  payroll  properties and the market value of their assets 
such reductions could also adversely impact our commission revenues in future years when the property casualty insurance carriers perform exposure audits and if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments 
we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and  as a result  any improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy 
in addition  some of our clients may cease operations completely in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy 
during march  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act which we refer to together as the health care reform legislation were signed into law 
the health care reform legislation  among other things  increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their employees 
many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and  therefore  are impacted by the health care reform legislation 
as a result  the potential exists for our employee benefits consultants to win new clients and generate additional revenue from existing clients by assisting them in navigating the increasingly complex regulations surrounding their benefits plans 
in  our employee benefits consulting operation generated approximately one quarter of the brokerage segment s revenues 
although we believe that the health care reform legislation could be beneficial to our brokerage segment s fee revenues  given the legislation s broad scope and the uncertainties that exist regarding the interpretation and implementation of many of the legislation s complex provisions  at this time the potential impact of the legislation on us  beneficial or otherwise  is uncertain 
we own positions in eight commercial clean coal operations 
we own approximately of six of these operations 
during most of the first nine months of  these six operations produced refined coal under temporary regulatory operating permits 
as planned  these operations curtailed most production in fourth quarter to perform testing routines in connection with applying for permanent regulatory operating permits 
in january  one of the six operations received its permanent regulatory operating permit 
we cannot predict when the permanent operating permits will be issued for the remaining five operations 
if these six operations receive permanent permits and operate at historical levels  they could generate up to to million of quarterly net earnings through in addition  we own of the other two operations  which as planned  did not produce refined coal in fourth quarter while we were seeking operating sites and potential co investors for these operations 
we are currently in negotiations for these two operations 
although we expect to have them in production by third or fourth quarter of  we cannot predict with certainty when the negotiations will be complete  when sites will be secured or when permanent operating permits will be issued 
if these two operations are running at planned levels  they could generate up to to million of quarterly net earnings through however  our ability to recoup these clean coal investments and generate net earnings on them is subject to significant risks and uncertainties relating to  among other things  our utility partners ability to obtain permanent permits  the facilities compliance with irc section  possible future changes in regulations  utilities use of coal to produce electricity  the operations of the facilities  our co investors and operational partners  and the defense of their intellectual property 
please see the risk factor regarding our irc section facilities under item a  risk factors  for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties 

table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize commission revenues at the later of the billing or the effective date of the related insurance policies  net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations 
we recognize commission revenues related to installment premiums as the installments are billed 
we recognize supplemental commission revenues using internal data and information received from insurance carriers that allows us to reasonably estimate the supplemental commissions earned in the period 
a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid  is determined by the insurance carrier based on historical performance criteria and is established annually in advance of the contractual period 
we recognize contingent commissions and commissions on premiums directly billed by insurance carriers as revenue when we have obtained the data necessary to reasonably determine such amounts 
typically  we cannot reasonably determine these types of commission revenues until we have received the cash or the related policy detail or other carrier specific information from the insurance carrier 
a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit and or volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period 
commissions on premiums billed directly by insurance carriers to the insureds generally relate to a large number of property casualty transactions  each with small premiums  and comprise a substantial portion of the revenues generated by our employee benefit operations 
under these direct bill arrangements  the insurance carrier controls the entire billing and policy issuance process 
we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known 
fee revenues generated from the brokerage segment primarily relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions  which we recognize in the same manner as commission revenues 
fee revenues generated from the risk management segment relate to third party claims administration  loss control and other risk management consulting services  which we provide over a period of time  typically one year 
we recognize these fee revenues ratably as the services are rendered  and record the income effects of subsequent fee adjustments when the adjustments become known 
premiums and fees receivable in our consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations and doubtful accounts 
we establish the allowance for estimated policy cancellations through a charge to revenues and the allowance for doubtful accounts through a charge to other operating expenses 
both of these allowances are based on estimates and assumptions using historical data to project future experience 
such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein 
we periodically review the adequacy of these allowances and make adjustments as necessary 
income taxes our tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates applicable to our taxable earnings and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions 
we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we evaluate our tax positions using a two step process 
the first step involves recognition 
we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the position 
the technical merits of a tax position are derived from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  we do not recognize the benefit of that position in the financial statements 
the second step is measurement 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of greater than of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 
uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment 
subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition  derecognition and measurement 
adjustments may result  for example  upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities  or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the possibility that our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may decrease within the next twelve months 
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than such items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the annual tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings is different than that reported in the tax returns 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns  and some differences are temporary and reverse over time  such as depreciation expense and amortization expense deductible for income tax purposes 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which a tax payment has been deferred  or expense which has been deducted in the tax return but has not yet been recognized in the financial statements 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements 

table of contents we establish or adjust valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in a specific jurisdiction 
in assessing the need for the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence as part of our analysis 
negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years 
positive evidence includes the forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction  tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years 
the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account our recent performance 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible or creditable 
intangible assets earnout obligations intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net tangible assets of acquired businesses 
we classify our intangible assets as either goodwill  expiration lists or non compete agreements 
expiration lists and non compete agreements are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives three to fifteen years for expiration lists and three to five years for non compete agreements  while goodwill is not subject to amortization 
allocation of intangible assets between goodwill  expiration lists and non compete agreements and the determination of estimated useful lives are based on valuations we receive from qualified independent appraisers 
the calculations of these amounts are based on estimates and assumptions using historical and pro forma data and recognized valuation methods 
different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 
we carry intangible assets at cost  less accumulated amortization in our consolidated balance sheet 
we review all of our intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we perform these impairment reviews at the reporting unit level with respect to goodwill and at the business unit level for amortizable intangible assets 
in reviewing intangible assets  if the fair value were less than the carrying amount of the respective or underlying asset  an indicator of impairment would exist and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings 
based on the results of impairment reviews in and  we wrote off million and million  respectively  of amortizable intangible assets related to brokerage segment acquisitions 
no such indicators were noted in the determinations of impairment indicators and fair value are based on estimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates 
different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 
effective january   we adopted on a prospective basis revised guidance to account for our acquisitions  which includes the estimation and recognition of the fair value of liabilities related to potential earnout obligations as of the acquisition dates for all of our acquisitions from and into the future  whose purchase agreements contain such provisions 
subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations are recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred 
potential earnout obligations are typically based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired businesses 
for acquisitions made prior to january   we did not include such obligations in the purchase price recorded for each applicable acquisition at the acquisition date because such obligations are not fixed and determinable 
we generally record future payments made under these and prior arrangements  if any  as additional goodwill when the earnouts are settled  which will have no impact on the amounts reported in our consolidated statement of earnings 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our business combinations 
historically  we have not incurred a material amount of external transaction costs related to our acquisitions 
however  when we have incurred such costs  we have capitalized these costs as part of our purchase accounting 
effective january   we expense all external transaction costs related to our acquisitions as incurred 
business combinations and dispositions see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our business combinations 
we did not have any material dispositions in or historically  we have used acquisitions to grow our brokerage segment s commission and fee revenues 
acquisitions allow us to expand into desirable geographic locations and further extend our presence in the retail and wholesale insurance brokerage services industries 
we expect that our brokerage segment s commission and fee revenues will continue to grow from acquisitions 
we intend to continue to consider from time to time  additional acquisitions for our brokerage and risk management segments on terms that we deem advantageous 
at any particular time  we generally will be engaged in discussions with multiple acquisition candidates 
however  we can make no assurances that any additional acquisitions will be consummated  or  if consummated  that they will be advantageous to us 

table of contents results of operations information regarding non gaap measures in the discussion that follows regarding our results of operations  we provide information regarding ebitdac  ebitdac margin  adjusted ebitdac  adjusted ebitdac margin  and organic change in commission  fee and supplemental commission revenues 
these measures are not in accordance with  or an alternative to  the gaap information provided in this annual report 
we believe that these presentations provide useful information to management  analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our results of operations and financial condition 
our industry peers provide similar supplemental non gaap information  although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments 
the non gaap information we provide should be used in addition to  but not as a substitute for  the gaap information provided 
certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year amounts reported in the annual report in order to conform them to the current year presentation 
earnings measures we believe that the presentation of ebitdac  ebitdac margin  adjusted ebitdac and adjusted ebitdac margin provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance 
we consider ebitdac and ebitdac margin as a way to measure financial performance on an ongoing basis 
adjusted ebitdac and adjusted ebitdac margin are meant to reflect the true operating performance of our business  consequently  they exclude items that could be considered non operating or non core in nature 
ebitdac we define this measure as earnings from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables 
ebitdac margin we define this measure as ebitdac divided by total revenues 
adjusted ebitdac we define this measure as ebitdac adjusted to exclude gains realized from sales of books of business  supplemental commission timing amounts  workforce related charges  lease termination related charges  litigation settlement amounts and the period over period impact of foreign currency translation 
the amounts excluded with respect to foreign currency translation are calculated by applying the current year foreign exchange rates to the same prior year periods 
adjusted ebitdac margin we define this measure as adjusted ebitdac divided by total revenues  as adjusted to exclude gains realized from sales of books of business and supplemental commission timing amounts 
organic revenues organic change in commission  fee and supplemental commission revenues excludes the first twelve months of net commission  fee and supplemental commission revenues generated from acquisitions accounted for as purchases and the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented 
these commissions and fees are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine the revenue growth that is associated with the operations that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year 
in addition  organic growth excludes the impact of contingent commission revenues and the period over period impact of foreign currency translation 
the amounts excluded with respect to foreign currency translation are calculated by applying foreign exchange rates to the same periods in these revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that will be continuing in and beyond 
management has historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our brokerage and risk management segments 
management also believes that using this measure allows financial statement users to measure  analyze and compare the growth from our brokerage and risk management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner 
reconciliation of non gaap information presented to gaap measure this annual report includes tabular reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures for each of ebitdac  adjusted ebitdac  adjusted ebitdac margin and organic change in commission  fee and supplemental commission revenues 
other information allocations of investment income and certain expenses are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates primarily using revenue  headcount and other information 
we allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments as if those segments were computing income tax provisions on a separate company basis 
as a result  the provision for income taxes for the corporate segment reflects the entire benefit to us of the irc section credits generated in  because that is the segment which produced the credits 
the law that provides for irc section credits expires on december  for our related investments 
we anticipate reporting an effective tax rate of approximately to in both our brokerage segment and our risk management segment for the foreseeable future 
reported operating results by segment would change if different allocation methods were applied 
in the discussion that follows regarding our results of operations  we also provide the following ratios with respect to our operating results pretax profit margin  compensation expense ratio and operating expense ratio 
pretax profit margin represents pretax earnings from continuing operations divided by total revenues 
the compensation expense ratio is compensation expense divided by total revenues 
the operating expense ratio is operating expense divided by total revenues 

table of contents brokerage segment the brokerage segment accounted for of our revenue from continuing operations in our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale brokerage operations 
our retail brokerage operations negotiate and place property casualty  employer provided health and welfare insurance and retirement solutions  principally for middle market commercial  industrial  public entity  religious and not for profit entities 
many of our retail brokerage customers choose to place their insurance with insurance underwriters  while others choose to use alternative vehicles such as self insurance pools  risk retention groups or captive insurance companies 
our wholesale brokerage operations assist our brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and agents in the placement of specialized  unique and hard to place insurance programs 
our primary sources of compensation for our retail brokerage services are commissions paid by insurance companies  which are usually based on a percentage of the premium paid by insureds and brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by our clients 
for wholesale brokerage services  we generally receive a share of the commission paid to the retail broker from the insurer 
commission rates depend on a number of factors  including the type of insurance  the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether we act as a retail or wholesale broker 
advisory fees depend on the extent and value of the services we provide 
in addition  under certain circumstances  both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent commissions 
a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid  is determined by the insurance carrier and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria 
a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit and or volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period

table of contents supplemental and contingent commissions reported supplemental and contingent commission revenues recognized in  and by quarter are shown in the table below 
as we have previously disclosed  many insurance carriers now provide sufficient information for us to recognize supplemental commission revenues on a quarterly basis for a majority of our supplemental commission arrangements 
however  in and prior years  most carriers only provided this information on an annual basis after the end of the contract period 
accordingly  the amounts reported in the table below include both a full year of supplemental commission revenues and supplemental commission revenues that were recognized by us on a quarterly basis 
this situation is not expected to occur again in and later years as we anticipate that most of the carriers will continue to provide information on a quarterly basis sufficient to allow us to recognize revenues in a similar manner in future quarters 
we expect to recognize a total of approximately million to million of supplemental commission revenues in each quarter of  assuming that the current market conditions continue in those future quarters 
to assist in comparing to  the supplemental commission timing line in the organic revenue tables above adjusts the revenue as if we had been receiving the information from the carriers and recognizing the quarterly supplemental commissions in on the same basis as in in order to estimate the quarterly information for and as if it would have been reported by the carriers  we allocated the annual amounts received from the carriers after the contract period to each quarter in the annual period on a straight line pro rata basis

table of contents risk management segment the risk management segment accounted for of our revenue from continuing operations in the risk management segment provides contract claim settlement and administration services for enterprises that choose to self insure some or all of their property casualty coverages and for insurance companies that choose to outsource some or all of their property casualty claims departments 
in addition  this segment generates revenues from integrated disability management programs  information services  risk control consulting loss control services and appraisal services  either individually or in combination with arising claims 
revenues for risk management services are substantially in the form of fees that are generally negotiated in advance on a per claim or per service basis  depending upon the type and estimated volume of the services to be performed

reconciliation of ebitdac the following provides a reconciliation of ebitdac to the most directly comparable gaap measure for  and in millions loss from continuing operations benefit for income taxes interest depreciation total ebitdac clean energy operations we own positions in eight commercial clean coal operations 
we own approximately of six of these operations 
during most of the first nine months of  these six operations produced refined coal under temporary regulatory operating permits 
as planned  these operations curtailed most production in fourth quarter to perform testing routines in connection with applying for permanent regulatory operating permits 
in january  one of the six operations received its permanent regulatory operating permit 
we cannot predict when the permanent operating permits will be issued for the remaining five operations 
if these six operations receive permanent permits and operate at historical levels  they could generate up to to million of quarterly net earnings through 
table of contents in addition  we own of the other two operations  which as planned  did not produce refined coal in fourth quarter while we were seeking operating sites and potential co investors for these operations 
we are currently in negotiations for these two operations 
although we expect to have them in production by third or fourth quarter of  we cannot predict with certainty when the negotiations will be complete  when sites will be secured or when permanent operating permits will be issued 
if these two operations are running at planned levels  they could generate up to to million of quarterly net earnings through chem mod is in the early stages of commercializing and marketing its chem mod solution technologies to their principal customers  coal fired power plants owned by utility companies  including those utilities that are operating with the clean coal production facilities that we built 
our ability to recoup clean coal related investments and generate earnings is subject to significant risk and uncertainties relating to  among other things  our utility partners ability to obtain long term permits  the facilities compliance with irc section  possible future changes in regulations  the utilities use of coal to produce electricity  the operations of the facilities  our co investors and operation partners  and the defense of their intellectual property 
also  while we believe that refined coal production at the clean coal production operations using the chem mod solution will qualify for tax credits under irc section  we can make no assurances that the production will continue to meet the requirements of irc section see note to the consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations in fourth quarter  we made a determination to exit our global reinsurance operations and our irish wholesale brokerage operations 
in first quarter  we signed definitive agreements to sell substantially all of our reinsurance brokerage business 
under the agreements  we received proceeds of million and potential additional proceeds of up to million 
in first quarter  we signed and closed a definitive agreement to sell all of the remaining run off obligations of our us reinsurance brokerage operations 
under the agreement  we transferred restricted cash of million  receivables of million and liabilities of million to the buyer 
we recorded million in lease termination and other real estate costs in while winding down the remaining leased facilities of the reinsurance brokerage operations 
in addition  we wrote off million in receivables in related to the potential additional contingent proceeds from the initial sale transactions that were recognized in as part of integrating the operations of a london based insurance brokerage firm acquired by us on april  and other real estate consolidation initiatives  we restored into service certain leased real estate space that was abandoned in as part of the wind down of certain of our discontinued operations 
we recognized million of pretax earnings from discontinued operations in primarily related to the reversal of a portion of the lease abandonment charges incurred in due to the irs completing its examination of our and tax years in fourth quarter  we also recognized million of previously unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes related to discontinued operations 
financial condition and liquidity liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations 
the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive 
historically  our capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on our common stock  repurchases of our common stock  funding of our investments  acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures 
cash flows from operating activities historically  we have depended on our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet our cash requirements 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
however  to fund acquisitions made during  we relied to a large extent on proceeds from borrowings  which were repaid before the end of fourth quarter  under a previous credit agreement 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to timing differences between periods related to cash collections of premiums and fees receivable and cash disbursements of premiums payable and improved operating results in compared to the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to decreases in incentive compensation payments and income tax payments 
our cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from our earnings from operations  as adjusted for realized gains and losses  and our non cash expenses  which include depreciation  amortization  changes in estimated acquisition earnout payables  deferred compensation  restricted stock  and stock based and other noncash compensation expenses 

table of contents when assessing our overall liquidity  we believe that the focus should be on earnings from continuing operations  adjusted for non cash items  in our consolidated statement of earnings and cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
we believe that these items are indicators of trends in liquidity 
from a balance sheet perspective  the focus should not be on premiums and fees receivable  premiums payable or restricted cash for trends in liquidity 
net cash flows provided by operations will vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year because of the variability in the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable 
we believe that in order to consider these items in assessing our trends in liquidity  they should be looked at in a combined manner  because changes in these balances are interrelated and are based on the timing of premium payments  both to and from us 
in addition  funds legally restricted as to our use relating to premiums and clients claim funds held as fiduciary funds  are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash and have not been included in determining our overall liquidity 
our policy for funding our defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the irc 
the employee retirement security act of  as amended which we refer to as erisa  currently imposes a minimum funding requirement for our plan  which is million for the minimum funding requirement under the irc was million for the plan s actuaries determine contribution rates based on our funding practices and requirements 
funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance  the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and or liabilities of the plan 
in addition  amounts funded in the future  to the extent not due under regulatory requirements  may be affected by alternative uses of our cash flows  including dividends  acquisitions and common stock repurchases 
during  we made discretionary contributions of million to the plan 
we are considering making additional discretionary contributions to the plan in and may be required to make minimum contributions to the plan in future periods 
we recognize in our consolidated balance sheet an asset for our defined benefit postretirement plans overfunded status or a liability for our plans underfunded status 
we recognize changes in the funded status of our defined benefit postretirement plans in comprehensive earnings in the year in which the changes occur 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for additional information required to be disclosed relating to our defined benefit postretirement plans 
we are required to recognize an accrued benefit plan liability for our underfunded defined benefit pension and unfunded retiree medical plans which we refer to together as the plans 
the offsetting adjustment to the liabilities required to be recognized for the plans is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss  net of tax  in our consolidated balance sheet 
we will recognize subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans through the income statement and as a component of comprehensive earnings  as appropriate  in the year in which they occur 
numerous items may lead to a change in funded status of the plans  including actual results differing from prior estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates 
in  the funded status of the plans was significantly impacted by an increase in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december   reflecting an increase in credit costs on high quality corporate debt obligations  and negative investment returns 
the change in funded status of the plans resulted in a reduction in noncurrent assets of million and an increase in noncurrent liabilities of million  including a related adjustment to tax benefits of million and a reduction of our stockholders equity of million in in  the funded status of the plans significantly improved primarily due to favorable investment returns 
the change in funded status of the plans resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities of million  including a related adjustment to tax benefits of million and an increase of our stockholders equity of million in in  the funded status of the plans improved primarily due to favorable investment returns  partially offset by a decrease in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december  the change in funded status of the plans resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities of million 
while the change in funded status of the plans had no impact on our cash flows from operations in  or  changes in the pension regulatory environment and investment losses in our pension plan have an effect on our capital position and could require us to make significant contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and increase our pension expense in future periods 
cash flows from investing activities capital expenditures net capital expenditures were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in  we expect total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately million  primarily related to office moves and expansions and updating computer systems and equipment 
the increase in net capital expenditures in from primarily related to capitalized costs associated with the implementation of new accounting and financial reporting systems and several other system initiatives that occurred in acquisitions cash paid for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decreased use of cash for acquisitions made in and compared to was primarily due to the decrease in the number of acquisitions made and the increased use of our common stock to complete acquisitions 
we completed  and acquisitions in  and  respectively 
annualized revenues of entities acquired in  and totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents during  we issued million shares of our common stock  paid million in cash and accrued million in liabilities related to earnout obligations of acquisitions made prior to and recorded additional goodwill of million 
during  we issued million shares of our common stock  paid million in cash and accrued million in liabilities related to earnout obligations of acquisitions made prior to and recorded additional goodwill of million 
during  we also issued million shares of our common stock related to an acquisition made in december and recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of december  during  we issued  shares of our common stock  paid million in cash and accrued million in liabilities related to earnout obligations of acquisitions made prior to and recorded additional goodwill of million 
dispositions during  we signed definitive agreements to sell substantially all of our reinsurance brokerage business 
under the agreements  we received initial proceeds of million and potential additional proceeds of up to million 
in first quarter  we signed and closed a definitive agreement to sell all of the remaining run off obligations of our us reinsurance brokerage operations 
under the agreement  we transferred restricted cash of million  receivables of million and liabilities of million to the buyer 
during  and  we sold several books of business and recognized one time gains of million  million and million  respectively  which approximated the cash proceeds we received related to these transactions 
outlook we believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our short and long term cash flow needs 
except for and  our earnings from continuing operations before income taxes have increased year over year since in  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges related to real estate lease terminations  severance  litigation  impairments of intangible assets and the adverse impact of foreign currency translation 
in  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges incurred for litigation and retail contingent commission related matters and claims handling obligations 
we expect the historically favorable trend in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes to continue in the foreseeable future because we intend to continue to expand our business through organic growth from existing operations and growth through acquisitions 
additionally  we anticipate that we will continue to use cash flows from operations and  if needed  borrowings under the credit agreement and our common stock to fund acquisitions 
in addition  we may from time to time consider other alternatives for longer term funding sources 
such alternatives could include raising additional capital through public or private debt offerings  equity markets  or restructuring our operations in the event that cash flows from operations are reduced dramatically due to lost business 
cash flows from financing activities on july   we entered into an unsecured multicurrency credit agreement which we refer to as the credit agreement  which expires on july   with a group of twelve financial institutions 
the credit agreement replaced a million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire on october   which was terminated upon the execution of the credit agreement 
all indebtedness  liabilities and obligations outstanding under the prior facility were fully paid and satisfied  except for outstanding letters of credit which became letters of credit under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit commitment of up to million  of which up to million may be used for issuances of standby or commercial letters of credit and up to million may be used for the making of swing loans as defined in the credit agreement 
we may from time to time request  subject to certain conditions  an increase in the revolving credit commitment up to a maximum aggregate revolving credit commitment of million 
in third quarter and fourth quarter  we entered into separate note purchase agreements  with certain accredited institutional investors  pursuant to which we issued and sold to the investors million and million in aggregate debt  respectively 
we are currently in the process of securing another million of long term debt to fund acquisitions  which we expect to close and fund in mid february at december   we had million of corporate related borrowings outstanding under the two note purchase agreements and a cash and cash equivalent balance of million 
we also use our credit agreement from time to time to borrow funds to supplement operating cash flows 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreements and the credit agreement 
no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement at december  due to outstanding letters of credit  million remained available for potential borrowings under the credit agreement at december  during  we borrowed and repaid million under the credit agreement 
principal uses of the borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions  earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
during  we borrowed and repaid million and million  respectively  under a previous credit agreement 
principal uses of the borrowings under a previous credit agreement were to fund acquisitions completed in  earnout payments related to acquisitions completed prior to and general corporate purposes 
during  we borrowed and repaid million and million  respectively  under a previous credit agreement 
principal uses of the borrowings under a previous credit agreement were to fund acquisitions completed in and earnout payments related to acquisitions completed prior to the note purchase agreements and the credit agreement contain various covenants that require us to maintain specified levels of net worth and financial leverage ratios 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  
table of contents dividends our board of directors determines our dividend policy 
our board of directors declares dividends on a quarterly basis after considering our available cash from earnings  our anticipated cash needs and current conditions in the economy and financial markets 
in  we declared million in cash dividends on our common stock  or per common share 
on january   we paid a fourth quarter dividend of 
per common share to shareholders of record as of december  on january   we announced a quarterly dividend for first quarter of 
per common share  a increase over the prior quarter 
if the dividend is maintained at 
per common share throughout  this dividend level would result in an annualized net cash used by financing activities in of approximately million based on the outstanding shares as of december   or an increase in cash used of approximately million 
we can make no assurances regarding the amount of any future dividend payments 
common stock repurchases we have in place a common stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors 
we did not repurchase any shares in  or we generally hold repurchased shares for reissuance in connection with our equity compensation and stock option plans 
under the provisions of the repurchase plan  we were authorized to repurchase approximately  additional shares at december  the plan authorizes the repurchase of our common stock at such times and prices as we may deem advantageous  in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular amount of common stock  and the share repurchase plan can be suspended at any time at our discretion 
funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources  including cash from operations  short term or long term borrowings under our credit agreement or other sources 
the common stock repurchases reported in our consolidated statement of cash flows for  and include  shares at a cost of million   shares at a cost of million and  shares at a cost of million  respectively  that we repurchased from our employees to cover their income tax withholding obligations in connection with restricted stock distributions in each of those years 
under these circumstances  we withhold the proceeds from the repurchases and remit them to the taxing authorities on the employees behalf to cover their income tax withholding obligations 
common stock issuances another source of liquidity to us is the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock under these plans were million in  million in and million in prior to  we issued stock options under four stock option based employee compensation plans 
in may  all of these plans expired 
the options were primarily granted at the fair value of the underlying shares at the date of grant and generally become exercisable at the rate of per year beginning the calendar year after the date of grant 
on may   our stockholders approved the long term incentive plan which we refer to as the ltip 
all of our officers  employees and non employee directors and persons expected to become officers  employees or non employee directors are eligible to receive awards under the ltip 
awards which may be granted under the ltip include non qualified and incentive stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock units and performance units any or all of which may be made contingent upon the achievement of performance criteria 
as of december    shares of our common stock were available for awards granted under the ltip 
in addition  we have an employee stock purchase plan which allows our employees to purchase our common stock at of its fair market value 
prior to january   eligible employees were allowed to purchase our common stock at of its market value 
for all periods prior to january   we recognized compensation expense related to the common stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan 
effective january   we no longer recognize any compensation expense related to the common stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan 
proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to these plans have contributed favorably to net cash provided by financing activities in and we believe this favorable trend will continue in the foreseeable future 
shelf registration statement on may   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec  registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of our common stock 
as previously disclosed  we have used this registration statement to register for re sale shares of our common stock issued as acquisition consideration  but we have not issued any shares under this registration statement 
the availability of the potential liquidity under this shelf registration statement depends on investor demand  market conditions and other factors 
we can make no assurances regarding when  or if  we will issue any shares under this registration statement 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments in connection with our investing and operating activities  we have entered into certain contractual obligations and commitments 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments 
our future minimum cash payments  excluding interest  associated with our contractual obligations pursuant to our note purchase agreements and credit agreement  operating leases and purchase commitments as of december  are as follows in millions payments due by period contractual obligations thereafter total note purchase agreements credit agreement total debt obligations operating lease obligations less sublease arrangements outstanding purchase obligations total contractual obligations the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements  because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation 
in addition  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period in which cash settlements may be made with the respective taxing authorities 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 
note purchase agreements on august   we entered into a note purchase agreement  as amended and restated on december   with certain accredited institutional investors  pursuant to which we issued and sold million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes  series a  due august  and million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes  series b  due august   in a private placement

at december   million of letters of credit for which we have million of liabilities recorded at december  were outstanding under the credit agreement 
no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement at december  accordingly  at december   million remained available for potential borrowings  of which million may be in the form of additional letters of credit 
we are under no obligation to use the credit agreement in performing our normal business operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the credit agreement 
operating lease obligations we generally operate in leased premises 
certain of these leases have options permitting renewals for additional periods 
in addition to minimum fixed rentals  a number of leases contain annual escalation clauses which are generally related to increases in an inflation index 
we have leased certain office space to several non affiliated tenants under operating sublease arrangements 
in the normal course of business  we expect that the leases will not be renewed or replaced 
we adjust charges for real estate taxes and common area maintenance annually based on actual expenses  and we recognize the related revenues in the year in which the expenses are incurred 
these amounts are not included in the minimum future rentals to be received in the contractual obligations table above 
outstanding purchase obligations we typically do not have a material amount of outstanding purchase obligations at any point in time 
the amount disclosed in the contractual obligations table above represents the aggregate amount of unrecorded purchase obligations that we have outstanding as of december  these obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that were executed in the normal course of business

see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our funding commitments related to our corporate segment and the off balance sheet debt section below for a discussion of other letters of credit 
all of our letters of credit represent multiple year commitments that have annual  automatic renewing provisions and are classified by the latest commitment date 
since january   we have acquired companies  all of which were accounted for using the purchase accounting method for recording business combinations 
substantially all of the purchase agreements related to these acquisitions contain provisions for potential earnout obligations 
for all of our acquisitions from and into the future  that contain potential earnout obligations  such obligations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration for the respective acquisition 
the maximum earnout obligations related to the acquisitions are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements  which represent the maximum amount of additional consideration that could be paid pursuant to the purchase agreements related to the applicable acquisitions 
the amounts recorded as earnout payables are primarily based upon estimated future operating results of the acquired businesses over a two to three year period subsequent to the acquisition date 
for acquisitions made prior to  we did not include potential earnout obligations in the recorded purchase price for each applicable acquisition at its respective acquisition date because such obligations are not fixed and determinable 
we will generally record future payments made related to and prior acquisitions  if any  as additional goodwill when the earnouts are settled 
the aggregate amount of maximum unrecorded earnout payables outstanding at december  was million and related to acquisitions we made from to off balance sheet debt our unconsolidated investment portfolio includes investments in enterprises where our ownership interest is between and  in which management has determined that our level of influence and economic interest is not sufficient to require consolidation 
these investments are accounted for using the equity method based on the legal form of our ownership interest and the applicable percentage of the entity owned 
none of these unconsolidated investments had any outstanding debt at december  and that was recourse to us 
at december   we had posted two letters of credit totaling million  in the aggregate  related to our self insurance deductibles  for which we have recorded a liability of million 
we have an equity investment in a rent a captive facility  which we use as a placement facility for certain of our insurance brokerage operations 
at december   we had posted million of letters of credit to allow the rent a captive facility to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements and for additional collateral related to premium and claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity 
these letters of credit have never been drawn upon 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks in our day to day operations 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
the following analyses present the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments we held as of december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and equity prices 
the range of changes in interest rates used in the analyses reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
this discussion of market risks related to our consolidated balance sheet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks 
the effect of actual changes in these market risk factors may differ materially from our estimates 
in the ordinary course of business  we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or unquantifiable  including credit risk and legal risk 
these risks are not included in the following analyses 

table of contents our invested assets are primarily held as cash and cash equivalents  which are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk 
the fair value of our cash and our cash equivalents investment portfolio as of december  approximated its carrying value due to its short term duration 
we estimated market risk as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash equivalents investment portfolio 
the resulting fair values were not materially different from their carrying values at december  we have other investments that have valuations that are indirectly influenced by equity market and general economic conditions  which can change rapidly 
in addition  some investments require direct and active financial and operational support from us 
a future material adverse effect may result from changes in market conditions or if we elect to withdraw financial or operational support 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our note purchase agreements 
the aggregate fair value of these borrowings at december  was million due to their long term duration and fixed interest rates associated with these debt obligations 
no active or observable market exists for our private placement long term debt 
therefore  the estimated fair value of this debt is based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities 
to estimate an all in interest rate for discounting  we obtained market quotes for notes with the same terms as ours  which we have deemed to be the closest approximation of current market rates 
we have not adjusted this rate for risk profile changes  covenant issues or credit rating changes 
we estimated market risk as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in our weighted average borrowing rate as of december  and the resulting fair values would be million higher than their carrying value 
as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement 
however  in the event that we do have borrowings outstanding  the fair value of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their short term duration and variable interest rates 
market risk would be estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in our weighted average short term borrowing rate at december  and the resulting fair values would not be materially different from their carrying values 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from our uk based subsidiaries that incur expenses denominated primarily in british pounds while receiving a substantial portion of their revenues in us dollars 
in addition  we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk from our australian and canadian operations because we transact business in their local denominated currencies 
foreign currency gains losses related to this market risk are recorded in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes as transactions occur 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change of in the average foreign currency exchange rate for a weakening of the us dollar  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes would decrease by approximately million 
assuming a hypothetical favorable change of in the average foreign currency exchange rate for a strengthening of the us dollar  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes would increase by approximately million 
we are also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars 
however  it is management s opinion that this foreign currency exchange risk is not material to our consolidated operating results or financial position 
we manage the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries  where practical  such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets  maintaining a balanced book which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations 
historically  we have not entered into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  with respect to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk in the uk  we have periodically purchased financial instruments when market opportunities arose to minimize our exposure to this risk 
during and  we had several monthly put call options in place with an external financial institution that are designed to hedge a significant portion of our future uk currency disbursements through various future payment dates 
this hedging strategy is designed to protect us against significant uk currency exchange rate movements  but we are still exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk for the portion of our payments and currency exchange rate that are unhedged 
the impact of this hedging strategy was not material to our consolidated financial statements for  and
