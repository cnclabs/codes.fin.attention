item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussions 
real estate operations at january   we had lease agreements  as landlord  for all or parts of eight owned former retail stores  square feet leased and  square feet vacant 
we have owned former retail stores  square feet  that are vacant at january  we are marketing these vacant properties to lease or sell 
in addition  one former distribution center is partially leased  square feet  partially occupied by our corporate office personnel  square feet and partially vacant  square feet 
a typical lease agreement has an initial term of five to twenty years with renewal options 
most of our lessees are responsible for a portion of maintenance  taxes and other executory costs 
we require our lessees to maintain adequate levels of insurance 
we recognized lease revenue of approximately  and  during fiscal years and  respectively 
retail when we operated retail stores  we offered extended service contracts to our customers which typically provided  inclusive of manufacturers warranties  one to five years of warranty coverage 
we plan to manage and administer these contracts and to recognize the associated income and expenses  including the cost to repair or replace covered products  over the remaining life of the contracts 
we have classified as discontinued operations all retail related activities  including those activities associated with extended service plans  in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
facilities at january   we owned eight former retail store properties that were leased to outside  unrelated parties 
of the eight leased properties  one of the properties is only partially leased 
there were also vacant former retail store properties that we were attempting to either lease or sell 
in addition  we have one former distribution center that is partially leased  partially occupied by our corporate office and partially vacant 
employees at january   we had eight employees supporting our corporate functions 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we expect this employment to remain relatively stable at its current level as we have completed our exit from the retail business 
at january   one earth had employees 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be good 
service marks we have registered our service mark rex  and we own an application to register the mark farmers energy  with the united states patent and trademark office 
we are not aware of any adverse claims concerning our service marks 
item a 
risk factors we encourage you to carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this report when considering an investment decision in rex common stock 
any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur 
if one or more of these events do occur  our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
in this instance  the trading price of rex stock could decline  and investors might lose all or part of their investment 
we have concentrations of cash deposits at financial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits 
we generally have cash deposits that exceed federal insurance limits 
should the financial institutions we deposit our cash at experience insolvency or other financial difficulty  our access to cash deposits could be limited 
in extreme cases  we could lose our cash deposits entirely 
this would negatively impact our liquidity and results of operations 
the current interest rate environment has resulted in lower yields on our excess cash 
we have experienced lower yields on our excess cash compared to historical yields 
should the present economic conditions result in a sustained period of historically low interest rates  our interest income would be negatively impacted 
risks related to our synthetic fuel investments and income tax benefits we face synthetic fuel risks as future irs audits may result in the disallowance of previously recognized tax credits 
we have recognized investment income of approximately million from the sales of our partnership interests from years that the partnerships have not been audited by the internal revenue service irs 
should the tax credits be denied on any future audit and we fail to prevail through the irs or the legal process  there could be significant refunds of previously recognized income with a significant adverse impact on earnings and cash flows 
the production and sale of synthetic fuel qualified for section k tax credits if certain requirements were satisfied  including a requirement that the synthetic fuel differs significantly in chemical composition from the coal used to produce the synthetic fuel and that the fuel was produced from a facility placed in service before july  we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
we have approximately million of net deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated financial statements 
should future results of operations or other factors cause us to determine that it is unlikely that we will generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize our deferred tax assets  we would then be required to establish a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets 
we would increase our income tax expense by the amount of the tax benefit we do not expect to realize 
this would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial position 
risks related to our alternative energy business certain of our ethanol investments are subject to the risks of a development stage business which could adversely affect returns on our ethanol investment and our results of operations 
we do not have long term experience investing in the ethanol industry 
we entered into our first agreement to invest in an ethanol plant in november at january   we were invested in five entities that own and operate seven ethanol production facilities 
one facility has been in production since  but the remaining facilities all became operational or were acquired in fiscal year or later 
our ethanol investments have been managed by our chief executive officer  our chief operating officer and our chief financial officer 
we do not otherwise have a dedicated ethanol development or management staff 
as a consequence  our ethanol investments are subject to many of the risks associated with a development stage company  including an unproven business model  a lack of operating history and an undeveloped operating structure 
these development stage risks could result in our making investments in ethanol plants that perform substantially below our expectations  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
if cash flow from operations of our ethanol plants is not sufficient to service debt  the plants could fail and we could lose our entire investment 
our ethanol plants financed approximately of plant construction cost with debt 
the debt typically has a balloon payment due after five years 
the ability of each company owning the plant to repay borrowings incurred will depend upon the plant s financial and operating performance 
the cash flows and capital resources of an ethanol plant may be insufficient to repay its debt obligations 
if a plant cannot service its debt  it may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  restructure its indebtedness or seek additional capital 
if unable to do so  the value of our investment could decline significantly 
the institutional senior lenders to the companies which own and operate our ethanol plants hold liens on the plant s assets 
if a company fails to make its debt service payments  the senior lender will have the right to repossess the plant s assets in addition to other remedies  which are superior to our rights as an equity investor or subordinated lender 
such action could have a material adverse impact on our investment in the ethanol plant 
we operate in a capital intensive industry 
limitations to external financing could adversely affect our financial performance 
in general  continued volatility in the capital markets has resulted in reduced availability of capital for the ethanol industry 
we may need to incur additional financing to fund growth of our business or in times of increasing liquidity requirements such as increases in raw material costs 
any delays to obtain additional financing  or our inability to do so  could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
the financial returns on our ethanol investments are highly dependent on commodity prices  which are subject to significant volatility and uncertainty  and the availability of supplies  so our results could fluctuate substantially 
the financial returns on our ethanol investments are substantially dependent on commodity prices  especially prices for corn or other feedstock  natural gas  ethanol and unleaded gasoline 
as a result of the volatility of the prices for these items  the returns may fluctuate substantially and our investments could experience periods of declining prices for their products and increasing costs for their raw materials  which could result in operating losses at our ethanol plants 
our returns on ethanol investments are highly sensitive to grain prices 
corn or sorghum are the principal raw materials our ethanol plants use to produce ethanol and co products 
as a result  changes in the price of corn or sorghum can significantly affect their businesses 
rising corn or sorghum prices result in higher costs of ethanol and co products 
because ethanol competes with non corn based fuels  our ethanol plants generally will be unable to pass along increased grain costs to their customers 
at certain levels  grain prices may make ethanol uneconomical to produce 
the price of corn and sorghum is influenced by weather conditions and other factors affecting crop yields  transportation costs  farmer planting decisions  exports  the value of the us dollar and general economic  market and regulatory factors 
these factors include government policies and subsidies with respect to agriculture and international trade  and global and local demand and supply 
the significance and relative effect of these factors on the price of corn and sorghum is difficult to predict 
any event that tends to negatively affect the supply of corn or sorghum  such as adverse weather or crop disease  could increase corn and sorghum prices and potentially harm the business of our ethanol plants 
increasing domestic ethanol capacity could boost the demand for corn and sorghum and result in increased corn or sorghum prices 
our ethanol plants may also have difficulty  from time to time  in physically sourcing corn or sorghum on economical terms due to supply shortages 
such a shortage could require our ethanol plants to suspend operations which would have a material adverse effect on the financial returns on our ethanol investments 
the spread between ethanol and corn and sorghum prices can vary significantly 
the gross margin at our ethanol plants depends principally on the spread between ethanol and corn or sorghum prices 
fluctuations in the spread are likely to continue to occur 
a sustained narrow spread or any further reduction in the spread between ethanol and corn prices  whether as a result of sustained high or increased corn prices or sustained low or decreased ethanol prices  would adversely affect the results of operations at our ethanol plants 
the market for natural gas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in the price and availability of the natural gas that our ethanol plants use in their manufacturing process 
our ethanol plants rely upon third parties for their supply of natural gas  which is consumed as fuel in the manufacture of ethanol 
the prices for and availability of natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions 
these market conditions often are affected by factors beyond the ethanol plants control  such as weather conditions  overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulation and relations 
significant disruptions in the supply of natural gas could impair the ethanol plants ability to economically manufacture ethanol for their customers 
furthermore  increases in natural gas prices or changes in our natural gas costs relative to natural gas costs paid by competitors may adversely affect results of operations and financial position at our ethanol plants 
fluctuations in the selling price and production costs of gasoline may reduce profit margins at our ethanol plants 
ethanol is marketed as a fuel additive to reduce vehicle emissions from gasoline  as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended and  to a lesser extent  as a gasoline substitute 
as a result  ethanol prices are influenced by the supply and demand for gasoline and our ethanol plants results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected if gasoline demand or price decreases 
new plants under construction or decreases in demand for ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanol industry  which may cause the price of ethanol and or distillers grains to decrease 
according to the renewable fuels association  or rfa  domestic ethanol production nameplate capacity has increased to approximately billion gallons per year at january the rfa estimates that  as of january  approximately million gallons per year of additional production capacity is under construction 
excess capacity in the ethanol industry would have an adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments 
in a manufacturing industry with excess capacity  producers have an incentive to manufacture additional products for so long as the price exceeds the marginal cost of production ie  the cost of producing only the next unit  without regard for interest  overhead or fixed costs 
this incentive could result in the reduction of the market price of ethanol to a level that is inadequate to generate sufficient cash flow to cover costs 
excess capacity may also result from decreases in the demand for ethanol  which could result from a number of factors  including  but not limited to  regulatory developments and reduced us gasoline consumption 
reduced gasoline consumption could occur as a result of increased prices for gasoline or crude oil  which could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquire vehicles with more favorable gasoline mileage or acquire hybrid vehicles 
in addition  because ethanol production produces distillers grains as a co product  increased ethanol production will also lead to increased supplies of distillers grains 
an increase in the supply of distillers grains  without corresponding increases in demand  could lead to lower prices or an inability to sell our ethanol plants distillers grains production 
a decline in the price of distillers grains or the distillers grains market generally could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments 
we depend on our partners to operate our ethanol investments 
our investments currently represent both majority and minority equity positions  and day to day operating control of each plant generally remains with the local farmers cooperative or investor group that has promoted the plant 
we may not have the ability to directly modify the operations of the plants in response to changes in the business environment or in response to any deficiencies in local operations of the plants 
in addition  local plant operators  who also represent the primary suppliers of corn and other crops to the plants  may have interests  such as the price and sourcing of corn and other crops  that may differ from our interest  which is based solely on the operating profit of the plant 
the limitations on our ability to control day to day plant operations could adversely affect plant results of operations 
we may not successfully acquire or develop additional ethanol investments 
the growth of our ethanol business depends on our ability to identify and develop new ethanol investments 
our ethanol development strategy depends on referrals  and introductions  to new investment opportunities from industry participants  such as ethanol plant builders  financial institutions  marketing agents and others 
we must continue to maintain favorable relationships with these industry participants  and a material disruption in these sources of referrals would adversely affect our ability to expand our ethanol investments 
any expansion strategy will depend on prevailing market conditions for the price of ethanol and the costs of corn and natural gas and the expectations of future market conditions 
there is increasing competition for suitable sites for ethanol plants 
even if suitable sites or opportunities are identified  we may not be able to secure the services and products from contractors  engineering firms  construction firms and equipment suppliers necessary to build or expand ethanol plants on a timely basis or on acceptable economic terms 
construction costs associated with expansion may increase to levels that would make a new plant too expensive to complete or unprofitable to operate 
additional financing may also be necessary to implement any expansion strategy  which may not be accessible or available on acceptable terms 
our ethanol plants may be adversely affected by technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ such technological advances may prove unsuccessful 
the development and implementation of new technologies may result in a significant reduction in the costs of ethanol production 
for instance  any technological advances in the efficiency or cost to produce ethanol from inexpensive  cellulosic sources such as wheat  oat or barley straw could have an adverse effect on our ethanol plants  because those facilities are designed to produce ethanol from corn  which is  by comparison  a raw material with other high value uses 
we cannot predict when new technologies may become available  the rate of acceptance of new technologies by competitors or the costs associated with new technologies 
in addition  advances in the development of alternatives to ethanol could significantly reduce demand for or eliminate the need for ethanol 
any advances in technology which require significant unanticipated capital expenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for ethanol would have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments 
in addition  alternative fuels  additives and oxygenates are continually under development 
alternative fuel additives that can replace ethanol may be developed  which may decrease the demand for ethanol 
it is also possible that technological advances in engine and exhaust system design and performance could reduce the use of oxygenates  which would lower the demand for ethanol  and the results of our ethanol investments may be materially adversely affected 
the us ethanol industry is highly dependent upon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in legislation or regulation could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
the elimination or significant reduction of the blender s credit could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments 
the cost of production of ethanol is made significantly more competitive with regular gasoline by federal tax incentives 
the american jobs creation act of created the volumetric ethanol tax credit  referred to as the blender s credit 
this credit currently allows gasoline distributors who blend ethanol with gasoline to receive a federal excise tax credit of per gallon of pure ethanol  or per gallon if blended with ethanol e  and per gallon if blended with ethanol e 
the per gallon incentive for ethanol was scheduled to expire on december  but was extended to december  the blender s credit could be eliminated or reduced at any time through an act of congress and may not be renewed in or may be renewed on different terms 
in addition  the blender s credit  as well as other federal and state programs benefiting ethanol such as tariffs  generally are subject to us government obligations under international trade agreements  including those under the world trade organization agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures  and might be the subject of challenges thereunder  in whole or in part 
ethanol can be imported into the us duty free from some countries  which may undermine the ethanol industry in the us imported ethanol is generally subject to a per gallon tariff that was designed to offset the per gallon ethanol incentive that is available under the federal excise tax incentive program for refineries that blend ethanol in their fuel 
a special exemption from the tariff  known as the caribbean basin initiative  exists for ethanol imported from countries in central america and the caribbean islands  which is limited to a total of of us production per year 
imports from the exempted countries may increase as a result of new plants under development 
since production costs for ethanol in these countries are estimated to be significantly less than what they are in the us  the duty free import of ethanol through the countries exempted from the tariff may negatively affect the demand for domestic ethanol and the price at which our ethanol plants sell ethanol 
any changes in the tariff or exemption from the tariff could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments 
in addition  the north america free trade agreement  or nafta  allows canada and mexico to export ethanol to the united states duty free 
the effect of the renewable fuel standard rfs program in the energy independence and security act of the act is uncertain 
the mandated minimum level of use of renewable fuels in the rfs under the act will increase from billion gallons per year in to billion gallons per year in the rfs mandate level for conventional biofuels  which includes corn based ethanol  for is billion gallons 
this requirement progressively increases to billion gallons by and remains at that level through the act also requires the increased use of advanced biofuels  which are alternative biofuels produced without using corn starch such as cellulosic ethanol and biomass based diesel  with billion gallons of the mandated billion gallons of renewable fuel required to come from advanced biofuels by required rfs volumes for both general and advanced renewable fuels in years to follow will be determined by a governmental administrator  in coordination with the us department of energy and us department of agriculture 
increased competition from other types of biofuels could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments 
the rfs program and the act also include provisions allowing credits to be granted to fuel producers who blend in their fuel more than the required percentage of renewable fuels in a given year 
these credits may be used in subsequent years to satisfy rfs production percentage and volume standards and may be traded to other parties 
the accumulation of excess credits could further reduce the impact of the rfs mandate schedule and result in a lower ethanol price or could result in greater fluctuations in demand for ethanol from year to year  both of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments 
waivers of the rfs minimum levels of renewable fuels included in gasoline could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments 
under the rfs as passed as part of the energy policy act of  the us environmental protection agency  in consultation with the secretary of agriculture and the secretary of energy  may waive the renewable fuels mandate with respect to one or more states if the administrator of the us environmental protection agency  or epa  determines upon the petition of one or more states that implementing the requirements would severely harm the economy or the environment of a state  a region or the us  or that there is inadequate supply to meet the requirement 
in addition  the act allows any other person subject to the requirements of the rfs or the epa administrator to file a petition for such a waiver 
any waiver of the rfs with respect to one or more states could adversely offset demand for ethanol and could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments 
changes in corporate average fuel economy standards could adversely impact ethanol prices 
flexible fuel vehicles receive preferential treatment in meeting federally mandated corporate average fuel economy cafe standards for automobiles manufactured by car makers 
high blend ethanol fuels such as e result in lower fuel efficiencies 
absent the cafe preferences  car makers would not likely build flexible fuel vehicles 
any change in cafe preferences could reduce the growth of e markets and result in lower ethanol prices 
various studies have criticized the efficiency of ethanol  in general  and corn based ethanol in particular  which could lead to the reduction or repeal of incentives and tariffs that promote the use and domestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impact public perception and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel 
although many trade groups  academics and governmental agencies have supported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment  others have criticized ethanol production as consuming considerably more energy and emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentially depleting water resources 
other studies have suggested that corn based ethanol is less efficient than ethanol produced from switchgrass or wheat grain and that it negatively impacts consumers by causing prices for dairy  meat and other foodstuffs from livestock that consume corn to increase 
if these views gain acceptance  support for existing measures promoting use and domestic production of corn based ethanol could decline  leading to reduction or repeal of these measures 
these views could also negatively impact public perception of the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel 
federal support of cellulosic ethanol may result in reduced incentives to corn derived ethanol producers 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of and the energy independence and security act of provide funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanol obtained from biomass sources such as switchgrass and poplar trees 
the amended rfs mandates an increasing level of production of non corn derived biofuels 
these federal policies may suggest a long term political preference for cellulosic processes using alternative feedstocks such as switchgrass  silage or wood chips 
cellulosic ethanol has a smaller carbon footprint and is unlikely to divert foodstuff from the market 
several cellulosic ethanol plants are under development and there is a risk that cellulosic ethanol could displace corn ethanol 
our plants are designed as single feedstock facilities  located in corn production areas with limited alternative feedstock nearby  and would require significant additional investment to convert to the production of cellulosic ethanol 
the adoption of cellulosic ethanol as the preferred form of ethanol could have a significant adverse effect on our ethanol business 
our ethanol business is affected by environmental and other regulations which could impede or prohibit our ability to successfully operate our plants 
our ethanol production facilities are subject to extensive air  water and other environmental regulations 
we have had to obtain numerous permits to construct and operate our plants 
regulatory agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental or which increase our costs 
more stringent federal or state environmental regulations could be adopted which could significantly increase our operating costs or require us to expend considerable resources 
our ethanol plants emit various airborne pollutants as by products of the ethanol production process  including carbon dioxide 
in  the us supreme court classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the clean air act in a case seeking to require the epa to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions 
in february  the epa released its final regulations on the renewable fuel standard program rfs 
we believe our plants are grandfathered at their current operating capacity  but plant expansion will need to meet a threshold reduction in greenhouse gas ghg emissions from a baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the rfs mandate 
additionally  legislation is pending in congress on a comprehensive carbon dioxide regulatory scheme  such as a carbon tax or cap and trade system 
to expand our plant capacity  we may be required to obtain additional permits  install advanced technology such as corn oil extraction  or reduce drying of certain amounts of distillers grains 
the california air resources board has adopted a low carbon fuel standard requiring a reduction in ghg emissions from transportation fuels by an indirect land use charge is included in this lifecycle ghg emission calculation 
while this standard is being challenged by lawsuits  implementation of such a standard could have an adverse impact on our market for corn based ethanol if determined that in california corn based ethanol fails to achieve lifecycle ghg emission reductions 
our revenue from the sale of distillers grains depends upon its continued market acceptance as an animal feed 
distillers grains is a co product from the fermentation of corn to produce ethanol 
antibiotics may be used during the fermentation process to control bacterial contamination  therefore antibiotics may be present in small quantities in distillers grains marketed as animal feed 
the u 
s 
food and drug administration s  or fda s  center for veterinary medicine has expressed concern about potential animal and human health hazards from the use of distillers grains as an animal feed due to the possibility of antibiotic residues 
if the public became concerned about the impact of distillers grains in the food supply or as an acceptable animal feed  the market for distillers grains could be negatively impacted  which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
the price of distillers grains may decline as a result of china s antidumping investigation of distillers grains originating in the united sates 
estimates indicate that as much as to percent of the distiller grains produced in the united states will be exported to china in the coming year 
however  this export market may be jeopardized if the chinese government imposes trade barriers in response to the outcome of an antidumping investigation currently being conducted by the chinese ministry of commerce 
if producers and exporters of distiller grains are subjected to trade barriers when selling distiller grains to chinese customers  there may be a reduction in the price of distillers grains in the united states 
declines in the price we receive for our distillers grains could lead to decreased revenues and may result in our inability to operate the ethanol plant profitably 
we face significant competition in the ethanol industry 
we face significant competition for new ethanol investment opportunities 
there are varied enterprises seeking to participate in the ethanol industry 
some enterprises provide financial and management support similar to our business model 
other enterprises seek to acquire or develop plants which they will directly own and operate 
many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do 
we must compete for investment opportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancing local development of ethanol plant opportunities 
we may not be successful in competing for investment opportunities based on our strategy 
the ethanol industry is primarily comprised of smaller entities that engage exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companies that produce ethanol along with their base grain business 
recently  several large oil companies have entered the ethanol production market 
if these companies increase their ethanol plant ownership or other oil companies seek to engage in direct ethanol production  there would be less of a need to purchase ethanol from independent producers like our ethanol plants 
there is a consolidation trend in the ethanol industry  partly a result of companies recently seeking protection under the united states bankruptcy code 
as a result  firms are growing in size and scope 
larger firms offer efficiencies and economies of scale  resulting in lower costs of production 
in addition  plants currently being or recently sold as part of a bankruptcy proceeding may have significantly lower costs than our ethanol plants 
absent significant growth and diversification  our ethanol plants may not be able to operate profitably in a more competitive environment 
no assurance can be given that our ethanol plants will be able to compete successfully or that competition from larger companies with greater financial resources will not have a materially adverse affect on the results of our ethanol investments 
we are exposed to credit risk from our sales of ethanol and distillers grains to customers 
the inability of a customer to make payments to us for our accounts receivable may cause us to experience losses and may adversely impact our liquidity and our ability to make our payments when due 
we may not be able to hire and retain qualified personnel to operate our ethanol plants 
our ability to attract and retain competent personnel has a significant impact on operating efficiencies and plant profitability 
competition for key plant employees in the ethanol industry can be intense  and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees 
failure to do so could have a negative impact on our financial results at individual plants 
our plants depend on an uninterrupted supply of energy and water to operate 
unforeseen plant shutdowns could harm our business 
our plants require a significant and uninterrupted supply of natural gas  electricity and water to operate 
we generally rely on third parties to provide these resources 
if there is an interruption in the supply of energy or water for any reason  such as supply  delivery or mechanical problems and we are unable to secure an adequate alternative supply to sustain plant operations  we may be required to stop production 
a production halt for an extended period of time could result in material losses 
potential business disruption from factors outside our control  including natural disasters  severe weather conditions  accidents  strikes  unexpected equipment failures and unforeseen plant shutdowns  could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results 
the debt agreements for the ethanol plants contain restrictive financial and performance covenants 
our subsidiaries that operate ethanol plants ethanol subsidiaries have debt agreements that contain covenants with several financial and performance restrictions 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the applicable agreement 
if a default were to occur  the ethanol subsidiary would likely seek a waiver of that default  attempt to reset the covenant  or refinance the instrument and accompanying obligations 
if the ethanol subsidiary was unable to obtain this relief  the default could result in the acceleration of the total due related to that debt obligation 
if a default were to occur  the ethanol subsidiary may not be able to pay its debts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance them 
in addition  certain lease agreements could also be in default if a default of the debt agreement occurs 
any of these events  if they occur  could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
the debt agreements for the ethanol plants limit  or otherwise restrict the amount of dividends and other payments the ethanol operating subsidiaries can transfer to their members 
we are dependent on dividends from our ethanol subsidiaries to generate cash flow 
presently  all of our ethanol subsidiaries have debt agreements that limit payments to members 
therefore  these companies cannot distribute all of the cash they generate to their members 
furthermore  we may not be able to use the excess cash flow from one subsidiary to fund corporate needs or needs of another operating ethanol subsidiary 
changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments 
one earth and patriot have interest rate swaps at january  that  in essence  fix the interest rate on a portion of their variable rate debt 
during fiscal years  and  we recognized losses on these swaps 
further reductions in interest rates could increase the liability position of the interest rate swaps  requiring us to record additional expense which could be material 
the liability for these interest rate swaps could also result in a default of the term loan agreements restrictive financial covenants 
in addition  increases in interest rates could have a negative impact on results of operations as all of the debt our ethanol plants have is variable rate debt 
furthermore  the interest rate swaps do not fix the interest rate on the entire portion of the related debt 
risks related to the wind down and exit of our retail business and risks related to our real estate segment 
our future costs associated with administering extended product service contracts may result in higher than expected costs 
we will continue to administer extended product service contracts that have contractual maturities over the next three years 
to the extent we do not have products or an adequate repair service network to satisfy warranty claims  we may incur material costs as we would be required to refund cash to customers for warranted products 
we have a significant amount of vacant warehouse and retail space after the completion of the wind down of our retail business 
at january   we own one distribution facility and former retail store properties comprising approximately  square feet that are completely or partially vacant 
we are currently marketing these facilities for lease or sale 
we may not be able to successfully lease or sell these properties which could result in lost opportunities for revenue or future impairment charges related to the carrying value of the associated assets 
we also have costs related to the vacant properties such as property taxes and utilities that we would have to bear without any revenue from such properties

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview historically  we were a specialty retailer in the consumer electronics and appliance industry serving small to medium sized towns and communities 
in addition  we have been an investor in various alternative energy entities beginning with synthetic fuel partnerships in and later ethanol production facilities beginning in in fiscal year  we began to evaluate strategic alternatives for our retail segment with a focus on closing unprofitable or marginally profitable retail stores and monetizing our retail related real estate assets 
we did not believe that we were generating an adequate return from our retail business due to the competitive nature of the consumer electronics and appliance industry and the overall economic conditions in the united states 
reflecting this focus  we sold approximately of our owned retail and vacant stores in fiscal year and leased back a portion of the stores which had been operating as electronics and appliance retail stores 
in fiscal year  we commenced an evaluation of a broad range of alternatives intended to derive value from the remaining retail operations and our remaining real estate portfolio 
we engaged an investment banking firm to assist us in analyzing and ultimately marketing our retail operations 
as part of those marketing efforts  late in fiscal year  we initially leased owned store locations to an unrelated third party 
during fiscal year  the lease agreements were terminated 
at january   we had lease agreements for all or parts of eight former retail properties and had vacant former retail properties 
we also own one former distribution center  which is partially leased  partially occupied by our corporate office personnel and partially vacant 
we are marketing the vacant properties to lease or sell 
should our marketing efforts result in additional tenants to whom we lease property  we would expect to execute leases with a term of five to twenty years 
we completed our exit of the retail business as of july  going forward  our only retail related activities will consist of the administration of extended service plans we previously sold and the payment of related claims 
all activities related to extended service plans will be classified as discontinued operations 
we currently have equity and debt investments in five ethanol production entities  one of which we have a majority ownership interest in 
we may make additional investments in the alternative energy segment during fiscal year our ethanol operations are highly dependent on commodity prices  especially prices for corn  sorghum  ethanol  distillers grains and natural gas 
as a result of price volatility for these commodities  our operating results can fluctuate substantially 
the price and availability of corn and sorghum are subject to significant fluctuations depending upon a number of factors that affect commodity prices in general  including crop conditions  weather  federal policy and foreign trade 
because the market price of ethanol is not always directly related to corn and sorghum prices  at times ethanol prices may lag movements in corn prices and  in an environment of higher prices  reduce the overall margin structure at the plants 
as a result  at times  we may operate our plants at negative or marginally positive operating margins 
we expect our ethanol plants to produce approximately gallons of ethanol for each bushel of grain processed in the production cycle 
we refer to the difference between the price per gallon of ethanol and the price per bushel of grain divided by as the crush spread 
should the crush spread decline  our ethanol plants are likely to generate operating results that do not provide adequate cash flows for sustained periods of time 
in such cases  production at the ethanol plants may be reduced or stopped altogether in order to minimize variable costs at individual plants 
we expect these decisions to be made on an individual plant basis  as there are different market conditions at each of our ethanol plants 
we attempt to manage the risk related to the volatility of grain and ethanol prices by utilizing forward grain purchase and forward ethanol and distillers grain sale contracts 
we attempt to match quantities of ethanol and distillers grains sale contracts with an appropriate quantity of grain purchase contracts over a given period of time when we can obtain an adequate gross margin resulting from the crush spread inherent in the contracts we have executed 
however  the market for future ethanol sales contracts is not a mature market 
consequently  we generally execute contracts for no more than three months into the future at any given time 
as a result of the relatively short period of time our contracts cover  we generally cannot predict the future movements in the crush spread for more than three months  we are unable to predict the likelihood or amounts of future income or loss from the operations of our ethanol facilities 
the crush spread realized in was subject to significant volatility 
for calendar year  the average chicago board of trade cbot near month corn price was approximately per bushel  with highs reaching approximately per bushel in december we believe corn prices were affected late in the year by global weather conditions  export demand  speculation  currency valuation and global economic conditions 
ethanol prices also had significant fluctuations ranging from approximately per gallon in june to approximately per gallon in december 
ethanol and corn prices have tended to trade in the same direction but with narrowing spreads  particularly late in the year 
in  the cbot crush spread ranged from a low of approximately per gallon in december to a high of approximately per gallon in february 
we believe ethanol demand late in was also impacted by the uncertainty of the extension of the veetc blender credit 
crush spreads have continued to decline in and have at times  become negative absent the consideration of distillers grains 
prices for distillers grains we sell have generally trended with grain prices 
these prices have partially offset the decline in the crush spread 
we reported segment profit before income taxes and noncontrolling interests from our alternative energy segment of approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year the decline in profitability primarily resulted from impairment charges and loss on deconsolidation of levelland hockley 
levelland hockley reported a loss from operations and as a result of narrowing crush spreads was shut down in january these losses were partially offset as one earth was in production for a full year during fiscal year and operated profitably 
we expect that future operating results will be based upon annual production of between and million gallons of ethanol  which assumes that one earth will operate at or near nameplate capacity 
however  due to the inherent volatility of the crush spread  we cannot predict the likelihood of future operating results being similar to the results 
ethanol investments in fiscal year  we entered the alternative energy industry by investing in several entities organized to construct and  subsequently operate  ethanol producing plants 
we have invested in six entities  five of which we remain invested in as of january   utilizing both equity and debt investments 
we sold our investment in millennium during fiscal year the following table is a summary of our ethanol investments at january entity nameplate production capacity million gallons per year effective ownership percentage effective nameplate capacity owned million gallons per year one earth energy  llc nugen energy  llc patriot renewable fuels  llc big river resources  llc w burlington big river resources  llc galva big river united energy  llc levelland hockley county ethanol  llc total one earth commenced production operations late in the second quarter of fiscal year and began generating revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year effective july   we acquired a equity interest in nugen which operates an ethanol producing facility in marion  south dakota with a nameplate capacity of million gallons of ethanol and  tons of ddg per year 
patriot commenced production operations in the second quarter of fiscal year big river completed construction in the second quarter of fiscal year of its second plant which has a nameplate capacity of million gallons of ethanol and  tons of ddg per year 
the plant is located in galva  illinois 
in august  big river acquired a interest in an ethanol production facility which has a nameplate capacity of million gallons of ethanol and  tons of ddg per year 
the plant is located in dyersville  iowa 
the levelland hockley plant was shut down in early january as a result of industry wide low crush spread margins and the plant s inability to source grain at affordable prices 
on january  we sold  of our membership units to levelland hockley for  reducing our ownership interest in levelland hockley to 
as a result  we no longer have a controlling financial interest in levelland hockley  and  therefore  effective january   we deconsolidated levelland hockley and began using the equity method of accounting to account for the results of levelland hockley 
in connection with the deconsolidation  we recorded our remaining non controlling equity interest and our debt investments at fair value 
our estimate of fair value for all of our investments in levelland hockley was at january  we recorded a pretax charge of approximately million as a result of deconsolidating levelland hockley and writing our remaining investments in levelland hockley to at january  investment in synthetic fuel partnerships we had invested in three limited partnerships which owned facilities producing synthetic fuel 
the partnerships earned federal income tax credits under section k of the internal revenue code based upon the tonnage and content of solid synthetic fuel produced and sold to unrelated parties 
the section k tax credit program expired on december  as such we do not expect to receive additional income from these investments except for the possibility of an additional payment on a facility formerly located in gillette  wyoming 
based upon the modified terms of a sales agreement  we are currently not able to predict the likelihood and timing of payments for production from september  to december  for this facility 
we expect the payments  if any  to be made within the next year 
we have not recognized this income and will recognize income  if any  upon receipt of payment or upon our ability to reasonably assure ourselves of the timing and collectability of payment 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussions 
see item a risk factors for further discussion of the risks involved with our synthetic fuel investments 
real estate operations at january   we had lease agreements  as landlord  for all or parts of eight owned former retail stores  square feet leased and  square feet vacant 
we have owned former retail stores  square feet that are vacant at january  we are marketing these vacant properties to lease or sell 
in addition  one former distribution center is partially leased  square feet  partially occupied by our corporate office personnel  square feet and partially vacant  square feet 
retail we completed the exit of our retail business during the second quarter of fiscal year we offered extended service contracts to our customers which typically provide  inclusive of manufacturers warranties  one to five years of warranty coverage 
we plan to manage and administer these contracts over the life of the contracts 
service contract repair costs are charged to operations as incurred 
we expect to continue recognizing extended service contract revenues and expenses as discontinued operations through january  although the revenues will decline annually as we are no longer selling new contracts 
we typically service a warranty claim through a network of third party repair and service providers 
warranty repair costs have been in the range of to of extended service contract revenue over the last three years  we expect these costs to average approximately of extended service contract revenue in future years 
future expected amortization of deferred revenue and commission expense are as follows amounts in thousands years ended january  deferred revenue deferred commission expense total results of operations for a detailed analysis of period to period changes  see the segment discussion that follows this section as this is how management views and monitors our business 
comparison of fiscal years ended january  and net sales and revenue net sales and revenue in fiscal year were million  a increase from million in fiscal year net sales and revenue do not include sales from retail and real estate operations classified in discontinued operations 
the increase was primarily caused by higher sales in our alternative energy segment of million and a full year of production at our consolidated subsidiary  one earth 
net sales and revenue from our real estate segment increased million over the prior year to million 
the following table reflects the approximate percent of net sales and revenue for each product and service group for the periods presented fiscal year product or service category ethanol distiller grains leasing total gross profit gross profit was million in fiscal year  or of net sales and revenue  versus million in fiscal year or of net sales and revenue 
this represents an increase of million 
gross profit for fiscal year increased by million over the prior year as a result of operations in the alternative energy segment 
gross loss for fiscal year decreased by million compared to the prior year from our real estate segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year were million of net sales and revenue  an increase of million or from million of net sales and revenue for fiscal year compared to the prior year  these expenses increased approximately million and million in the alternative energy segment and the corporate and other category  respectively 
impairment charges and loss on deconsolidation during fiscal year  we recognized losses totaling approximately million related to the impairment of notes receivable from levelland hockley and the deconsolidation of levelland hockley 
effective january   we sold a portion of our equity interest in levelland hockley 
as a result we no longer have a controlling financial interest in levelland hockley  and  therefore  effective january   we deconsolidated levelland hockley and recorded our retained investment in levelland hockley at fair value as of january  we recognized an impairment loss related to the notes receivable of approximately million during fiscal year we also recognized a loss on deconsolidation of approximately million during fiscal year interest income interest income of million for fiscal year was consistent with fiscal year interest expense interest expense increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the alternative energy segment as we had higher amounts of average debt outstanding upon the completion of one earth s ethanol plant and that we are no longer capitalizing interest costs 
loss on early termination of debt during fiscal years and  we completed the early payoff of million and million  respectively  of mortgage debt prior to maturity 
as a result  we expensed certain unamortized financing costs and prepayment penalties of approximately  and  during fiscal years and  respectively  as loss on early termination of debt 
equity in income of unconsolidated ethanol affiliates during fiscal years and  we recognized income of approximately million and million  respectively from our equity investments in big river  patriot and nugen 
big river has a million gallon plant which has been in operation since big river opened an additional million gallon plant during the second quarter of fiscal year and acquired a ownership in a million gallon plant in august patriot has an ethanol facility with a nameplate capacity of million gallons which has been in operation since the second quarter of fiscal year effective july   we acquired a equity interest in nugen which operates an ethanol producing facility in marion  south dakota with an annual nameplate capacity of million gallons 
income from big river was approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
although our proportionate share of income from big river has been consistent over the prior two years  big river benefited in the current year from a full year of production at its big river galva and big river united energy facilities during fiscal year we recorded income of approximately million and million from patriot in fiscal years and  respectively 
patriot experienced a decline in interest expense of approximately million  as its term debt is variable rate debt  and interest rates declined in fiscal year patriot also recognized a gain on the early extinguishment of debt of approximately million 
we recognized approximately million of income from nugen in the current year 
this was the first year we reported income from nugen given that the acquisition of our interest in nugen was effective july overall  we expect the trends in crush spread margins described in the overview section to be generally consistent with the operating experience of big river  patriot and nugen as their results are dependent on the same key drivers corn and natural gas pricing as well ethanol pricing  all of which are commodities 
due to the inherent volatility of the crush spread  we cannot predict the likelihood of future operating results from big river  patriot and nugen being similar to the fiscal year results 
other income during fiscal year  levelland hockley received notification from the united states department of agriculture that they had been approved to receive funds under the advanced biofuel producer program 
as a result  approximately million was recognized as other income during fiscal year we recognized approximately million of other income from this grant during fiscal year during fiscal year  levelland hockley entered into an agreement to settle litigation and received million as a condition of the settlement 
of the proceeds received  approximately million was recognized as other income during fiscal year we do not expect other income to be significant in future periods 
losses on derivative financial instruments we recognized losses of approximately million and million during fiscal years and  respectively  related to forward interest rate swaps that levelland hockley and one earth entered into during fiscal year during fiscal year  levelland hockley s loss was insignificant and one earth s loss was million 
levelland hockley s swap expired in april while one earth s swaps expire in july and july in general  declining interest rates have a negative effect on our interest rate swaps as our swaps fixed the interest rate of variable rate debt 
as interest rates declined during fiscal years and  we incurred large losses on the interest rate swaps 
should interest rates continue to decline  we would expect to experience continued losses on the interest rate swaps 
we would expect to incur gains on the interest rate swaps should interest rates increase 
we cannot predict the future movements in interest rates  thus  we are unable to predict the likelihood or amounts of future gains or losses related to interest rate swaps 
income taxes our effective tax rate was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
our effective rate is impacted by the non controlling interests of the companies we consolidate  as we recognize of their income or loss in continuing operations before income taxes and non controlling interests 
however  we only provide an income tax provision or benefit for our portion of subsidiaries income or loss with a non controlling interest 
income from continuing operations including noncontrolling interests as a result of the foregoing  income from continuing operations including noncontrolling interests was million for fiscal year versus million for fiscal year discontinued operations during fiscal year  we closed our remaining retail store and warehouse operations and reclassified all retail related results as discontinued operations 
as a result of these closings and certain other retail store and real estate property closings from prior years  we had income from discontinued operations  net of taxes  of million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year ten properties classified as discontinued operations were sold during fiscal year  resulting in a gain  net of taxes  of million 
we sold or disposed of five former retail store locations classified as discontinued operations in fiscal year  as a result  we had a gain from disposal of discontinued operations  net of taxes  of million in fiscal year we expect income from discontinued operations to decline in future periods as our extended service plan activities wind down 
noncontrolling interests income or loss related to noncontrolling interests was million and million during fiscal years and  respectively  and represents the owners other than us share of the income or loss of levelland hockley and one earth 
noncontrolling interests of levelland hockley and one earth was million and million  respectively during fiscal year and million and million  respectively during fiscal year net income attributable to rex common shareholders as a result of the foregoing  net income attributable to rex common shareholders was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year business segment results during fiscal year  we realigned our reportable business segments to be consistent with changes to our management structure and reporting 
we now have two segments alternative energy and real estate 
the real estate segment was formerly included in the retail segment 
for former retail stores and warehouses closed which we have a retained interest in the related real estate  operations are now presented in the real estate segment based upon when retail operations ceased 
historical results from retail store operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the following sections discuss the results of operations for each of our business segments and corporate and other 
as discussed in note  our chief operating decision maker as defined by accounting standards codification asc segment reporting evaluates the operating performance of our business segments using a measure we call segment profit 
segment profit excludes income taxes  interest expense  discontinued operations  indirect interest income and certain other items that are included in net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management believes these are useful financial measures  however  they should not be construed as being more important than other comparable gaap measures 
items excluded from segment profit generally result from decisions made by corporate executives 
financing  divestiture and tax structure decisions are generally made by corporate executives 
excluding these items from our business segment performance measure enables us to evaluate business segment operating performance based upon current economic conditions 
amounts in the corporate category below include business activities that are not separately reportable and income from synthetic fuel investments 
amounts in thousands years ended january  net sales and revenues alternative energy real estate total net sales and revenues segment gross profit loss alternative energy real estate total gross profit segment profit loss alternative energy segment real estate corporate expenses interest expense interest income income from synthetic fuel investments income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interests alternative energy the alternative energy segment includes the consolidated financial results of levelland hockley and one earth  our other investments in ethanol facilities  the income or loss related to those investments and certain administrative expenses 
one earth began limited production operations late in the second quarter of fiscal year and became fully operational during the third quarter of fiscal year effective january   we sold a portion of our ownership interest in levelland hockley 
as a result  we no longer have a controlling financial interest in levelland hockley  and therefore  we deconsolidated levelland hockley effective january  and we will use the equity method of accounting on a prospective basis 
the results of levelland hockley are consolidated in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows during fiscal years  and however  the assets  liabilities and equity of levelland hockley are deconsolidated in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of january  the following table summarizes sales from levelland hockley and one earth by product group amounts in thousands years ended january  ethanol dried distiller grains wet distiller grains other total the following table summarizes selected operating data from levelland hockley and one earth years ended january  average selling price per gallon of ethanol average selling price per ton of dried distiller grains average selling price per ton of wet distiller grains average cost per bushel of grain average cost of natural gas per mmbtu net sales and revenue for the current year increased approximately million over the prior year to approximately million  primarily as a result of one earth becoming fully operational during the third quarter of fiscal year ethanol sales increased from approximately million in the prior year to approximately million in the current year 
the average selling price per gallon of ethanol increased from in the prior year to in the current year 
our ethanol sales were based upon approximately million gallons in the current year compared to approximately million gallons in the prior year 
dried distiller grains sales increased from approximately million in the prior year to approximately million in the current year 
the average selling price per ton of dried distiller grains increased from in the prior year to in the current year 
our dried distiller grains sales were based upon approximately  tons in the current year compared to approximately  tons in the prior year 
wet distiller grains sales decreased from approximately million in the prior year to approximately million in the current year 
the average selling price per ton of wet distiller grains decreased from in the prior year to in the current year 
our wet distiller grains sales were based upon approximately  tons in the current year compared to approximately  tons in the prior year 
we expect that sales in future periods will be based upon the following one earth energy only product annual sales quantity ethanol million to million gallons dried distiller grains  to  tons wet distiller grains  to  tons this expectation assumes that one earth will continue to operate at or near nameplate capacity  which is dependent upon the crush spread realized 
this expectation also assumes that we will not consolidate any other ethanol plants 
gross profit from alternative energy segment sales was approximately million during the current year compared to approximately million during the prior year 
gross profit improved primarily because of the volume increases in ethanol and distillers grains sold discussed above which was offset slightly by a less favorable spread between ethanol and grain prices in the current year compared to the prior year 
grain accounted for approximately million of our cost of sales during the current year compared to million during the prior year 
natural gas accounted for approximately million of our cost of sales during the current year compared to million during the prior year 
given the inherent volatility in ethanol and grain prices  we cannot predict the trend of the spread between ethanol and grain prices in future periods compared to historical periods 
we attempt to match quantities of ethanol and distillers grains sale contracts with an appropriate quantity of grain purchase contracts over a given period of time when we can obtain an adequate gross margin resulting from the crush spread inherent in the contracts we have executed 
however  the market for future ethanol sales contracts is not a mature market 
consequently  we generally execute contracts for no more than three months into the future at any given time 
as a result of the relatively short period of time our contracts cover  we generally cannot predict the future movements in the crush spread for more than three months 
approximately of our forecasted ethanol and distillers grain production during the next months has been sold under fixed price contracts 
as a result of these positions  the effect of a adverse change in the price of ethanol from the current pricing would result in a decrease in revenues of approximately million 
similarly  approximately of our estimated corn usage for the next months was subject to fixed price contracts 
as a result of these positions  the effect of a adverse change in the price of corn from current pricing would result in an increase in cost of goods of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million in fiscal year  a million increase from approximately million in fiscal year we recognized higher selling expenses of approximately million at one earth as one earth was in production for the full year in fiscal year we also recognized a charge of approximately million related to adjusting the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with the nugen acquisition 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses in future periods to remain consistent with comparable historical periods 
interest expense increased approximately million in the current year over the prior year to approximately million  as we no longer capitalize interest on the one earth credit facility subsequent to the completion of construction and commencement of operations at the plant 
in addition  one earth borrowed approximately million during fiscal year  the resulting higher outstanding debt amount also contributed to the increase in interest expense 
based on current interest rates  we expect interest expense to be in the range of million to million in fiscal year based on current debt levels and that we do not anticipate capitalizing significant amounts of interest now that all facilities are in operation 
income from equity method investments in big river  patriot and nugen increased from approximately million in the prior year to approximately million in the current year 
we recognized approximately million of income from big river in fiscal year which is approximately million above the prior year amount of approximately million 
big river benefited in the current year from a full year of production at its big river galva and big river united energy facilities during fiscal year we recognized approximately million of income from patriot in fiscal year  which is approximately million higher than the approximately million in the prior year 
patriot experienced a decline in interest expense of approximately million  as its term debt is variable rate debt  and interest rates declined in fiscal year patriot also recognized a gain on the early extinguishment of debt of approximately million 
we recognized approximately million of income from nugen in the current year 
this was the first year we reported income from nugen given that the acquisition of our interest in nugen was effective july given the inherent volatility in the factors that affect the crush spread  we cannot predict the likelihood that the trend with respect to income from equity method investments will continue in future periods 
losses on derivative financial instruments held by one earth and levelland were approximately million in the current year compared to approximately million in the prior year 
since the gains or losses on these derivative financial instruments are primarily a function of the movement in interest rates  we cannot predict the likelihood that such gains or losses in future periods will be consistent with current year results 
as a result of the factors discussed above  segment profit decreased to million in the current year from million in the prior year 
real estate the real estate segment includes all owned and sub leased real estate including those previously used as retail store and distribution center operations  our real estate leasing activities and certain administrative expenses 
it excludes results from discontinued operations 
at january   we had lease agreements  as landlord  for all or parts of eight owned former retail stores  square feet leased and  square feet vacant 
we have owned former retail stores  square feet  that are vacant at january  we are marketing these vacant properties to lease or sell 
in addition  one former distribution center is partially leased  square feet  partially occupied by our corporate office personnel  square feet and partially vacant  square feet 
net sales and revenue for the current year increased approximately million over the prior year to approximately million 
the increase in revenue is primarily a result of a lease for a portion of a distribution center that was executed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year gross loss from this segment was approximately million during the current year compared to approximately million during the prior year 
gross loss improved as a result of the increase in revenue discussed above 
we expect lease revenue in fiscal year to be consistent with fiscal year based upon leases currently executed 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately  in fiscal year  consistent with the  in fiscal year we expect selling  general and administrative expenses in future periods to remain consistent with comparable historical periods 
as a result of the factors discussed above  segment loss was approximately million in the current year compared to approximately million in the prior year 
excluding any property sales that may occur in fiscal year  we expect to generate another segment loss in fiscal year based upon the current number of vacant properties 
corporate and other corporate and other includes certain administrative expenses of the corporate headquarters  interest expense and interest income not directly allocated to the alternative energy or real estate segments and income from synthetic fuel investments 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million in the current year compared to approximately million in the prior year 
professional fees increased approximately million over the prior year 
the remainder of the fluctuation results from increases in most general and administrative categories 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses in future periods to be consistent with current year levels 
interest expense of approximately million in the current year is consistent with prior year expense 
interest income of approximately million in the current year is consistent with prior year income 
comparison of fiscal years ended january  and net sales and revenue net sales and revenue in fiscal year were approximately million  a million increase from approximately million in fiscal year net sales and revenue do not include sales from retail and real estate operations classified in discontinued operations 
the increase was primarily caused by higher sales in our alternative energy segment of approximately million 
net sales and revenue from our real estate segment of approximately  were consistent with the prior year amount of approximately  gross profit gross profit was approximately million in fiscal year versus approximately million for fiscal year this represents an increase of approximately million 
gross profit for fiscal year increased by approximately million over the prior year as a result of operations in the alternative energy segment 
our real estate segment had gross loss for fiscal year of approximately million compared to gross profit of approximately million in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year were approximately million  consistent with the approximately million for fiscal year interest income interest income decreased to approximately million for fiscal year from approximately million for fiscal year the decline generally results from lower yields earned on our excess cash in the current year compared to the prior year 
the lower yields are a result of the overall macroeconomic environment and not a result of a shift to investments with less risk 
interest expense interest expense increased to approximately million for fiscal year from approximately million for fiscal year the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the alternative energy segment as we had higher amounts of average debt outstanding upon the completion of one earth s ethanol plant 
loss on early termination of debt during fiscal year  we completed the early payoff of approximately million of mortgage debt prior to maturity 
as a result  we expensed certain unamortized financing costs and prepayment penalties of approximately  as loss on early termination of debt 
equity in income of unconsolidated ethanol affiliates during fiscal years and  we recognized income of approximately million and approximately million  respectively from our equity investments in big river and patriot 
big river operates an ethanol facility with a nameplate capacity of million gallons 
patriot completed construction of its ethanol facility with a nameplate capacity of million gallons during the second quarter of fiscal year income from big river was approximately million and approximately million in fiscal years and  respectively 
we recorded income of approximately million and a loss of approximately million from patriot in fiscal years and  respectively 
patriot benefited in fiscal year from a full year of production and favorable crush spreads  particularly during the latter half of calendar year income from synthetic fuel investments results for fiscal year reflect the impact of our equity investment in two limited partnerships  colona and somerset  which produced synthetic fuels 
we recognized income from the sales of our interests in colona and somerset subject to certain annual limitations and production levels 
the section k tax credit program expired on december  the income recognized in fiscal year represents the final settlements related to colona and somerset as all synthetic fuel production ceased during fiscal year we do not anticipate additional income or loss from the sales of our colona and somerset partnership interests 
we also sold our membership interest in the limited liability company that owned a synthetic fuel facility in gillette  wyoming 
the plant was subsequently sold and during the third quarter of fiscal year  we modified our agreement with the owners and operators of the synthetic fuel facility 
based on the terms of the modified agreement  we currently are not able to predict the likelihood and timing of collecting payments related to production occurring after september  thus  we cannot currently predict the timing of income recognition  if any  related to production occurring subsequent to september  other income during fiscal year  levelland hockley entered into an agreement to settle litigation and received million as a condition of the settlement 
of the proceeds received  approximately million was recognized as other income during fiscal year during fiscal year  levelland hockley received notification from the united states department of agriculture that levelland hockley had been approved to receive funds under the advanced biofuel producer program 
as a result  approximately million was recognized as other income during fiscal year losses on derivative financial instruments we recognized losses of million and million during fiscal years and  respectively  related to forward interest rate swaps that levelland hockley and one earth entered into during fiscal year during fiscal year  levelland hockley s loss was million and one earth s loss was million 
during fiscal year  levelland hockley s loss was million and one earth s loss was million 
income taxes our effective tax rate was a provision of and a benefit of for fiscal years and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate in fiscal years and  as the noncontrolling interests in the income or loss of consolidated subsidiaries is presented in the statement of operations after income tax benefit or provision 
loss income from continuing operations including noncontrolling interests as a result of the foregoing  income from continuing operations including noncontrolling interests was approximately million for fiscal year versus a loss of approximately million for fiscal year discontinued operations during fiscal year  we closed our remaining retail store and warehouse operations and reclassified them as discontinued operations 
as a result of these closings and certain other retail store and real estate property closings from prior years  we had income from discontinued operations  net of tax benefit  of approximately million in fiscal year compared to a loss of approximately million in fiscal year we sold or abandoned five properties classified as discontinued operations in fiscal year compared to selling properties in fiscal year as a result  we had a gain from disposal of discontinued operations  net of a tax provision  of approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year noncontrolling interests income loss related to noncontrolling interests of approximately million and approximately million for fiscal years and  respectively  represents the owners other than us share of the income or loss of levelland hockley and one earth 
noncontrolling interests of levelland hockley and one earth was approximately million and approximately million  respectively during fiscal year and approximately million and approximately million  respectively during fiscal year net loss income attributable to rex common shareholders as a result of the foregoing  net income attributable to rex common shareholders was approximately million for fiscal year versus net loss of approximately million for fiscal year in addition to the information discussed above  the following sections discuss the results of operations for each of our business segments and corporate and other 
alternative energy the alternative energy segment includes the consolidated financial statements of levelland hockley and one earth  our other investments in ethanol facilities  the income related to those investments and certain administrative expenses 
fiscal year was the first year that this segment had sales as levelland hockley commenced production operations during the second quarter of fiscal year one earth began limited production operations late in the second quarter of fiscal year and became fully operational during the third quarter of fiscal year the following table summarizes sales from levelland hockley and one earth by product group amounts in thousands years ended january  ethanol dried distiller grains wet distiller grains other total the following table summarizes selected operating data from levelland hockley and one earth years ended january  average selling price per gallon of ethanol average selling price per ton of dried distiller grains average selling price per ton of wet distiller grains average cost per bushel of grain average cost of natural gas per mmbtu net sales and revenue for the current year increased by million over the prior year to million  primarily a result of one earth becoming fully operational during the third quarter of fiscal year the average selling price per gallon of ethanol declined from in the prior year to in the current year 
our sales were based upon million gallons of ethanol in the current year compared to million gallons in the prior year 
gross profit from these sales was approximately million during fiscal year compared to approximately million during the fiscal year gross profit improved primarily as a result of one earth beginning operations in fiscal year the crush spread realized improved during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  which is when one earth began operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million in fiscal year  a million decrease from approximately million in fiscal year we incurred a non cash impairment charge of million in fiscal year related to the write off of goodwill associated with levelland hockley 
we also incurred approximately million in increased expenses during fiscal year related to the start of operations at one earth 
interest expense increased approximately million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year to approximately million  as we no longer capitalize interest on the one earth credit facility subsequent to the commencement of operations at the plant 
in addition  one earth borrowed approximately million during fiscal year  the resulting higher outstanding debt amount also contributed to the increase in interest expense 
other income increased approximately million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase is a result of levelland hockley recognizing a legal settlement of approximately million and grant income of approximately million in fiscal year income from equity method investments in big river and patriot increased from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year we recognized approximately million of income from our investment in big river in fiscal year which is consistent with the fiscal year amount of approximately million 
we recognized approximately million of income from our investment in patriot in fiscal year  which is approximately million higher than the loss of approximately million in fiscal year the fluctuation related to income from patriot is primarily a result of the start up of production in fiscal year patriot was in production for approximately four months during fiscal year losses on derivative financial instruments held by one earth and levelland were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year as a result of the factors discussed above  segment profit increased to approximately million in fiscal year from a loss of approximately million in fiscal year real estate the real estate segment includes all owned and sub leased real estate including those previously used as retail store and distribution center operations  our real estate leasing activities and certain administrative expenses 
it excludes results from discontinued operations 
at january   we had lease or sub lease agreements  as landlord  for all or parts of ten former retail stores  square feet leased and  square feet vacant 
we own nine of these properties and are the tenant sub landlord for one of the properties 
we have owned former retail stores  square feet  and one former distribution center  square feet  that are vacant at january  we are marketing these vacant properties to lease or sell 
in addition  one former distribution center is partially leased  square feet  partially occupied by our corporate office personnel  square feet and partially vacant  square feet 
net sales and revenue for fiscal year of approximately million increased approximately million over the fiscal year amount of approximately million 
the increase in revenue is primarily a result of properties leased to appliance direct for a portion of fiscal year gross loss from this segment was approximately million during fiscal year compared to gross profit of approximately million during fiscal year gross loss increased as a result of the higher levels of vacant properties 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately  in fiscal year  consistent with the approximately  in fiscal year as a result of the factors discussed above  segment loss increased to a loss of approximately million in fiscal year from segment profit of approximately million in fiscal year corporate and other there was no income from synthetic fuel investments in fiscal year  compared to approximately million in fiscal year the income recognized in fiscal year represents the estimated final settlements related to colona and somerset as all synthetic fuel production ceased during fiscal year we do not expect additional income or loss from the colona and somerset partnership sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million in fiscal year  consistent with the approximately million of expenses in fiscal year interest expense of approximately million in fiscal year is consistent with the expense in fiscal year interest income was approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year the decrease generally results from lower yields earned on our excess cash 
the lower yields are a result of the overall macroeconomic environment and not a result of shift to investments with less risk 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of financing have been income from operations  sales of real estate and debt financing 
our primary uses of cash have been equity and debt investments in ethanol entities  construction of ethanol plants  long term debt repayments and stock repurchases 
outlook our cash balance of approximately million includes approximately million held by one earth 
pursuant to its debt agreement  one earth is limited with respect to paying dividends 
thus  we expect that one earth will use a majority of its cash for working capital needs 
all of our ethanol investments have significant amounts of long term debt and we expect these organizations to limit the payment of dividends based upon working capital needs  debt service requirements and the requirements of their respective loan agreements 
we continue to investigate investment opportunities in various companies and industries 
other possible uses of our excess cash are to pay down long term mortgage debt and repurchase our common stock 
in general  we will pay down long term debt when the interest rate environment is unfavorable as it relates to the type of debt fixed rate versus variable rate and if the specific debt does not contain significant prepayment penalties 
such pay downs are carried out at levels that do not impede on other cash requirements we may have  such as investments in prospective entities we are investigating 
we typically repurchase our common stock when our stock price is trading at prices we deem to be a discount to the underlying value of our net assets 
such purchases are carried out at levels that do not impede on other cash requirements we may have  such as prospective investments in entities we are investigating 
historically  we have not incurred additional borrowings under our debt agreements to fund repurchases of our common stock 
we also plan to seek and evaluate other various investment opportunities including energy related  agricultural or other ventures we believe fit our investment criteria 
we can make no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to find such opportunities 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we are expecting our financial performance from our ethanol plants to decline compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year excluding the impairment charges and loss on deconsolidation related to levelland hockley as the crush spread has decreased from levels 
the near month crush spread determined by information on cbot averaged approximately per gallon of ethanol during the first quarter of fiscal year compared to approximately per gallon of ethanol during calendar year however  this trend has been partially offset by increases in the selling price of distillers grains 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year for fiscal year  operating cash flow was provided by net income of approximately million including the impact of levelland hockley related impairment charges and the loss on deconsolidation of approximately million  real estate impairment charges of approximately million and non cash items of approximately million  which consist of deferred income  the deferred income tax provision  gain on disposal of real estate and property and equipment  income from ethanol investments  and depreciation and amortization 
cash was provided by dividends received from our equity method investees as returns on investment of approximately million  primarily a result of increased profitability at these entities 
additionally  cash was provided by a refund on income taxes of approximately million resulting from net operating losses carried back to prior years 
accounts receivable increased approximately million  primarily a result of the timing of products shipped and the receipt of customer payments at one earth 
prepaid expense and other assets increased approximately million  primarily as a result of an increase in property taxes receivable that one earth pays and then receives a partial rebate from various taxing authorities in connection with a tax increment financing district 
other liabilities decreased approximately million  primarily a result of payments we made related to our contingent consideration liability associated with the nugen acquisition 
other long term assets increased approximately million  primarily a result of an increase in property taxes receivable that one earth pays and then receives a partial rebate from various taxing authorities in connection with a tax increment financing district and an increase in various deposits one earth is required to maintain with utility vendors 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for fiscal year for fiscal year  operating cash flow was provided by net income of approximately million adjusted for the impact of impairment charges of million and non cash items of million  which consist of deferred income  the deferred income tax provision  gain on disposal of real estate and property and equipment  income from ethanol investments  and depreciation and amortization 
cash was provided by a decrease in inventory of approximately million  primarily due to our exit of the retail business 
additionally  cash was provided by a decrease in other assets of approximately million  primarily a result of prepaid commissions related to extended service contracts decreasing  reflecting our lower sales of this service 
accounts payable decreased approximately million  primarily a result of our exit of the retail business 
income taxes refundable increased approximately million as a result of an income tax loss carryback created during fiscal year other liabilities decreased approximately million  as accruals for costs associated with our exit of the retail business were paid in fiscal year accounts receivable increased approximately million  this was primarily a result of one earth commencing production operations in fiscal year investing activities net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for fiscal year compared to approximately million for fiscal year capital expenditures in fiscal year totaled approximately million  the majority of which was for the construction of additional corn storage at one earth s ethanol plant 
we used cash of approximately million for our acquisition of nugen 
cash of approximately million was provided by proceeds from the sale of real estate and property and equipment 
we received cash of approximately million as patriot repaid the remaining balance on their note payable to us 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal year capital expenditures in fiscal year totaled million  the majority of which was for the construction of one earth s ethanol plant 
cash of million was provided by proceeds from the sale of real estate and property and equipment 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for fiscal year compared to cash provided of approximately million for fiscal year during fiscal year  repayments of debt totaled approximately million 
stock option exercises in fiscal year generated cash of approximately million 
during fiscal year  we purchased approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately million in open market transactions 
cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal year during fiscal year  we borrowed million in long term debt 
one earth accounted for all of the borrowing as one earth used loan proceeds to complete construction of its ethanol plant 
repayments of debt totaled million during fiscal year stock option exercises in fiscal year generated cash of million 
during fiscal year  we purchased approximately million shares of our common stock for million in open market transactions 
at january   we had a remaining authorization from our board of directors to purchase  shares of our common stock 
we plan to hold all acquired shares in treasury for possible future use 
at january   we had approximately million of debt outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of  with maturities from august to november during fiscal year  we paid off approximately million of long term mortgage debt from scheduled repayments and early payoffs 
during fiscal year  we paid off approximately million of long term mortgage debt from scheduled repayments and early payoffs 
one earth subsidiary level debt in september  one earth entered into a  financing agreement consisting of a construction loan agreement for  together with a  revolving loan and a  letter of credit with first national bank of omaha 
the construction loan was converted into a term loan on july  the term loan bears interest at variable interest rates ranging from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points to at january  
beginning with the first quarterly payment on october   payments are due in quarterly payments of principal plus accrued interest with the principal portion calculated based on a month amortization schedule 
one final installment will be required on the maturity date july  for the remaining unpaid principal balance with accrued interest 
this debt is recourse only to one earth and not to rex american resources corporation or any of its other subsidiaries 
borrowings are secured by all property of one earth 
as of january   approximately million was outstanding on the term loan 
one earth is also subject to certain financial covenants under the loan agreement  including required levels of ebitda  debt service coverage ratio requirements  net worth requirements and other common covenants 
one earth was in compliance with all covenants at january  one earth paid approximately  in costs related to obtaining its financing arrangement 
these costs are recorded as prepaid loan fees and are being amortized over the loan term 
at january   our proportionate share of restricted assets related to one earth was approximately million 
one earth s restricted assets total approximately million 
such assets may not be paid in the form of dividends or advances to the parent company or other members of one earth per the terms of the loan agreement with first national bank of omaha 
one earth has no outstanding borrowings on the  revolving loan as of january  one earth also has access to a secondary line of credit of up to  with first national bank of omaha  established as part of the original  term loan and made accessible as a revolving line of credit as term loan payments were made 
the amount available is reduced by  on a quarterly basis 
at january  and  one earth had  and  respectively  on the secondary line of credit available on this revolving line of credit 
one earth does not have any borrowings on the secondary line of credit at january  or one earth has issued letters of credit that total approximately million at january  on a consolidated basis  approximately of our net assets including equity method investees are restricted as of january  including only our consolidated subsidiaries  approximately of our net assets are restricted as of january  tabular disclosure of contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business  we enter into agreements under which we are obligated to make legally enforceable future cash payments 
these agreements include obligations related to purchasing inventory  long term debt and interest rate management 
the following table summarizes by category expected future cash outflows associated with contractual obligations in effect as of january  amounts in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years lease obligations long term debt obligations interest on variable rate debt a interest on fixed rate debt other b total c a the interest rates effective as of january  for variable rate loans were used to calculate future payments of interest on variable rate debt 
b amounts represent primarily payment due for rail car usage contracts at one earth energy 
c we are not able to determine the likely settlement period for uncertain tax positions  accordingly approximately million of uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties have been excluded from the table above 
we are not able to determine the likely settlement period  if any  for interest rate swaps  accordingly approximately million of liabilities for derivative financial instruments have been excluded from the table above 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the impact of seasonal and quarterly fluctuations has not been material to our results of operations for the past three fiscal years 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation has not been material to our results of operations for the past three fiscal years 
critical accounting policies we believe the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  require significant assumptions  judgments and estimates on the part of management 
we base our assumptions  judgments  and estimates on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
further  if different assumptions  judgments and estimates had been used  the results could have been different and such differences could be material 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize sales from ethanol and distillers grains when title transfers to customers  upon shipment from our plant 
shipping and handling charges to ethanol customers are included in net sales and revenue 
we include income from our real estate leasing activities in net sales and revenue 
we account for these leases as operating leases 
accordingly  minimum rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
we sold retail product service contracts covering periods beyond the normal manufacturers warranty periods  usually with terms of coverage including manufacturers warranty periods of between to months 
contract revenues and sales commissions are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the contracts after the expiration of applicable manufacturers warranty periods 
we retain the obligation to perform warranty service and such costs are charged to operations as incurred 
all related revenue and expense is classified in discontinued operations 
we recognized income from synthetic fuel partnership sales as the synthetic fuel was produced and sold except for operations at the gillette facility as we do not believe that collection of our proceeds for production occurring subsequent to september  is reasonably assured from that plant 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of synthetic fuel partnership sales 
investments the method of accounting applied to long term investments  whether consolidated  equity or cost  involves an evaluation of the significant terms of each investment that explicitly grant or suggest evidence of control or influence over the operations of the investee and also includes the identification of any variable interests in which we are the primary beneficiary 
the evaluation of consolidation under asc consolidation is complex and requires judgments to be made 
we consolidated the results of two majority owned subsidiaries  levelland hockley and one earth  on a one month lag during fiscal year as a result of losing control of levelland hockley at the end of fiscal year  we deconsolidated the subsidiary s balance sheet and will apply the equity method of accounting prospectively 
investments in businesses that we do not control  or maintain a majority voting interest or maintain a primary beneficial interest  but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial matters  are accounted for using the equity method 
investments in which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial matters are accounted for using the cost method 
investments in debt securities are considered held to maturity  available for sale  or trading securities under asc  investments debt and equity securities 
under asc  held to maturity securities are required to be carried at their cost  while available for sale securities are required to be carried at their fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of income taxes  that are considered temporary in nature recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the fair values of our investments in debt securities are determined based upon market quotations and various valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow analysis 
we periodically evaluate our investments for impairment due to declines in market value considered to be other than temporary 
such impairment evaluations include  in addition to persistent  declining market prices  general economic and company specific evaluations 
if we determine that a decline in market value is other than temporary  then a charge to earnings is recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for all or a portion of the unrealized loss  and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
inventory reserves inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market 
the market value of inventory is often dependent upon fluctuating commodity prices 
if these estimates are inaccurate  we may be exposed to market conditions that require an additional reduction in the value of certain inventories affected 
we provide an inventory reserve  which is treated as a permanent write down of inventory  for inventory items that have a cost greater than net realizable value 
no inventory reserve was recorded at january  and approximately million was recorded at january  fluctuations in the inventory reserve generally relate to the levels and composition of such inventory at a given point in time 
assumptions we use to estimate the necessary reserve have not significantly changed over the last three fiscal years other than we no longer provide a reserve for obsolete retail inventory as this inventory was liquidated during fiscal year the assumptions we currently use include our estimates of the selling prices of ethanol and distillers grains 
financial instruments forward grain purchase and ethanol sale contracts are accounted for under the normal purchases and normal sales scope exemption of asc  derivatives and hedging because these arrangements are for purchases of grain and sales of ethanol that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used by us over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage our balance of fixed and variable rate debt 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments and do not represent an actual exchange of the notional amounts between the parties 
our swap agreements were not designated for hedge accounting pursuant to asc the interest rate swaps are recorded at their fair values and the changes in fair values are recorded as gain or loss on derivative financial instruments in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes income taxes are recorded based on the current year amounts payable or refundable  as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes  net of valuation allowances 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing regulatory tax laws and rates and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
we have established valuation allowances for certain state net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
we determined that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in future years to allow for the full utilization of the federal amt credit carryforward and other deferred tax assets other than those reserved 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  we have assumed that our ethanol plants and real estate assets will begin generating taxable income by fiscal year we are projecting that the operations of one earth that began in fiscal year will continue to be profitable 
we are assuming that we will be relatively successful in our real estate marketing efforts 
in addition  we have considered the fact that our amt credit carryforward has an indefinite life 
in general  we have used approximately million as the assumed average of future years pre tax income 
we believe our assumed target level of earnings is reasonable based upon expectations of real estate rental income and ethanol plant operating income 
in addition  we considered other positive factors in our assessment 
although during fiscal years  and we realized a taxable loss  historically  we have generated cumulative profitability over the past several years and expect to begin producing taxable income by fiscal year through our ethanol and real estate operations 
furthermore  the taxable loss is attributable  in large part  to accelerated depreciation deductions for income tax purposes 
such deductions are not expected to continue at levels we have seen in the last three years 
in addition  we have significant financial resources to deploy in future income producing activities 
the valuation allowance was approximately million and approximately million at january  and january   respectively 
should estimates of future income differ significantly from our prior estimates  we could be required to make a material change to our deferred tax valuation allowance 
the primary assumption used to estimate the valuation allowance has been estimates of future state taxable income 
such estimates can have material variations from year to year based upon expected levels of income from our ethanol plants  leasing income and gains on real estate sales 
factors that could negatively affect future taxable income include adverse changes in the commercial real estate market and the ethanol crush spread 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates 
we adopted the provisions of asc for uncertain tax positions on february  as a result of the adoption of this accounting standard  we recorded a million decrease to retained earnings 
as of january   total unrecognized tax benefits were approximately million  and accrued penalties and interest were approximately million 
if we were to prevail on all unrecognized tax benefits recorded  approximately million of the reserve would benefit the effective tax rate 
in addition  the impact of penalties and interest would also benefit the effective tax rate 
interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits are recorded within income tax expense 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit with respect to certain unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease during the next months  however  we do not expect the change to have a material effect on results of operations or financial position 
on a quarterly and annual basis  we accrue for the effects of open uncertain tax positions and the related potential penalties and interest 
should future estimates of open uncertain tax positions differ from our current estimates  we could be required to make a material change to our accrual for uncertain tax positions 
in addition  new income tax audit findings could also require us to make a material change to our accrual for uncertain tax positions 
recoverability of long lived assets given the nature of our business  each income producing property must be evaluated separately when events and circumstances indicate that the value of that asset may not be recoverable 
we recognize an impairment loss when the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 
we generally use expected future cash flows on a discounted basis and appraisals of specific properties to estimate fair value 
changes in the real estate market for particular locations could result in changes to our estimates of the property s value upon disposal 
in addition  changes in expected future cash flows from our ethanol plants could result in additional impairment charges 
any adverse change in the spread between ethanol and grain prices could result in additional impairment charges 
costs associated with exit activities and restructuring costs restructuring charges included severance and associated employee termination costs  lease termination fees and other costs associated with the exit of our retail business 
we recorded severance and associated employee termination costs pursuant to asc  asc and asc asc requires that lease termination fees  net of expected sublease rental income  be recorded once the leased facility is no longer actively used in a revenue producing manner 
future changes to our estimates of employee layoffs or leased stores abandoned are unlikely to have a material impact on our restructuring accrual 
at january   we have an accrual of approximately million for costs related to restructuring 
new accounting pronouncements effective february   we will be required to adopt the second phase of the amended guidance in asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  which will require us to disclose information in the reconciliation of recurring level measurements about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis  separately for assets and liabilities 
the adoption of this amended guidance will require expanded disclosure in the consolidated financial statements but will not impact financial results 
there were no other new accounting standards issued during fiscal year that had or are expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations associated with interest rates and commodity prices as discussed below 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
exposure to interest rate risk results primarily from holding term and revolving loans that bear variable interest rates 
specifically  we have approximately million in variable rate debt as of january  interest rates on our variable rate debt are determined based upon the market interest rate of libor plus to basis points 
a adverse change for example from to in market interest rates would affect our interest cost on such debt by approximately million per year in the aggregate 
one earth entered into two forward interest rate swaps in the notional amounts of million and million with the first national bank of omaha during fiscal years and the million swap fixed the variable interest rate of a portion of one earth s term loan at  while the million swap fixed the variable interest rate of a portion of one earth s term loan at 
the swap settlements commenced on july   the million swap terminates on july  and the million swap terminates on july  a hypothetical change for example  from to in market interest rates at january  would change the fair value of the interest rate swaps by approximately million 
commodity price risk we manage a portion of our risk with respect to the volatility of commodity prices inherent in the ethanol industry by using forward purchase and sale contracts 
one earth has purchase commitments for approximately million bushels of corn  the principal raw material for its ethanol plant 
one earth expects to take delivery of the corn by april one earth has sales commitments for approximately million gallons of ethanol and  tons of distillers grains 
one earth expects to deliver the ethanol and distillers grains by april approximately of our forecasted ethanol production during the next months has been sold under fixed price contracts 
as a result  the effect of a adverse move in the price of ethanol from the current pricing would result in a decrease in annual revenues of approximately million for the remaining of forecasted ethanol production 
similarly  approximately of our estimated corn usage for the next month was subject to fixed price contracts 
as a result  the effect of a adverse move in the price of corn for current pricing would result in an increase in annual cost of goods sold of approximately million for the remaining of forecasted corn usage
