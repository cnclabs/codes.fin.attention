item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of december  and  and for the years ended december    and included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
see also cautionary note regarding forward looking statements preceding part i of this report and risk factors set forth in item a 
of this report 
overview we are a fully integrated  self managed real estate investment trust specializing in the acquisition  ownership  management  development  and disposition of primarily high quality class a office buildings located in major us office markets and leased primarily to high credit quality tenants 
we operate as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes 
since our formation in  we have completed four public offerings of common stock 
combined with our dividend reinvestment plan  these offerings raised approximately billion in total offering proceeds 
the proceeds from these sales of common stock  net of offering costs and other expenses  were used primarily to fund the acquisition of real estate properties and certain capital expenditures identified at the time of acquisition  as well as to fund redemptions pursuant to our share redemption program 
on february   we listed our class a common stock on the nyse 
we completed our most recent public offering our first publicly listed offering  on february   selling million shares 
our anticipated sources of capital are i cash 
index to financial statements generated from operations  ii proceeds from our completed public offerings  iii borrowings under our existing million unsecured facility and any other future debt facilities  and iv proceeds from selective dispositions 
we filed an amendment to our charter to effect the recapitalization of our common stock on january  pursuant to the recapitalization  each share of our outstanding common stock was converted automatically into th of a share of our class a common stock  plus th of a share of our class b common stock  plus th of a share of our class b common stock  plus th of a share of our class b common stock 
all of our class b common stock had converted to class a common stock by january  the recapitalization also had the effect of reducing the total number of outstanding shares of our common stock 
the recapitalization was effected on a pro rata basis with respect to all of our stockholders 
accordingly  it did not affect any stockholder s proportionate ownership of our outstanding shares except for any changes resulting from the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares 
as of december   we owned and operated office properties excluding seven buildings owned through unconsolidated joint ventures and two industrial buildings  which are located in metropolitan areas 
these office properties comprise approximately million square feet  primarily class a commercial office space  and were approximately and leased as of december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we intend to use cash flows generated from the operation of our wholly owned properties and distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures  proceeds from our existing million unsecured facility  and proceeds from the recent sale of the sylvan avenue building as our primary sources of immediate and long term liquidity 
in addition  the potential selective disposal of existing properties and other financing opportunities such as issuance of additional equity or debt securities or additional borrowings from third party lenders afforded to us based on our relatively low leverage and quality asset base may also provide additional sources of capital  however  the availability and attractiveness of terms for these sources of capital is highly dependent on market conditions 
as of the time of this filing  we have no outstanding amounts under our million unsecured facility  therefore  we had the full capacity available for future borrowing with the exception of approximately million of capacity that is reserved as security for outstanding letters of credit required by various third parties 
we anticipate that our most immediate use of capital will be to fund capital expenditures for our existing portfolio of properties 
these expenditures include two types of specifically identified building improvement projects i general repair and maintenance projects that we as the owner may choose to perform at any of our various properties  and ii tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions negotiated as part of executed leases with our tenants 
the timing and magnitude of general repair and maintenance projects are subject to our discretion 
we anticipate funding approximately million in unrecorded contractual obligations for tenant improvements related to our existing lease portfolio over the respective lease term  much of which we estimate may be required to be funded over the next five years 
for many of our leases  the timing of the actual funding of these tenant improvements is largely dependent upon tenant requests for reimbursement 
in some cases  these obligations may expire with the leases without further recourse to us 
finally  projected amounts for tenant improvements and leasing commissions related to anticipated re leasing efforts are generally expected to increase in the near to medium term as a significant number of our leases are scheduled to expire over the next three years 
however  the timing and magnitude of these amounts are subject to change as competitive market conditions at the time of lease negotiations dictate 

index to financial statements subject to the availability of attractive properties and our ability to consummate additional acquisitions on satisfactory terms  acquiring new assets compatible with our investment strategy could also be a significant use of capital 
further  dependent upon actual disposition and acquisition activities  we currently anticipate that we will repay the full outstanding balance of the million unsecured term loan  which is the only near term debt maturity we have in  using availability under our million unsecured facility 
we also anticipate using funds to make other scheduled debt service payments and or debt repayments when such obligations become due 
our cash flows from operations depend significantly on market rents and the ability of our tenants to make rental payments 
while we believe the diversity and high credit quality of our tenants help mitigate the risk of a significant interruption of our cash flows from operations  the challenging economic conditions that we are currently experiencing  the downward pressure on rental rates in most of our markets  the potential for an increase in interest rates  or the possibility for a further downturn in one of our concentration markets  could adversely impact our operating cash flows 
our primary focus is to achieve an attractive long term  risk adjusted return for our stockholders 
competition to attract and retain high credit quality tenants remains intense due to general economic conditions 
at the same time  as mentioned above  a significant number of our leases at our properties are scheduled to expire over the next three years  and the capital requirements necessary to maintain our current occupancy levels  including payment of leasing commissions  tenant concessions  and anticipated leasing expenditures  could increase 
as such  we will continue to closely monitor our tenant renewals  rental rates  competitive market conditions  and our cash flows 
the amount and form of payment cash or stock issuance of future dividends to be paid to our stockholders will continue to be largely dependent upon i the amount of cash generated from our operating activities  ii our expectations of future cash flows  iii our determination of near term cash needs for debt repayments and selective acquisitions of new properties  iv the timing of significant expenditures for tenant improvements and general property capital improvements  v appropriate long term payout ratios for comparable companies  vi our ability to continue to access additional sources of capital and vii the amount required to be distributed to maintain our status as a reit 
given the fluctuating nature of cash flows and expenditures  we may periodically borrow funds on a short term basis to cover timing differences in cash collections and cash receipts 
although we covered the dividend out of operating cash flows in  slight declines in projected core ffo  coupled with increasing capital commitments for new leases  lead us to believe that we will likely not cover our dividend in and or we will closely monitor these projections and will consider adjusting our dividend policy accordingly 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  vs 
the year ended december  our income from continuing operations increased from to primarily due to the recognition of a non recurring impairment loss of approximately million in the prior year  lower operating expenses at several of our buildings  primarily related to lower estimated property tax assessments  the recognition of an additional million in other rental income related to lease terminations at certain of our properties  and lower interest expense due to a lower  fixed interest rate on the million term loan  as compared to the prior year 

index to financial statements the following table sets forth selected data from our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and  respectively  as well as each balance as a percentage of total revenues for the years presented dollars in millions december  december  increase decrease revenue rental income tenant reimbursements property management fee revenue other rental income total revenues expense property operating costs depreciation amortization impairment loss on real estate assets general and administrative expense real estate operating income other income expense interest expense interest and other income equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures income from continuing operations revenue rental income remained relatively flat for the year ended december   approximately million  as compared to the prior year  approximately million 
however  there was lower occupancy during the current period at our aon center building in chicago  illinois and the hidden lake circle building in duncan  south carolina 
the unfavorable decrease was largely offset by an increase in occupancy at our glenridge highlands two building in atlanta  georgia as well as our broad street building in new york  new york 
tenant reimbursements decreased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  of the decrease  approximately million is due to lower recoverable estimated property taxes as well as lower estimated tenant requested services 
the remaining variance is attributable to an overall reduction in recoverable expenses due to a partial lease termination at the aon center building 
other rental income is comprised primarily of income recognized for lease terminations and restructurings 
unlike the majority of our rental income  which is recognized ratably over long term contracts  other rental income is recognized once we have completed our obligation to provide space to the tenant 
lease terminations and restructurings of approximately million for the year ended december  relates primarily to a lease termination at our chandler forum building in chandler  arizona of approximately million  as well as lease terminations at our hidden lake circle building  aon center building and our eastpointe corporate center building located in issaquah  washington 
prior year other rental income relates primarily to leases terminated at the aon center building and the main street building in irvine  california of approximately million and million  respectively 
we do not expect such income to be comparable in future periods  as it will be dependent upon the exercise of lease terminations by tenants and or the execution of restructuring agreements that may either not be in our control  or are deemed by management to be in the best interest of the portfolio over the long term 

index to financial statements expense property operating costs decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
this variance is primarily the result of successful appeals of the assessed values at several of our buildings resulting in lower estimated property tax expense of approximately million 
lower recoverable tenant requested services ie billback expenses of approximately million also contributed to the year over year decrease 
depreciation expense decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the decrease in depreciation expense is largely due to an adjustment to accelerate depreciation expense on tenant improvements in the prior year related to various lease terminations at certain of our buildings  as well as lower depreciation expense in the current year related to the reclassification of the sylvan avenue building to held for sale in may  and its subsequent disposition in december the decrease was mostly offset by an increase in other tenant improvements placed in service after december  at various buildings within our portfolio  as well as the acquisition of three buildings in the latter half of amortization expense decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the decrease primarily relates to lease intangible assets that have fully amortized subsequent to january   resulting in less amortization of approximately million  as well as a decrease in adjustments to accelerate amortization expense on certain lease intangible assets related to various lease terminations at certain of our buildings compared to the prior year of approximately million 
however  this decrease during the current period was partially offset by an increase in amortization related to new deferred lease acquisition costs associated with the acquisition or renewal of tenants subsequent to december   which are amortized over the life of the respective leases 
we did not recognize an impairment loss on our held for use  wholly owned buildings during the current year  however  during the year ended december   we recognized an impairment loss of approximately million as a result of lowering expected future rental income and reducing the intended holding periods for the auburn hills corporate center building in auburn hills  michigan  and the west long lake road building in troy  michigan  as well as the durham avenue building in south plainfield  new jersey 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the variance is primarily attributable to an increase in transfer agent expenses associated with our recent recapitalization  listing of our shares on the new york stock exchange  and related investor support services of approximately million 
also  we incurred higher employee benefit costs of approximately million  primarily due to the new stock performance component of the long term incentive compensation plan which effects long term incentive compensation grants for officers and resulted in earlier recognition of expense as compared to the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by insurance recoveries related to our defense of ongoing litigation during the current period 
other income expense interest expense decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
when we extended the million term loan in june  we entered into new interest rate swap agreements with four counterparties to effectively fix the rate on the million unsecured term loan at compared to the prior rate of for the full year in the decrease is also attributable to lower net borrowings on our million unsecured facility in the current year due to the receipt of approximately million in net offering proceeds in february interest and other income decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the variance is attributable to a million non recurring settlement in the prior period of an acquisition contingency in our favor for an acquisition which closed in 
index to financial statements equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily a result of recognizing our proportionate share of an impairment loss on one of our unconsolidated joint ventures of approximately million in the prior period 
we expect equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures to fluctuate based on the timing and extent to which dispositions occur as our unconsolidated joint ventures approach their stated dissolution periods 
income from continuing operations per share on a fully diluted basis increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  for a number of reasons  including the impairment loss incurred in the prior year  higher other rental income in the current year due to income recognized for lease terminations and restructurings  as well as lower operating expenses primarily related to lower estimated property tax assessments at several of our buildings  and lower interest expense as compared to prior year 
discontinued operations in accordance with gaap  we have classified the operations of the sylvan avenue building in englewood cliffs  new jersey  which sold in  as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
loss income from discontinued operations was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
loss from discontinued operations during the current year is the result of recognizing an impairment charge of approximately million in conjunction with adjusting the assets to estimated fair value the sales price  less estimated costs to sell  as well as a subsequent loss on the sale of the building of approximately million  which was the result of costs incurred for the substitution of another property for the sylvan avenue building in our secured pooled facility 
we do not expect that income from discontinued operations will be comparable to future periods  as such income is subject to the timing and existence of future property dispositions 
comparison of the year ended december  vs 
the year ended december  our income from continuing operations decreased from to primarily due to the recognition of an impairment loss of approximately million related to the auburn hills corporate center building in auburn hills  michigan  the west long lake road building in troy  michigan  and the durham avenue building in south plainfield  new jersey 
the decrease in income from continuing operations is also due to the recognition of approximately million in in other rental income related to significant lease terminations in at our glenridge highlands two building  our connection drive building in irving  texas  our brookside parkway building in alpharetta  georgia  and our central street building in boxborough  massachusetts 

index to financial statements the following table sets forth selected data from our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and  respectively  as well as each balance as a percentage of total revenues for the years presented dollars in millions december  december  increase decrease revenue rental income tenant reimbursements property management fee revenue other rental income total revenues expense property operating costs depreciation amortization impairment loss on real estate assets general and administrative expense real estate operating income other income expense interest expense interest and other income equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures income from continuing operations continuing operations revenue rental income and tenant reimbursements decreased from approximately million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  to approximately million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  the decrease in rental income relates primarily to a reduction in rent associated with the early termination of the cingular lease at our glenridge highlands two building during the fourth quarter a significant portion of the vacated space at the glenridge highlands two building has subsequently been re leased to a new tenant 
the decrease in tenant reimbursement revenue is attributable to adjustments to both current and prior year operating expense recoveries of reimbursable amounts of approximately million 
we also had approximately million less of tenant reimbursements at our glenridge highlands two building primarily because of the termination of the lease discussed above  and the fact that the new tenant at this location has a gross rental structure with a base year for operating expenses in  which precludes the reimbursement of operating expenses 
these decreases in reimbursement revenue were partially offset by an increase in property tax recoveries and reimbursable tenant requested services at certain of our properties of approximately million 
other rental income decreased approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  unlike the majority of our rental income  which is recognized ratably over long term contracts  other rental income consists primarily of lease termination fee income in both years and is recognized once we have completed our obligation to provide space to the tenant  regardless of the date we actually receive the payment of the fee 
other rental income for relates primarily to leases terminated at the glenridge highlands two building  at the central street building  at the brookside parkway building  and at the connection drive building 
other rental income for relates primarily to leases terminated at the aon center building and the auburn hills corporate center building 

index to financial statements expense property operating costs increased approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase is the result of increases in tenant expenses at certain of our properties  a majority of which relates to property taxes of approximately million  billback expenses ie tenant requested services of approximately million  and repair and maintenance costs of approximately million which are noted above as being reimbursed by tenants pursuant to their respective leases 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in utility costs of approximately million 
depreciation expense increased approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  building improvements at the aon center building as well as tenant related expenditures at other properties contributed approximately million of the increase  and accelerated depreciation charges related to lease termination by tenants at the chandler forum building in chandler  arizona partial lease termination and the main street building in irvine  california contributed approximately million of the increase 
additionally  the year ended december  includes twelve full months of depreciation related to the acquisition of the piedmont pointe ii building in bethesda  maryland acquired in june  as compared to approximately six months of depreciation related to the same building during  resulting in additional depreciation expense in the current year of approximately million 
amortization expense decreased approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to intangible lease assets which have become fully amortized subsequent to december   principally at the glenridge highlands two building  the corporate boulevard and the corporate boulevard buildings f k a lockheed martin i ii buildings in rockville  md  and the clarendon building in arlington  va 
the decrease in amortization expense was partially offset by higher charges to amortization in order to adjust intangible lease assets and deferred lease costs associated with lease terminations and restructurings to their net realizable value in the year ended december  the largest of these charges related to a lease termination at the fairway center ii building in brea  ca of approximately million 
during  we recognized an impairment loss of approximately million as a result of lowering expected future rental income and reducing the intended holding periods for the auburn hills corporate center building  and the west long lake road building  as well as the durham avenue building 
the decision to reduce future rental revenues and the holding periods for the two detroit assets was prompted by the loss of prospective replacement tenants and overall declines in the detroit  michigan market 
further  changes in management s expectation of re leasing prospects of the new jersey asset  coupled with general market declines in the south plainfield submarket in which it is located  prompted the reduction of intended hold period and future rental revenues during the cumulative effect of these decisions triggered a reassessment of leasing assumptions for these buildings  which entailed  among other things  evaluating market rents  leasing costs and the downtime necessary to complete the necessary releasing activities see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statement for further details 
general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  of this decrease  approximately million is related to net savings realized through the termination of a service agreement with our former advisor in july as well as a reduction in services related to another service agreement with our former advisor in additionally  offering costs of approximately million which had been capitalized in in anticipation of a public stock offering  were later expensed in when such offering was indefinitely delayed 
finally  we recognized approximately million of recoveries in of previously recorded bad debt reserves which were deemed to be recoverable 
in contrast  we incurred approximately million of bad debt charges in other income expense interest expense  which includes interest incurred under our interest rate swap  increased approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  although in 
index to financial statements general  interest rates and borrowings were lower compared to  we incurred a full year of interest expense related to our million unsecured term loan during  as opposed to approximately six months of expense in the prior year 
interest and other income increased approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the following non recurring items the settlement of an acquisition contingency in our favor at a certain acquisition which closed in of approximately million  and loan extension fee income of approximately million related to our investments in mezzanine debt in equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased approximately million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of recognizing our proportionate share of an impairment loss on the joint venture which owns the kato road building in fremont  california of approximately million in as compared with recognizing our proportionate share of an impairment loss on the joint venture which owns the building in leawood  kansas in of approximately million 
the decrease in the income was also partially offset as a result of lease intangible assets which have fully amortized at the aiu building in hoffman estate  illinois 
income from continuing operations per share on a fully diluted basis decreased from per share for the year ended december  to per share for the year ended december  primarily as a result of the impairment loss incurred in as well as significant other rental income related to lease terminations in prior periods which were recognized in we also incurred higher depreciation expense mostly due to a full year s depreciation at our piedmont pointe ii building  as well as building improvements and other tenant related expenditures at various properties in discontinued operations in accordance with gaap  we have classified the operations of properties held for sale and sold as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
income from discontinued operations was approximately million and approximately million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these amounts consist of operations of the sylvan avenue building in englewood cliffs  new jersey sold in december  as well as the citigroup fort mill building in fort mill  south carolina and the videojet technology building in wood dale  illinois  which were both sold in march  but had annual operating expense adjustments recognized in the first quarter funds from operations  core funds from operations  and adjusted funds from operations affo net income calculated in accordance with gaap is the starting point for calculating ffo  core ffo  and affo 
ffo  core ffo  and affo are non gaap financial measures and should not be viewed as an alternative measurement of our operating performance to net income 
management believes that accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result  we believe that the use of ffo  core ffo  and affo  together with the required gaap presentation  provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating  financing  and investing activities 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition as follows net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets including our proportionate share of depreciation and amortization related to investments in 
index to financial statements unconsolidated joint ventures 
other reits may not define ffo in accordance with the nareit definition  or may interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do  therefore  our computation of ffo may not be comparable to such other reits 
we calculate core ffo as ffo calculated as set forth above less impairment charges and significant  non recurring items including our proportionate share of any impairment charges or extraordinary items recognized during the period related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
we calculate affo as core ffo calculated as set forth above exclusive of the net effects of i amortization associated with deferred financing costs  ii depreciation on non income producing real estate assets  iii straight line lease revenue expense  iv amortization of above and below market lease intangibles  v stock based and other non cash compensation expense  vi amortization of mezzanine discount income  and vii non incremental capital expenditures as defined below 
our proportionate share of such adjustments related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are also included when calculating affo 
reconciliations of net income to ffo  core ffo  and affo are presented below in thousands except per share amounts per share per share per share net income attributable to piedmont depreciation of real assets wholly owned properties and unconsolidated partnerships amortization of lease related costs wholly owned properties and unconsolidated partnerships loss on sale wholly owned properties gain on sale unconsolidated partnerships funds from operations adjustments loss on impairment of real estate assets wholly owned properties and unconsolidated partnerships core funds from operations adjustments non incremental capital expenditures deferred financing cost amortization depreciation of non real estate assets straight line effects of lease revenue expense amortization of lease related intangibles above below market in place lease intangibles stock based and other non cash compensation amortization of fair market adjustments on notes payable income from amortization of discount on purchases of mezzanine loans adjusted funds from operations weighted average shares outstanding diluted based on weighted average shares outstanding diluted 

index to financial statements represents capital expenditures of a recurring nature related to tenant improvements and leasing commissions that do not incrementally enhance the underlying assets income generating capacity 
includes adjustments for wholly owned properties  as well as such adjustments for our proportionate ownership in unconsolidated joint ventures 
election as a reit we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code and have operated as such beginning with our taxable year ended december  to qualify as a reit  we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement to distribute at least of our adjusted reit taxable income  computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains attributable to our stockholders  as defined by the code 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we may be subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income for that year and for the four years following the year during which qualification is lost and or penalties  unless the irs grants us relief under certain statutory provisions 
such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
however  we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a reit and intend to continue to operate in the foreseeable future in such a manner that we will remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
we have elected to treat piedmont office holdings  inc poh  a wholly owned subsidiary of piedmont  as a taxable reit subsidiary 
we perform non customary services for tenants of buildings that we own  including real estate and non real estate related services  however  any earnings related to such services performed by our taxable reit subsidiary are subject to federal and state income taxes 
in addition  for us to continue to qualify as a reit  our investments in taxable reit subsidiaries cannot exceed of the value of our total assets 
inflation we are exposed to inflation risk  as income from long term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations 
there are provisions in the majority of our tenant leases that are intended to protect us from  and mitigate the risk of  the impact of inflation 
these provisions include rent steps  reimbursement billings for operating expense pass through charges  real estate tax  and insurance reimbursements on a per square foot basis  or in some cases  annual reimbursement of operating expenses above certain per square foot allowance 
however  due to the long term nature of the leases  the leases may not readjust their reimbursement rates frequently enough to fully cover inflation 
application of critical accounting policies our accounting policies have been established to conform with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied  thus  resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements 
additionally  other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
the critical accounting policies outlined below have been discussed with members of the audit committee of the board of directors 

index to financial statements investment in real estate assets we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our depreciable assets 
we consider the period of future benefit of the asset to determine the appropriate useful lives 
these assessments have a direct impact on net income 
the estimated useful lives of our assets by class are as follows buildings years building improvements years land improvements years tenant improvements shorter of economic life or lease term furniture  fixtures  and equipment years intangible lease assets lease term allocation of purchase price of acquired assets upon the acquisition of real properties  we allocate the purchase price of properties to acquired tangible assets  consisting of land and building  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases and the value of in place leases  based in each case on their estimated fair values 
the fair values of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land and building are determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land and building based on management s determination of the fair value of these assets 
we determine the as if vacant fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors considered by us in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases  including leasing commissions and other related costs 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance  and other operating expenses during the expected lease up periods based on current market conditions 
the fair values of above market and below market in place leases are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining terms of the leases 
the capitalized above market and below market lease values are recorded as intangible lease assets or liabilities and amortized as an adjustment to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the fair values of in place leases include direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant  opportunity costs associated with lost rentals that are avoided by acquiring an in place lease  and tenant relationships 
direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant include commissions  tenant improvements  and other direct costs and are estimated based on our consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease 
these direct costs are included in deferred lease costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the value of opportunity costs is calculated using the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases over a market absorption period for a similar lease 
customer relationships are valued based on expected renewal of a lease or the likelihood of obtaining a particular tenant for other locations 
these lease intangibles are included in intangible lease assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
estimating the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets requires us to estimate market lease rates  property operating expenses  carrying costs during lease up periods  discount rates  market absorption periods  and the number of years the property is held for investment 
the use of inappropriate estimates would result in an incorrect assessment of our purchase price allocations  which would impact the amount of our reported net income 

index to financial statements valuation of real estate assets and investments in joint ventures which hold real estate assets we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of the real estate and related intangible assets  both operating properties and properties under construction  in which we have an ownership interest  either directly or through investments in joint ventures  may not be recoverable 
when indicators of potential impairment are present for wholly owned properties  which indicate that the carrying amounts of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable  we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered from the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
in the event that such expected undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  we adjust the real estate and related intangible assets to the fair value and recognize an impairment loss 
for our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  we assess the fair value of our investment  as compared to our carrying amount 
if we determine that the carrying value is greater than the fair value at any measurement date  we must also determine if such a difference is temporary in nature 
value fluctuations which are other than temporary in nature are then recorded to adjust the carrying value to the fair value amount 
projections of expected future cash flows require that we estimate future market rental income amounts subsequent to the expiration of current lease agreements  property operating expenses  the number of months it takes to re lease the property  and the number of years the property is held for investment  among other factors 
the subjectivity of assumptions used in the future cash flow analysis  including discount rates  could result in an incorrect assessment of the property s fair value and  therefore  could result in the misstatement of the carrying value of our real estate and related intangible assets and our net income attributable to piedmont 
during the year ended december   we recognized an impairment charge on our auburn hills corporate center building approximately million  our durham avenue building approximately million  and our west long lake road building approximately million 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million upon execution of a binding agreement to dispose of the sylvan avenue building  as a component of discontinued operations 
see note and note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on these impairment charges 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts specifically assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in purchase accounting for business combinations  as well as costs incurred as part of the acquisition 
we test the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
such interim circumstances may include  but are not limited to  significant adverse changes in legal factors or in the general business climate  adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  the loss of key personnel  or persistent declines in an entity s stock price below carrying value of the entity 
the test prescribed by authoritative accounting guidance is a two step test 
the first step involves comparing the estimated fair value of the entity to its carrying value  including goodwill 
fair value is determined by adjusting the trading price of the stock for various factors including  but not limited to i liquidity or transferability considerations  ii control premiums  and or iii fully distributed premiums  if necessary  multiplied by the common shares outstanding 
if such calculated fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further procedures or analysis is permitted or required 
however  if the carrying value exceeds the calculated fair value  goodwill is potentially impaired and step two of the analysis would be required 
step two of the test involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the entity from the entity s fair value calculated in step one of the test 
if the implied value of the goodwill the remainder left after deducting the fair values of the entity from its calculated overall fair value in step one of the test is less than the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized 
we have determined through the testing noted above that there are no issues of impairment related to our goodwill as of december  
index to financial statements investment in variable interest entities variable interest entities vies are defined by gaap as entities in which equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
if an entity is determined to be a vie  it must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the enterprise that has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance  absorbs the majority of the entity s expected losses  or receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns 
generally  expected losses and expected residual returns are the anticipated negative and positive variability  respectively  in the fair value of the vie s net assets 
when we make an investment  we assess whether the investment represents a variable interest in a vie and  if so  whether we are the primary beneficiary of the vie 
incorrect assumptions or assessments may result in an inaccurate determination of the primary beneficiary 
the result could be the consolidation of an entity acquired or formed in the future that would otherwise not have been consolidated or the non consolidation of such an entity that would otherwise have been consolidated 
we evaluate each investment to determine whether it represents variable interests in a vie 
further  we evaluate the sufficiency of the entities equity investment at risk to absorb expected losses  and whether as a group  the equity has the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
interest rate swap when we enter into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge our exposure to changing interest rates on our variable rate debt instruments  as required by gaap  we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
we reassess the effectiveness of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedges on a regular basis to determine if they continue to be highly effective and also to determine if the forecasted transactions remain highly probable 
the changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income oci  and the amounts in oci will be reclassified to earnings when the hedged transactions occur 
changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as gain loss on interest rate swap in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is recorded as prepaid expenses and other assets or as interest rate swap liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
amounts received or paid under interest rate swap agreements are recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations as incurred 
currently  we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and do not have any derivatives that are not designated as cash flow hedges 
the valuation of cash flow hedges is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis based on the contractual terms of the derivatives  including the period to maturity of each instrument  and uses observable market based inputs  including interest rate curves and implied volatilities 
therefore  the fair values determined are considered to be based on significant other observable inputs level 
in addition  we consider both our own and the respective counterparties risk of nonperformance in determining the fair value of our derivative financial instruments by estimating the current and potential future exposure under the derivative financial instruments that both we and the counterparties are at risk for as of the valuation date 
this total expected exposure is then discounted using discount factors that contemplate our creditworthiness and the counterparties to arrive at a credit charge 
this credit charge is then netted against the value of the derivative financial instruments determined using the discounted cash flow analysis described above to arrive at a total estimated fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
related party transactions and agreements there were no related party transactions during the three years ended december  
index to financial statements off balance sheet arrangements we are not dependent on off balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity 
our off balance sheet arrangements are discussed in note unconsolidated joint ventures and note commitments and contingencies specifically related to operating lease obligations to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the unconsolidated joint ventures in which we invest are prohibited by their governing documents from incurring debt 
for further information regarding our commitments under operating lease obligations  see the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  as well as the contractual obligations table below 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating lease obligations total amounts include principal payments only 
we made interest payments of million during the year ended december  and expect to pay interest in future periods on outstanding debt obligations based on the rates and terms disclosed herein and in note of our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
additionally  we recorded interest rate swap cash settlements of approximately million during the year ended december  related to our million unsecured term loan as interest expense 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our future income  cash flows  and fair values of our financial instruments depend in part upon prevailing market interest rates 
market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency  exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with any borrowings under our million unsecured facility and our million unsecured term loan 
as a result  the primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk 
many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations  and other factors that are beyond our control contribute to interest rate risk 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow primarily through a low to moderate level of overall borrowings  as well as managing the variability in rate fluctuations on our outstanding debt 
as such  a significant portion of our debt is based on fixed interest rates to hedge against instability in the credit markets  and we have effectively fixed the interest rate on our million unsecured term loan through an interest rate swap agreement 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
our financial instruments consist of both fixed and variable rate debt 
as of december   our consolidated debt consisted of the following in thousands thereafter total maturing debt variable rate repayments variable rate average interest rate fixed rate repayments fixed rate average interest rate the million unsecured term loan has a stated variable rate  however  piedmont entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively fixes the rate on this loan to through june  
index to financial statements see note of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details on our debt structure 
as of december   our consolidated debt consisted of the following in thousands thereafter total maturing debt variable rate repayments variable rate average interest rate fixed rate repayments fixed rate average interest rate amount maturing represents the outstanding balance as of december  on the million unsecured facility 
rate is equal to the weighted average interest rate on all outstanding draws as of december  we may select from multiple interest rate options with each draw  including the prime rate and various length libor locks 
all selections are subject to an additional spread over the selected rate based on our current credit rating as of december  
we extended the term of the million unsecured term loan to june  upon payment of a basis point fee 
the million unsecured term loan has a stated variable rate  however  piedmont entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively fixed the rate on this loan to through june  as of december  and  the estimated fair value of the line of credit and notes payable above were approximately billion 
additionally  the notional amount of our interest rate swap is million  and it carries a fixed interest rate of as of december  the variable rate debt is based on libor plus a specified margin or prime as elected by us at certain intervals 
an increase in the variable interest rate on the variable rate facilities constitutes a market risk  as a change in rates would increase or decrease interest incurred and therefore cash flows available for distribution to stockholders 
the current stated interest rate spread on the million unsecured facility is libor plus 
a change in the interest rate on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio  or on the million unsecured term loan which is effectively fixed through an interest rate swap  impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
as of december   a change in interest rates would have no effect on our interest expense as all of our debt is effectively fixed
