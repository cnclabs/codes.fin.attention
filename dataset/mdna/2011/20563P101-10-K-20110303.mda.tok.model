security products furniture components marine components mauldin  sc grayslake  il kitchener  ontario byron center  mi taipei  taiwan neenah  wi grayslake  il raw materials our primary raw materials are coiled steel used in the furniture components segment for the manufacture of precision ball bearing slides and ergonomic computer support systems  zinc and brass used in the security products segment for the manufacture of locking mechanisms  stainless steel used in the marine components segment for the manufacture of exhaust headers and pipes and other components  and plastic resins used primarily in the furniture components segment for injection molded plastics employed in the manufacturing of ergonomic computer support systems 
these raw materials are purchased from several suppliers  are readily available from numerous sources and accounted for approximately of our total cost of sales for we occasionally enter into supply arrangements for our commodity related raw materials to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material prices that are affected by commodity markets 
while these arrangements do not necessarily commit us to a minimum volume of purchases  they generally provide for stated unit prices based upon achievement of specified purchase volumes  which helps us stabilize our commodity related raw material costs 
commodity related raw materials purchased outside of these arrangements are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
we generally seek to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in these raw material costs on our margins through improvements in production efficiencies or other operating cost reductions 
in the event we are unable to offset raw m aterial cost increases with other cost reductions  it may be difficult to recover those cost increases through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges due to the competitive nature of the markets served by our products 
consequently  overall operating margins can be affected by commodity related raw material cost pressures 
commodity market prices are cyclical  reflecting overall economic trends  specific developments in consuming industries and speculative investor activities 
patents and trademarks we hold a number of patents relating to our component products  certain of which are believed to be important to us and our continuing business activity 
patents generally have a term of years  and our patents have remaining terms ranging from less than one year to years at december  our major trademarks and brand names include furniture components security products marine components compx precision slides compx security products custom marine compx waterloo national cabinet lock livorsi marine compx ergonomx fort lock cmi industrial mufflers compx durislide timberline custom marine stainless dynaslide chicago lock exhaust waterloo furniture stock locks the choice in components limited keset performance boating tubar mega rim ace ii race rim compx elock compx marine lockview software sales  marketing and distribution 
a majority of our component sales are direct to large oem customers through our factory based sales and marketing professionals supported by engineers working in concert with field salespeople and independent manufacturers representatives 
we select manufacturers representatives based on special skills in certain markets or relationships with current or potential customers 
a significant portion of our security products sales are made through distributors 
we have a significant north american market share of cabinet lock security product sales as a result of the locksmith distribution channel 
we support our locksmith distributor sales with a line of standardized products used by the largest segments of the marketplace 
these products are packaged and merchandised for easy availability and handling by distributors and end users 
a significant portion of our furniture component ergonomic product sales are made through value added resellers and distributors 
value added resellers generally provide services to end customers in addition to those of a distributor  such as installation services or packaging our products with other products 
we support our ergonomic value added resellers by providing them with products that may be customized or packaged to meet their needs 
we support our ergonomic distributor sales with a line of standardized products used by the largest segments of the marketplace 
these products are packaged and merchandised for easy availability and handling by distributors and end users 
in  our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our total sales  however  no one customer accounted for more than of our sales 
of the of total sales  related to two security products customers  related to five furniture components customers and related to three customers in both of our security products and furniture components segments 
overall  our customer base is diverse and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
competition the markets in which we participate are highly competitive 
we compete primarily on the basis of product design  including ergonomic and aesthetic factors  product quality and durability  price  on time delivery  service and technical support 
we focus our efforts on the middle and high end segments of the market  where product design  quality  durability and service are valued by the customer 
our security products and furniture components segments compete against a number of domestic and foreign manufacturers 
our marine components segment competes with small domestic manufacturers and is minimally affected by foreign competitors 
international operations we have substantial operations and assets located outside the united states  principally furniture component operations in canada and taiwan 
the majority of our non us sales are to customers located in canada 
these operations are subject to  among other things  currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our results of operations have in the past been both favorably and unfavorably affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
political and economic uncertainties in certain of the countries in which we operate may expose us to risk of loss 
we do not believe that there is currently any likelihood of material loss through political or economic instability  seizure  nationalization or a similar event 
we cannot predict  however  whether events of this type in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the consolidated financial statements 
regulatory and environmental matters our operations are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the use  storage  handling  generation  transportation  treatment  emission  discharge  disposal  remediation of and exposure to hazardous and non hazardous substances  materials and wastes environmental laws 
our operations also are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all such laws and regulations 
to date  the costs of maintaining compliance with such laws and regulations have not significantly impacted our results 
we currently do not anticipate any significant costs or expenses relating to such matters  however  it is possible future laws and regulations may require us to incur significant additional expenditures 
employees as of december   we employed the following number of people united states canada taiwan total approximately of our canadian employees are represented by a labor union covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in january  which provides for wage increases from to over the term of the contract

item a 
risk factors listed below are certain risk factors associated with us and our businesses 
in addition to the potential effect of these risk factors discussed below  any risk factor which could result in reduced earnings or operating losses  or reduced liquidity  could in turn adversely affect our ability to service our liabilities or pay dividends on our common stock or adversely affect the quoted market prices for our securities 
many of the markets in which we operate are mature and highly competitive resulting in pricing pressure and the need to continuously reduce costs 
many of the markets we serve are highly competitive  with a number of competitors offering similar products 
we focus our efforts on the middle and high end segment of the market where we feel that we can compete due to the importance of product design  quality and durability to the customer 
however  our ability to effectively compete is impacted by a number of factors 
the occurrence of any of these factors could result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
competitors may be able to drive down prices for our products beyond our ability to adjust costs because their costs are lower than ours  especially products sourced from asia 
competitors financial  technological and other resources may be greater than our resources  which may enable them to more effectively withstand changes in market conditions 
competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
consolidation of our competitors or customers in any of the markets in which we compete may result in reduced demand for our products 
new competitors could emerge by modifying their existing production facilities to manufacture products that compete with our products 
we may not be able to sustain a cost structure that enables us to be competitive 
customers may no longer value our product design  quality or durability over the lower cost products of our competitors 
sales for certain precision slides and ergonomic products are concentrated in the office furniture market  which has periodically experienced significant reductions in demand that could result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
sales of our products to the office furniture market accounted for approximately in each of and and in of our total net sales 
the future growth  if any  of the office furniture market will be affected by a variety of macroeconomic factors  such as service industry employment levels  corporate cash flows and non residential commercial construction  as well as industry factors such as corporate reengineering and restructuring  technology demands  ergonomic  health and safety concerns and corporate relocations 
there can be no assurance that current or future economic or industry trends will not have a material adverse affect our business 
our failure to enter into new markets would result in the continued significant impact of fluctuations in office furniture market demand on our operating results 
in an effort to reduce our dependence on the office furniture market for certain products and to increase our participation in other markets  we have been devoting resources to identify new customers and develop new applications for our products in markets outside of the office furniture market  such as home appliances  toolboxes and server racks 
developing these new applications for our products involves substantial risk and uncertainties due to our limited experience with customers and applications in these markets as well as facing competitors who are already established in these markets 
we may not be successful in developing new customers or applications for our products outside of the office furniture industry 
significant time may be required to develop new applications and uncertainty exists a s to the extent to which we will face competition in this regard 
our development of innovative features for current products is critical to sustaining and growing our sales 
historically  our ability to provide value added custom engineered products that address requirements of technology and space utilization has been a key element of our success 
we spend a significant amount of time and effort to refine  improve and adapt our existing products for new customers and applications 
since expenditures for these types of activities are not considered research and development expense under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the amount of our research and development expenditures  which is not significant  is not indicative of the overall effort involved in the development of new product features 
the introduction of new product features requires the coordination of the design  manufacturing and marketing of the new product features with current and potential customers 
the ability to coordinate these activities with current and potential customers may be affected by factors beyond our control 
while we will continue to emphasize the introduction of innovative new product features that target customer specific opportunities  there can be no assurance that any new product features we introduce will achieve the same degree of success that we have achieved with our existing products 
introduction of new product features typically requires us to increase production volume on a timely basis while maintaining product quality 
manufacturers often encounter difficulties in increasing production volumes  including delays  quality control problems and shortages of qualified personnel or raw materials 
as we attempt to introduce new product features in the future  there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase production volume without encountering these or other problems  which might n egatively impact our financial condition or results of operations 
recent and future acquisitions could subject us to a number of operational risks 
a key component of our strategy is to grow and diversify our business through acquisitions 
our ability to successfully execute this component of our strategy entails a number of risks  including the identification of suitable growth opportunities  an inaccurate assessment of acquired liabilities that were undisclosed or not properly disclosed  the entry into markets in which we may have limited or no experience  the diversion of management s attention from our core businesses  the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses  difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies  synergies and cost savings  and an increase in our indebtedness and a limitation in our ability to access additional capital when needed 
higher costs of our commodity related raw materials may decrease our liquidity 
certain of the raw materials used in our products are commodities that are subject to significant fluctuations in price in response to world wide supply and demand as well as speculative investor activity 
coiled steel is the major raw material used in the manufacture of precision ball bearing slides and ergonomic computer support systems 
plastic resins for injection molded plastics are also an integral material for ergonomic computer support systems 
zinc and brass are the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of security products 
stainless steel tubing is the major raw material used in the manufacture of marine exhaust systems 
these raw materials are purchased from several suppliers and are generally readily available from numerous sources 
we occasionall y enter into raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in commodity raw material costs 
materials purchased outside of these arrangements are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
should our vendors not be able to meet their contractual obligations or should we be otherwise unable to obtain necessary raw materials  we may incur higher costs for raw materials or may be required to reduce production levels  either of which may decrease our liquidity as we may be unable to offset the higher costs with increases in our selling prices or reductions in other operating costs 
failure to protect our intellectual property rights or claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business 
we rely on patent  trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in our technology and designs 
despite these measures  any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or misappropriated 
others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information  and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties 
further  there can be no assurance that any of our pending trademark or patent applications will be approved 
costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our intellectual property rights 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect intell ectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
therefore  in certain jurisdictions  we may be unable to protect our technology and designs adequately against unauthorized third party use  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
third parties may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights 
even if we believe that such claims are without merit  they can be time consuming and costly to defend and distract our management s and technical staff s attention and resources 
claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected technology  enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards  or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our technology 
if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on reasonable pricing terms or at all  or substitute similar technology from another source  our business could be adversely impacted 
global climate change legislation could negatively impact our financial results or limit our ability to operate our businesses 
we operate production facilities in several countries the united states  canada and taiwan  and we believe all of our worldwide production facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws 
in many of the countries in which we operate  legislation has been passed  or proposed legislation is being considered  to limit green house gases through various means  including emissions permits and or energy taxes 
to date the climate change legislation in effect in the various countries in which we operate has not had a material adverse effect on our financial results 
however  if green house gas legislation were to be enacted in one or more countries  it could negatively impact our future results from operations through increased costs of production  particularly as it relates to our energy requirements 
if such increased costs of production were to materialize  we may be unable to pass price increases onto our customers to compensate for increased production costs  which may decrease our liquidity  operating income and results of operations

net sales increased approximately million in as compared to principally due to an increase in order rates from our customers resulting from improved economic conditions in north america 
our furniture components  security products and marine components segments accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the total increase in sales year over year 
furniture components sales was a greater percentage of the total increase because this segment experienced a greater contraction in demand during the economic downturn in  resulting in a greater relative increa se as customer demand began to return 
the marine components segment accounted for a smaller percentage of the total increase due to the smaller sales volume associated with that segment 
net sales decreased approximately million in as compared to principally due to lower order rates from our customers resulting from unfavorable economic conditions in north america 
our furniture components  security products and marine components segments accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the total decrease in sales year over year 
costs of goods sold and gross margin 
cost of goods sold increased from to primarily due to increased sales volumes 
as a percentage of sales  gross margin increased in from the prior year 
the increase in gross margin percentage is primarily due to improved coverage of overhead and fixed manufacturing costs from higher sales volume and the related efficiency gains 
cost of goods sold decreased from to primarily due to decreased sales volumes 
as a percentage of sales  gross margin decreased in from the prior year 
the decrease in gross margin percentage is primarily due to reduced coverage of overhead and fixed manufacturing costs from lower sales volume and the related under utilization of capacity  partially offset by a net million in fixed manufacturing cost reductions implemented in response to lower sales 
operating costs and expenses 
operating costs and expenses consists primarily of sales and administrative related personnel costs  sales commissions and advertising expenses directly related to product sales and administrative costs relating to business unit and corporate management activities  as well as gains and losses on plant  property and equipment and currency transaction gains and losses 
as a percentage of net sales  operating costs and expenses decreased in compared to primarily due to selling  general and administrative costs increasing at a slower rate than sales volumes 
while operating costs and expenses were reduced by million from to in response to lower sales  it increased as a percentage of net sales due to the significant reduction in sales volumes 
goodwill impairment

currency 
our furniture components segment has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states in canada and taiwan 
the majority of sales generated from our non us operations are denominated in the us dollar with the remainder denominated in other currencies  principally the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar 
most materials  labor and other production costs for our non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar values of our non us sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
 in addition to the impact of the translation of sales and expenses over time  our non us operations also generate currency transaction gains and losses which primarily relate to the difference between the currency exchange rates in effect when non local currency sales or operating costs are initially accrued and when such amounts are settled with the non local currency 
overall  fluctuations in currency exchange rates had the following effects on our furniture component segment s net sales and operating income vs in thousands transaction gains losses translation gain loss impact of rate total currency impact change changes vs impact on net sales operating income vs in thousands transaction gains losses translation gain loss impact of rate total currency impact change changes vs impact on net sales operating income the positive impact on sales in as compared to relates to sales denominated in non us dollar currencies translated into higher us dollar sales due to a strengthening of the local currency in relation to the us dollar 
the negative impact on sales in as compared to relates to sales denominated in non us dollar currencies translated into lower us dollar sales due to a weakening of the local currency in relation to the us dollar 
the negative impact on operating income in as compared to the prior year results from the us dollar denominated sales of us operations converted into lower local currency amounts due to the weakening of the us dollar 
this negatively impacted our gross margin as it results in less local currency generated from sales to cover the costs of non us operations which are denominated in local currency 
the net impact on operating income of changes in currency rates from to was not significant 
general our profitability primarily depends on our ability to utilize our production capacity effectively  which is affected by  among other things  the demand for our products and our ability to control our manufacturing costs  primarily comprised of labor costs and materials 
the materials used in our products consist of purchased components and raw materials some of which are subject to fluctuations in the commodity markets such as coiled steel  zinc  copper  plastic resin and stainless steel 
total material costs represented approximately of our cost of sales in  with commodity related raw materials accounting for approximately of our cost of sales 
worldwide raw material costs increased significantly in and then declined in and began increasing in the second half of we occasio nally enter into commodity related raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in commodity related raw material costs 
while these arrangements do not necessarily commit us to a minimum volume of purchases  they generally provide for stated unit prices based upon achievement of specified volume purchase levels 
this allows us to stabilize commodity related raw material purchase prices to a certain extent  provided the specified minimum purchase quantities are met 
we enter into such arrangements for zinc and coiled steel 
we expect commodity related raw material prices to increase in in conjunction with higher demand as a result of the expected improvement in the world wide economy 
materials purchased on the spot market are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
we generally seek to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in raw material costs on our margins through improvements in production eff iciencies or other operating cost reductions 
in the event we are unable to offset raw material cost increases with other cost reductions  it may be difficult to recover those cost increases through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges due to the competitive nature of the markets served by our products 
consequently  overall operating margins may be affected by raw material cost pressures 
other non operating income  net as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements  other non operating income  net primarily includes interest income 
interest income increased approximately  in compared to primarily due to the higher interest earned on the million note receivable purchased in may which carried an average interest rate of during interest income in compared to decreased  due to lower interest rates on lower invested cash balances 
interest expense interest expense was comparable from to as there was minimal change to our outstanding principal balance on our note payable to affiliate as well as minimal fluctuation in the corresponding interest rate 
the average interest rate at december  was compared to at december  and was offset slightly by increased borrowing on our revolving credit facility 
we averaged million outstanding on our revolving credit facility interest rate of at december  during interest expense decreased approximately million in compared to as the result of a lower average interest rate on the outstanding principal amount of the above referenced note payable at december  compared to at december  
we expect interest e xpense to be comparable to provision for income taxes as a member of the group of companies consolidated for us federal income tax purposes with contran  the parent of our consolidated us federal income tax group  we compute our provision for income taxes on a separate company basis  using the tax elections made by contran 
our separate company basis income tax rates vary by jurisdiction country and or state  and relative changes in the geographic mix of our pre tax earnings can result in fluctuations in the effective income tax rate 
generally  the effective tax rate on income derived from our us operations  including the effect of us state income taxes  is lower than the effective tax rate on income derived from our non us operations  in part due to the deferred tax on all of our foreign earnings as they are deemed to be not permanently reinvested and an election for each of the last three years to not claim a credit with respect to foreign income taxes paid but instead to claim a tax deduction  consistent with the elections of contran 
prior to the first quarter of  we had not recognized a deferred tax liability related to incremental income taxes on the pre undistributed earnings of our taiwanese subsidiary  as those earnings were deemed to be permanently reinvested 
we are required to reassess the permanent reinvestment conclusion on an ongoing basis to determine if our intentions have changed 
at the end of march  and based primarily upon changes in our cash management plans  we determined that all of the undistributed earnings of our taiwanese subsidiary can no longer be considered permanently reinvested in taiwan 
accordingly  in the first quarter of we recognized an aggregate million provision for deferred income taxes on the pre undistributed earnings of our taiwanese subsidiary 
conseq uently  all of the undistributed earnings of our non us operations are now considered to be not permanently reinvested 
our effective income tax rate increased from in to in  primarily as a result of the above mentioned million provision for deferred income taxes in related to undistributed earnings of our taiwanese subsidiary 
we currently expect our effective income tax rate for to be lower than our effective rate for excluding the goodwill impairment charge  our effective income tax rate increased from in to in the increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily due to a higher percentage of our results being sourced from canada and as noted above  the taxes on these results are not claimed as a credit on our us tax return 
segment results the key performance indicator for our segments is the level of their operating income see discussion below

security products net sales increased to million in compared to million in the increase in sales is primarily due to an increase in order rates across most of our customers resulting from improved economic conditions in north america 
gross margin and operating income percentages increased in compared to due to the positive impact of i a million increase in variable contribution primarily as a result of higher sales and improved production efficiencies directly resulting from the higher sales  and ii improved leverage of fixed manufacturing costs which increased only  and selling  general and administrative costs which increased only  on higher sales 
security products net sales decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease in sales is primarily due to lower customer order rates from most of our customers resulting from unfavorable economic conditions in north america 
gross margin percentage increased slightly less than in compared to and operating income percentage was comparable at for the same periods 
the comparable gross margin and operating income percentages were achieved despite the significant decrease in sales due to the positive impact of i a million reduction in fixed manufacturing costs implemented in response to lower sales  ii a million improvement in variable contribution margin through a combination of sales price increases implemented at the beginning of in respon se to cost increases experienced in and a more favorable product mix and iii a  reduction in selling  general and administrative costs in response to lower sales which were partially offset by reduced fixed costs coverage from lower sales and the related under utilization of capacity

gross margin percentage increased approximately in compared to operating income increased from a loss of million in to income of million in the increases in the gross margin percentage and operating income are primarily the result of i a million increase in variable contribution primarily as a result of higher sales and improved production efficiencies directly resulting from the higher sales  ii improved leverage of fixed manufacturing costs due to the significant increase in sales and continued control of costs  and iii lower selling  general and administrative costs primarily due to a million decrease in litigation expense which was partially offset by limited cost increases in response to the higher sales and the negative impact of changes in currency exchange rates

furniture components net sales decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower order rates from most of our customers resulting from unfavorable economic conditions in north america 
gross margin percentage decreased approximately in compared to operating income decreased to a loss of million in as compared to income of million in the decreases in the gross margin percentage and operating income are primarily the result of approximately million in reduced fixed manufacturing cost coverage from lower sales and the related under utilization of capacity combined with approximately million of patent litigation expenses recorded in selling  general and administ rative expense partially offset by reduced fixed manufacturing costs of approximately million and reduced selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million in response to lower sales 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
marine components 
marine components net sales increased in as compared to primarily due to an increase in customer order rates resulting from improved economic conditions in north america 
as a result of the improved labor efficiency and coverage of overhead and fixed cost from the higher sales  gross margin percentage increased approximately from to consequently  the operating loss decreased to in as compared to a loss of million in marine components net sales decreased in as compared to primarily due to a dramatic overall downturn in the marine industry 
gross margin decreased to a loss in as compared to the operating loss for the marine components segment includes a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge  our operating loss increased approximately million in as compared to the decrease in gross margin and increase in operating loss are the result of reduced coverage of fixed costs from lower sales volume  partially offset by reduced fixed manufacturing costs of approximately  and reduced selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately  in response to lower sales 
outlook demand for our products increased compared to the prior year as conditions in the overall economy improved during while changes in market demand are not within our control  we are focused on the areas we can impact 
staffing levels are continuously being evaluated in relation to sales order rates that may result in headcount adjustments  to the extent possible  to match staffing levels with demand 
we expect our continuous lean manufacturing and cost improvement initiatives to positively impact our productivity and result in an efficient infrastructure that we are leveraging as sales improve 
additionally  we continue to seek opportunities to gain market share in markets we currently serve  expand into new markets and develop new product features in order to mitigate the impact of changes in dema nd as well as broaden our sales base 
in addition to challenges with overall demand  volatility in the cost of commodity raw materials is ongoing 
the cost of these raw materials began to increase during as compared to the end of and we currently expect these costs to continue to be volatile during we generally seek to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in commodity raw material costs on our margins through improvements in production efficiencies or other operating cost reductions as well as occasionally executing larger quantity tactical spot buys of these raw materials  which may result in higher inventory balances for a period of time 
in the event we are unable to offset commodity raw material cost increases with other cost reductions  it may be difficult to recover those cost increases through increased product sellin g prices or surcharges due to the competitive nature of the markets served by our products 
consequently  overall operating margins may be affected by commodity raw material cost pressures 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have been involved in certain patent infringement litigation  which has in the past resulted in us incurring significant litigation expense 
with regard to the litigation discussed in note where we were the defendant  we have received a favorable court ruling and dismissal of the patent infringement claims and do not expect to incur any significant additional costs relating to this litigation 
with regard to the litigation where we received a favorable judgment for patent infringement against a competitor  we may incur costs during that could be material relating to the competitor appealing the judgment 
the us dollar weakened in in comparison to the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar  which are the primary currencies of our non us operations 
we currently expect the us dollar to continue to weaken during or remain below the rates that were in effect in  which will likely have a negative impact on our results in comparison to when practical  we will seek to mitigate the negative impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our results by entering into currency hedging contracts 
however  such strategies can not fully mitigate the negative impact of changes in currency exchange rates 
liquidity and capital resources summary 
our primary source of liquidity on an on going basis is our cash flow from operating activities  which is generally used to i fund capital expenditures  ii repay short term or long term indebtedness incurred primarily for capital expenditures  business combinations or reducing our outstanding stock and iii provide for the payment of dividends if declared 
from time to time  we will incur indebtedness to fund capital expenditures  business combinations or other investment activities 
in addition  from time to time  we may also sell assets outside the ordinary course of business  the proceeds of which are generally used to repay indebtedness including indebtedness which may have been collateralized by the assets sold or to fund capital expenditures or business combinations 
consolidated cash flows 
operating activities 
trends in cash flows from operating activities  excluding changes in assets and liabilities  for the last three years have generally been similar to the trends in our earnings 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased in compared to  and in compared to due lower capital expenditure requirements in recent years as a result of lower customer demand 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
changes in assets and liabilities result primarily from the timing of production  sales and purchases 
such changes in assets and liabilities generally tend to even out over time 
however  year to year relative changes in assets and liabilities can significantly affect the comparability of cash flows from operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in this million decline in cash provided by operating activities is primarily the net result of improved operating results in of approximately million exclusive of the noncash asset held for sale write downs of  in and  in  and the impact of lower depreciation and amortization expense in of approximately  lower net cash provided by relative changes in our inventories  receivables  payables and non tax related accruals of million in lower cash paid for income taxes in of approximately  due to timing of payments  and lower cash paid for interest in of  due to the deferral of interest on our note payable to affiliate until march cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the cash provided by operating activities in was comparable to despite the significant decrease in operating results excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment 
comparable cash provided by operating activities in as compared to is primarily the net result of lower operating results in of approximately million exclusive of the million goodwill impairment charge in and the  asset held for sale write down in  and the impact of lower depreciation and amortization expense in of approximately million  higher net cash provided by relative changes in our inventories  receivables  payables and non tax related accruals of million in lower cash paid for income taxes in of million due to lower earnings in  lower cash paid for interest in of million due to lower interest rates  and higher adjustments to the provision for inventory reserves in of approximately  due to an increase in obsolete inventory resulting from reduced demand 
relative changes in working capital can have a significant effect on cash flows from operating activities 
as shown below  our average days sales outstanding increased from december  to december  across all of our segments 
in absolute terms  accounts receivable increased by million in as compared to the increase in our average days sales outstanding was the result of accounts receivable returning to a more normal relationship to sales in due to the improvement in the overall economic environment 
for comparative purposes  we have provided numbers below 
december  december  december  days sales outstanding security products days days days furniture components days days days marine components days days days total days days days as shown below  our average number of days in inventory increased from december  to december  with the exception of security products which decreased by days 
in addition  inventory increased by million in as compared to the overall increase in days in inventory was the result of an increase in inventory in response to the increase in customer demand in the variability in days in inventory among our segments primarily relates to the complexity of the production processes and therefore the length of time it takes to produce end products 
for comparative purposes  we have provided numbers below 
december  december  december  days in inventory security products days days days furniture components days days days marine components days days days total days days days investing activities 
net cash used by investing activities totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures have primarily emphasized improving our manufacturing facilities and investing in manufacturing equipment  which utilizes new technologies and increases automation of the manufacturing process to provide for increased productivity and efficiency 
in  we collected payments of million related to the sale of our european thomas regout operations  that was sold in  which required annual payments over a period of four years 
in  we received our final payment totaling approximately  of which  related to principal and the remaining  related to interest that had accrued over the four year period 
capital expenditures for are estimated at approximately million compared to capital expenditures of million in and million in our capital expenditures in and were limited to expenditures required to meet expected customer demand and properly maintain our facilities 
capital spending for is expected to be funded through cash on hand and cash generated from operations and relates to expenditures required to meet expected customer demand and properly maintain our facilities 
in february  we entered into an unsecured demand promissory note with nl whereby we agreed to loan nl up to million 
our loans to nl will bear interest at the prime rate less  with all principal due on demand on or after march  and in any event no later than december   with interest payable quarterly 
the amount of our outstanding loans to nl at any time is at our discretion 
no amounts were outstanding as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in may of  we purchased from nl and one of its subsidiaries  for million in cash  all of their right  title  and interest in i a subordinated secured mortgage note receivable dated october  and in the original principal amount of million executed by sayreville seaport associates  lp  a delaware limited partnership  and originally payable to nl and its subsidiary  and ii certain other documents related to the note receivable 
we purchased the promissory note for our investment purposes 
the promissory note bears interest at libor plus  payable monthly 
all principal is due no later than october the promissory note is collateralized by a real estate developer s ground lease on certain real property  formerly owned by nl and its subsidiary and ta ken from them in condemnation proceedings  and all improvements to the property performed by the developer 
both the promissory note and our lien on the property are subordinated to certain senior indebtedness of the developer 
in the event the developer has not repaid the promissory note at its stated maturity  we have the right to demand repayment of up to million due under the promissory note from one of the developer s equity partners  and such right is not subordinated to the developer s senior indebtedness 
in addition  nl has provided a guarantee for any amounts due but unpaid under the promissory note 
in order to complete the purchase of the promissory note  we entered into an amendment to our revolving million credit agreement on may  the amendment enabled us to borrow million under the credit agreement  which we utilized along with million of existing cash to complete the purchase 
the pur chase was also approved by the independent members of our board of directors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
financing activities 
net cash used by financing activities totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
cash dividends paid totaled million 
per share in each of   and in  we prepaid approximately million toward our promissory note payable to timet finance management company tfmc 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in  we also repurchased approximately  shares of our class a common stock in market transactions for an aggregate of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   there was million outstanding under our million revolving credit facility that matures in january in may of  we borrowed million under the credit facility to partially fund the purchase of the promissory note receivable discussed above and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
although our bank credit facility has a remaining capacity of million  only million is available to borrow as of the end of december due to limitations imposed by debt covenant restrictions 
as of the first quarter of  we expect the full unused capacity of the facility to become available to us  as such debt covenant limitations are expected to become inapplicable 
in addition  in february we repaid all of the million which was outstanding at december  on the revolving credit facility 
provisions contained in our revolving credit facility could result in the acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness prior to its stated maturity for reasons other than defaults from failing to comply with typical financial covenants 
for example  our revolving credit facility allows the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control as defined of the borrower 
the terms of our revolving credit facility could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside of the ordinary course of business 
although there are no current expectations to borrow on the revolving credit facility  lower future operating results would likely reduce or eliminate our amount available to borrow and restrict future dividends 
se e also note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other than certain operating leases discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries or affiliates are parties to any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other we believe cash generated from operations together with cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and dividends if declared for the next twelve months and our long term obligations for the next five years 
to the extent that actual operating results or other developments differ from our expectations  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
we periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and available resources in view of  among other things  our capital expenditure requirements  dividend policy and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  we have in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital  refinance or restructure indebtedness  issue additional securities  repurchase shares of our common stock  modify our dividend policy or take a combination of such steps to manage our liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  we may review opportunities for acquisitions  joint ventures or other business combinations in the component products industry 
in the event of any such transaction  we may consider using available cash  issu ing additional equity securities or increasing our indebtedness or that of our subsidiaries 
contractual obligations 
as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we are a party to various debt  lease and other agreements that contractually and unconditionally commit us to pay certain amounts in the future 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes such contractual commitments as of december  by the type and date of payment 
payments due by period total and after in thousands note and interest payable to affiliate long term debt  including interest operating leases purchase obligations income taxes fixed asset acquisitions total contractual cash obligations the timing and amount shown for our commitments related to indebtedness  operating leases and fixed asset acquisitions are based upon the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for those commitments 
the amounts shown for interest on indebtedness are based upon the december  interest rates on outstanding indebtedness  and assumes such interest rates remain unchanged through the maturity date of the indebtedness 
the timing and amount shown for purchase obligations  which consist of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations primarily commitments to purchase raw materials is also based on the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for those commitments 
the amount shown for income taxes is the consolidated amount of income taxes payable at de cember   which is assumed to be paid during fixed asset acquisitions include firm purchase commitments for capital projects 
commitments and contingencies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements 
there have been no recent accounting pronouncements affecting our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates we have based the accompanying management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations upon our consolidated financial statements 
we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory reserves  the recoverability of long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets and the realization of deferred income tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our actual future results might differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are applicable to all of our operating segments goodwill our goodwill totaled million at december  we perform a goodwill impairment test annually in the third quarter of each year 
goodwill is also evaluated for impairment at other times whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the estimated fair values of our three reporting units are determined using level inputs of a discounted cash flow technique since level inputs of market prices are not available at the reporting unit level 
if the fair value is less than the book value  the asset is written down to the estimated fair value 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital  are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans 
however  different assumptions and estimates could result in materially different findings which could result in the recognition of a material goodwill impairment 
no goodwill impairments were deemed to exist as a result of our annual impairment review completed during the third quarter of  as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of the net carrying value of the respective reporting unit 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets we assess property and equipment for impairment only when circumstances as specified in asc  property  plant  and equipment indicate an impairment may exist 
our determination is based upon  among other things  our estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset level inputs and our estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital  are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans 
due to management s approval of a restructuring plan for our furniture components reporting unit in november of  which includes moving precision slide production from our byron center  michigan facility to other precision slide manufacturing facilities within our furniture components unit  we evaluated the long lived assets for our byron center facility 
as of december   we concluded no impairments were present 
however  if our future cash flows from operations less capital expenditures were to drop significantly below our current expectations  it is reasonably likely we would conclude an impairment was present 
no other long lived assets in our other reporting units were tested for impairment during because there were no circumstances indicating an impairment may exist 
income taxes we recognize deferred taxes for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period the change in estimate was made 
we reevaluate at the end of each reporting period whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not permanently reinvested as that term is defined in gaap 
at the end of march  and based primarily upon changes in our cash management plans  we determined that all of the undistributed earnings of our taiwanese subsidiary can no longer be considered permanently reinvested in taiwan 
accordingly  in the first quarter of we recognized an aggregate million provision for deferred income taxes on the pre undistributed earnings of our taiwanese subsidiary 
consequently  all of the undistributed earnings of our non us operations are now considered to be not permanently reinvested 
while we may have currently concluded that all of the undistributed earn ings are not permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances can change in the future  and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances  such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries  could result in a conclusion that some or all of the undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested 
if our prior conclusions change  we would be required to derecognize a previously recognized deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental us income tax and withholding tax liability related to the amount of undistributed earnings considered to be permanently reinvested 
we record a reserve for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  income taxes  for tax positions where we believe it is more likely than not our position will not prevail with the applicable tax authorities 
our reserve for uncertain tax positions is nil for each of   and accruals we record accruals for environmental  legal and other contingencies and commitments when estimated future expenditures associated with the contingencies become probable  and we can reasonably estimate the amounts of the future expenditures 
however  new information may become available to us  or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount we are required to accrue for such matters and  therefore  a corresponding decrease or increase of our reported net income in the period of such change 
assets held for sale our assets held for sale at december   consist of a facility in river grove  illinois and land in neenah  wisconsin 
these two properties primarily land  buildings and building improvements were formerly used in our operations 
during the third quarter of  and as weak economic conditions continued longer than expected  we obtained an independent appraisal for the river grove facility the most significant of these two properties 
based on this appraisal  we recorded a write down of  during the third quarter of to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value less cost to sell 
this charge is included in corporate operating expense 
during the fourth quarter of  we obtained an independent appraisal for the neenah land 
based on this appraisal  the carrying value of the asset approximates the fair value less cost to sell and therefore no adjustment to the carrying value was deemed necessary 
the combined carrying value of these two properties is million at december  the appraisals represent a level input as defined by asc both properties are being actively marketed 
however  due to the current state of the commercial real estate market  we can not be certain of the timing of the disposition of the assets 
if we continue to experience difficulty in disposing of the assets at or above their carrying value  we may have to record additional write downs of the assets in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and raw materials prices 
interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december  and  all of our outstanding indebtedness was comprised of variable rate instruments 
the following table presents principal amounts  interest rates and fair value for our outstanding indebtedness at december  and see note to our consolidated financial statements 
amount indebtedness carrying value fair value interest rate maturity date in thousands december  variable rate indebtedness promissory note to timet revolving credit facility total december  variable rate indebtedness promissory note to timet all of our debt is at variable interest rates 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates 
as of december  the analysis indicated that such rate movements would not have a material effect on our financial results from operations or cash flows 
however  actual gains or losses in the future may differ materially from our analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movement 
currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling our products outside the united states principally canada and taiwan 
a portion of our sales generated from our non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a substantial portion of our sales generated from our non us operations are denominated in the us dollar 
most materials  labor and other production costs for these non us operations are primarily denominated in local currencies 
as a result  the translated us dollar value of our non us sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
as previously noted certain of our sales generated by our canadian operations are denominated in us dollars 
consequently  we periodically enter into forward currency contracts to mitigate the financial statement impact of changes in currency exchange rates 
at each balance sheet date  outstanding forward currency contracts are marked to market with any resulting gain or loss recognized in income currently unless the contract is designated as a hedge upon which the mark to market adjustment is recorded in other comprehensive income 
we had no forward currency contracts outstanding at december  or december  raw materials 
we will occasionally enter into commodity related raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in commodity related raw material costs 
otherwise  we generally do not have long term supply agreements for our raw material requirements because either we believe the risk of unavailability of those raw materials is low and we believe the price to be stable or because long term supply agreements for those materials are generally not available 
we do not engage in commodity raw material hedging programs 
other 
the above discussion includes forward looking statements of market risk which assumes hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be our projections of future events  gains or losses 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties some of which are listed in business general
