item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share data and unless otherwise indicated executive overview united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world  with an integrated network of rental locations in the united states and canada 
although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse  we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because  as a larger company  we have more extensive resources and certain competitive advantages 
these include a fleet of rental equipment with a total original equipment cost oec of billion  and a national branch network that operates in states and every canadian province  and serves of the largest metropolitan areas in the united states 
in addition  our size gives us greater purchasing power  the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services  the ability to provide customers with equipment that is better maintained and therefore more productive and reliable  and the ability to enhance the earning potential of our assets by transferring equipment among branches to satisfy customer needs 
we offer approximately  classes of equipment for rent to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies  manufacturers  utilities  municipalities  homeowners and government entities 
our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals  sales of used rental equipment  sales of new equipment  contractor supplies sales and service and other 
in  equipment rental revenues represented percent of our total revenues 
as we entered  our operating environment continued to be challenged by the economic events of the prior months the financial crisis and consequent credit restrictions  the widespread recession and a severe downturn in non residential construction activity of unprecedented depth and duration 
late in the first quarter of  we began to see signs of a recovery in some of our end markets  this recovery continued at a modest level through the remainder of the year 
we believe that our performance in the second half of which included a percent year over year increase in the volume of our equipment on rent primarily reflects cyclical improvements in our operating environment 
in addition  we believe that the economic environment which was characterized by tight credit markets and cautious customer behavior helped create a wave of first time renters  and that some of these renters will not return to purchasing equipment when the pace of construction activity accelerates 
in  based on our analysis of leading industry forecasts and broader economic indicators  we expect the recovery in our end markets to continue at a modest pace 
in particular  we estimate that us non residential construction activity  our primary end market  will increase in the mid single digit percent range year over year in for the past several years  our strategy has focused on generating significant free cash flow and positioning our business for disciplined growth of revenues and earnings at higher margins 
the implementation of this strategy calls for a superior standard of customer service  an increasing proportion of revenues derived from larger accounts and a targeted presence in industrial and specialty markets 
four key elements of this strategy are a consistent focus on our core business of equipment rental  the optimization of our rental fleet and branch network  both in terms of composition and management  responsible rate management  and greater efficiency in all areas of operation as evidenced by a significant reduction in costs 
although the economic environment continued to present challenges for both our company and the us equipment rental industry in  we succeeded in realizing a number of achievements related to our strategy 
these achievements include an increase in the proportion of our equipment rental revenues derived from national account customers  from percent in to percent in national accounts are generally defined as 
table of contents customers with potential annual spend of  or more on equipment rentals or customers doing business in multiple locations  full year free cash flow generation of in  after net rental capital expenditures defined as purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment of in  we selectively invested in fleet where warranted by demand  which resulted in a significant increase in net rental capital expenditures from in  continued improvement in fleet management  including a record average of billion oec of fleet transferred among branches per quarter in  to deploy assets in areas of greater earnings potential  continued improvement in customer service management  including an increase in the percentage of equipment rental revenues from accounts that are managed by a single point of contact 
establishing a single point of contact for our key accounts helps us provide more uniform customer service management 
equipment rental revenues from national accounts and other large customers managed by a single point of contact increased to percent of our total equipment rental revenues in from percent in additionally  we expanded our centralized customer care center ccc 
the ccc  which established a second base of operations in  handled percent more rental reservations than in  a further reduction in our employee headcount from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december   the continued optimization of our network of rental locations  including a further reduction in the overall number of branches from at december  to at december   and the opening of five new trench safety  power and hvac rental locations to grow our specialty rental business  and a year over year reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses of  or percent 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses improved by percentage points in in  we will continue to focus on optimizing our core business through diligent management of the rental process  the strengthening of our customer service capabilities  and sustained cost controls 
additionally  we will focus on leveraging technology and training to improve rental rate performance and make the delivery and pick up of our rental equipment to and from customers more efficient  further increasing the proportion of our revenues derived from national accounts and other large customers 
to the extent that we are successful  we believe that over the long term we can improve our equipment rental gross margins and overall profitability  as large accounts tend to rent more equipment for longer periods of time and can be serviced more cost effectively than short term transactional customers  accelerating our pursuit of opportunities in the industrial marketplace  where we believe our depth of resources and branch footprint give us a competitive advantage 
additionally  industrial equipment demand is subject to different cyclical pressures than construction demand  and further capitalizing on the demand for the higher margin power and temperature control equipment rented by our trench safety  power and hvac business 
although there are near term challenges that may continue to constrain equipment rental demand  we believe that our strategy  together with our competitive advantages of size and a strong balance sheet  puts us in a unique position to capitalize on opportunities that may arise during the recovery 

table of contents financial overview despite the challenges posed by recent economic and credit market conditions  we succeeded in taking a number of positive actions in and related to our capital structure  and have significantly improved our financial flexibility and liquidity 
these actions include in june  united rentals north america urna issued aggregate principal amount of percent senior notes  which are due june   and received net proceeds of in november  urna issued aggregate principal amount of percent senior notes the percent notes  which are due december   and received net proceeds of in november  contemporaneous with the issuance of the percent notes  we issued aggregate principal amount of percent convertible senior notes  which are due november   and received net proceeds of in october  urna issued aggregate principal amount of percent senior subordinated notes  which are due september   and received net proceeds of as discussed elsewhere in this report  proceeds from these offerings  as well as cash on hand  were used to repurchase or redeem and subsequently retire certain of our outstanding debt securities 
these actions have improved our debt maturity profile and positioned us to invest the necessary capital in our business to take advantage of opportunities in the economic recovery

as discussed below see goodwill impairment charge  we recognized a non cash goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of related to certain reporting units within our general rentals segment 
the charge reflected the challenges of the construction cycle  as well as the broader economic and credit environment 
substantially all of the impairment charge relates to goodwill arising out of acquisitions made between and as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  this non cash charge primarily relates to the impact of impairing certain rental equipment and leasehold improvement write offs 
this charge  which relates to the june repurchase of our series c and series d preferred stock  reduces income available to common stockholders for earnings per share purposes  but does not affect net income loss 
primarily relates to the establishment of a valuation allowance related to certain foreign tax credits that  as a result of the preferred stock redemption  were no longer expected to be realized 
in addition to the matters discussed above  our performance reflects increased gross profit from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment  and reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses

ebitda represents the sum of net loss  loss from discontinued operation  net of taxes  benefit for income taxes  interest expense  net  interest expense subordinated convertible debentures  net  depreciation of rental equipment and non rental depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda represents ebitda plus the sum of the restructuring charge  the charge related to the settlement of the sec inquiry  the goodwill impairment charge and stock compensation expense  net 
these items are excluded from adjusted ebitda internally when evaluating our operating performance and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time  as well as with those of other similar companies 
management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda  when viewed with the company s results under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and the accompanying reconciliation  provide useful information about operating performance and period over period growth  and 
table of contents provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions 
additionally  management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings  from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced 
however  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and  accordingly  should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity

as discussed below see goodwill impairment charge  we recognized a non cash goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of related to certain reporting units within our general rentals segment 
the charge reflected the challenges of the construction cycle  as well as the broader economic and credit environment 
substantially all of the impairment charge relates to goodwill arising out of acquisitions made between and represents non cash  share based payments associated with the granting of equity instruments 
for the year ended december   ebitda increased  or percent  and adjusted ebitda increased  or percent  primarily reflecting increased margins from sales of rental equipment and selling  general and administrative expense reductions 
for the year ended december   ebitda increased primarily reflecting the absence of the  non cash goodwill impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of related to certain reporting units within our general rentals segment 
excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge  the ebitda decline reflects lower equipment rental gross profit due to the softening construction environment  lower new and used equipment sales and reduced sales of contractor supplies  consistent with our strategy to focus on the higher margin core rental business 
on an adjusted basis  our ebitda declined  or percent  and our ebitda margin decreased by percentage points to percent  also reflecting lower equipment rental gross profit and reduced revenues from our other lines of business 

table of contents revenues 
revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december  were as follows year ended december  percent change equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other revenue total revenues equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment  as well as related revenues such as the fees we charge for equipment delivery  fuel  repair or maintenance of rental equipment and damage waivers 
sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment 
contractor supplies sales include our sales of supplies utilized by contractors  which include construction consumables  tools  small equipment and safety supplies 
services and other revenue includes our repair services including parts sales as well as the operations of our subsidiaries that develop and market software for use by equipment rental companies in managing and operating multiple branch locations 
total revenues of billion decreased percent  compared with total revenues of billion in the decrease primarily reflects a percent decline in sales of rental equipment and a percent decline in contractor supplies sales 
equipment rental revenue increased slightly as a percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and the favorable impact of changes in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars were largely offset by a percent decrease in rental rates and other 
in  based on our analysis of leading industry forecasts and the broader economic environment  we estimate that us non residential construction activity will increase in the mid single digit percent range as compared to we expect to outperform the market in as improved rental rates and increased volume of oec on rent will each contribute to rental revenue growth 
the decline in sales of rental equipment in primarily reflects a decline in the volume of equipment sold 
the decline in contractor supplies sales in reflects a reduction in the volume of supplies sold  partially offset by improved pricing and product mix driven by our continued focus on higher margin products 
total revenues of billion decreased percent  compared with total revenues of billion in the decrease primarily reflects a percent decrease in equipment rental revenue  a percent decline in sales of new equipment  a percent decline in contractor supplies sales  and a percent decline in sales of rental equipment 
the decrease in equipment rental revenue reflects an percent decrease in rental rates and a percent decrease in the volume of oec on rent 
the decline in sales of new equipment reflects volume declines 
the decline in contractor supplies sales reflects a reduction in the volume of supplies sold  consistent with a weak construction environment  partially offset by improved pricing and product mix driven by our continued focus on higher margin products 
the decline in sales of rental equipment primarily reflects lower pricing due to general softness in the used equipment market and an increased proportion of used equipment sold through the auction channel  partially offset by a higher number of units sold 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in applying many accounting principles  we make assumptions  estimates and or judgments 
these assumptions  estimates and or judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis 
material changes in these assumptions  estimates and or judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations 
we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results were we to change underlying assumptions  estimates and or judgments 
although actual results may differ from those estimates  we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize equipment rental revenue on a straight line basis 
our rental contract periods are daily  weekly or monthly 
by way of example  if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily  weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars  and  respectively  we would recognize revenue of per day 
the daily rate for recognition purposes is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of by the monthly term of days 
as part of this straight line methodology  when the equipment is returned  we recognize as incremental revenue the excess  if any  between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date 
in any given accounting period  we will have customers return equipment and be contractually required to pay us more than the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date 
for instance  continuing the above example  if the above customer rented a piece of equipment on december and returned it at the close of business on january  we would recognize incremental revenue on january of in actual dollars  representing the difference between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay and the cumulative amount recognized to date on a straight line basis 
we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
we had deferred revenue of and as of december  and  respectively 
revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to  or pick up by  the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to  or pick up by  the customer 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts 
these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical write off experience 
our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances  including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers 
accordingly  we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance 
trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes 
write offs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds 
useful lives of rental equipment and property and equipment 
we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives  after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to percent of cost 
costs we incur in connection with refurbishment programs that extend the life of our equipment are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related equipment 
the costs incurred under these refurbishment programs were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  and are included in purchases of rental equipment in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenues  such periods are periodically reviewed for reasonableness 
in addition  the salvage value  which is also reviewed periodically for reasonableness  is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period 
we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances 
if these estimates change in the future  we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 
to the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one year  we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately or  respectively 
similarly  to the extent the estimated salvage values of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one percentage point  we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would change by approximately any change in depreciation expense as a result of a hypothetical change in either useful lives or salvage values would generally result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit we would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the asset 
to the extent that the useful lives of all of our depreciable property and equipment were to increase or decrease by one year  we estimate that our annual non rental depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately or  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets excluding goodwill 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets  including rental equipment and property and equipment  when events or changes in circumstances occur 
table of contents that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pre tax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized asset impairment charges of  and  respectively  in our general rentals segment 
the impairment charge is primarily reflected in non rental depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and principally relates to write offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets in connection with the consolidation of our branch network discussed below see restructuring charge 
the impairment charge includes reflected in depreciation of rental equipment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  as well as primarily related to leasehold improvement write offs which are reflected in non rental depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the impairment charge of is reflected in depreciation of rental equipment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and relates to certain rental equipment 
our estimates of the impairment charges for the rental fleet were calculated by comparing the proceeds estimated to be realized from the expected disposition of these rental assets to their carrying values 
the impairments of the rental fleet  as well as the and write offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets  followed from our decision to close an aggregate of branches in and as of december  and  there were and of held for sale assets reflected in rental equipment  net in our consolidated balance sheets  respectively 
in addition to the impairment reviews we conduct in connection with branch consolidations and other changes in the business  each quarter we conduct a review of rental assets with utilization below a specified threshold 
we select these assets  which represented approximately three percent of our total rental assets at december   as we believe they are at the greatest risk of potential impairment 
as part of this impairment review  we estimate future rental revenues based on current and expected utilization levels  the age of these assets and their remaining useful lives 
additionally  we estimate when the asset is expected to be removed or retired from our rental fleet as well as the expected proceeds to be realized upon disposition 
based on our most recently completed december  quarterly review  there was no impairment associated with these assets 
purchase price allocation 
we have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future 
we allocate the cost of the acquired enterprise to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
with the exception of goodwill  long lived fixed assets generally represent the largest component of our acquisitions 
the long lived fixed assets that we acquire are primarily rental equipment  transportation equipment and real estate 
in addition to long lived fixed assets  we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities 
these other assets and liabilities typically include  but are not limited to  parts inventory  accounts receivable  accounts payable and other working capital items 
because of their short term nature  the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values reflected on the acquired entities balance sheets 
however  when appropriate  we adjust these book values for factors such as collectibility and existence 
the intangible assets that we have acquired are primarily goodwill  customer relationships and non compete agreements 
goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
customer relationships and non compete agreements are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach with consideration to projected cash flows 
evaluation of goodwill impairment 
we have made acquisitions over the years  principally during the period between and  which included the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
accounting rules permit a company to carry forward a detailed determination of a reporting unit s fair value from one year to the next if the following 
table of contents criteria are met i the assets and liabilities of each reporting unit have not changed significantly from the prior year  ii the carrying amount of each reporting unit in the prior year significantly exceeded the fair value  and iii the likelihood that the carrying value of each reporting unit this year would be less than the fair value is remote 
in  because these criteria were met  we carried forward the results of our fair value estimates 
in and  we estimated the fair value of our reporting units or our regions using a combination of an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a market approach based on market price data of shares of our company and other corporations engaged in similar businesses 
we believe this approach  which utilizes multiple valuation techniques  yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value 
we review goodwill for impairment utilizing a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units to the respective carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit is less than its fair value  no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step must be performed 
in the second step  the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 
inherent in our development of the present value of future cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  business plans  expected growth rates  cost of capital and tax rates 
we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions  interest rates and other market data 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods 
changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit  and therefore could affect the amount of potential impairment 
the following assumptions are significant to our income approach business projections we make assumptions about the level of equipment rental activity in the marketplace and cost levels 
these assumptions drive our planning assumptions for pricing and utilization and also serve as key inputs for developing our cash flow projections 
these projections are derived using our internal business plans over a ten year planning period that are updated at least annually and reviewed by our board of directors  long term growth rates beyond the planning period  we also determine an assumed long term growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting unit s earnings stream is projected to grow 
these rates are used to calculate the terminal value of our reporting units  and are added to the cash flows projected during our ten year planning period  and discount rates our combined future cash flows are then discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be used by market participants 
the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 
the market approach is one of the other primary methods used for estimating the fair value of a reporting unit 
this assumption relies on the market value market capitalization of companies that are engaged in the same or a similar line of business 
during the fourth quarter of  and in connection with the preparation of our year end financial statements  we recognized an aggregate non cash goodwill impairment charge of billion related to certain reporting units within our general rentals segment 
the charge reflected the challenges of the construction cycle  as well as the broader economic and credit environment  and included billion  reflecting conditions at the time of our annual october  testing date  as well as an additional as of december   reflecting further deterioration in the economic and credit environment during the fourth quarter of substantially all of the impairment charge related to goodwill arising from acquisitions made between and 
table of contents as of october   we had of goodwill on our balance sheet and  of this amount  substantially all related to our trench safety  power and hvac reportable segment and three of our reporting units within the general rentals reportable segment southwest  northwest and east 
our impairment testing indicated that the fair value estimates of the reporting units that were carried forward exceeded the carrying values  thereby resulting in no indication of impairment 
the results of this impairment analysis are summarized in the table below reporting unit goodwill balance at october  carrying value at october  fair value estimate trench safety  power and hvac southwest northwest east the underlying analyses supporting our fair value assessment related to our outlook of the business long term performance  which included key assumptions as to the appropriate discount rate and long term growth rate 
in connection with our impairment testing in the prior year  we utilized a discount rate of nine percent and a long term terminal growth rate of two percent beyond our planning period 
we also performed sensitivity analyses on our assumptions  and noted that increasing the discount rate by one percent still resulted in fair values in excess of the carrying values 
we also stress tested the long term growth rate by reducing it to percent  noting that the fair values for all reporting units were still in excess of the carrying values 
we also stress tested the analysis to increase the discount rate to percent and reduce the long term growth rate to percent as well as in several other combinations for reasonably possible scenarios noting that the carrying values were exceeded by the fair values 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized 
in the case of deferred tax assets  the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and tax planning strategies 
the most significant evidence that we consider in the recognition of deferred tax assets is reversal of temporary differences resulting from book versus tax depreciation of our rental equipment fleet 
we also evaluate projected taxable income over a period generally ranging from one to five years  depending on the relevant tax jurisdiction  to determine the recoverability of all deferred tax assets and  in addition  examine the length of the carryforward to ensure the deferred tax assets are established in an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have provided a partial valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset for state operating loss carryforward amounts 
this valuation allowance was required because it is more likely than not that some of the state carryforward amounts will expire unused due to restrictive carryback carryover rules in various states that would limit realization of tax benefits  and our history of certain state operating loss carryforwards expiring unused 
we have adopted an accounting principle which addresses accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and requires the use of a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return regarding uncertainties in income tax positions 
the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

table of contents we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions 
accordingly  accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters 
our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 
reserves for claims 
we are exposed to various claims relating to our business  including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and self insured retentions  which we sometimes refer to as self insurance 
these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment or personnel 
these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and  accordingly  the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time 
our methodology for developing self insurance reserves is based on management estimates  which incorporate periodic actuarial valuations 
our estimation process considers  among other matters  the cost of known claims over time  cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims 
these estimates may change based on  among other things  changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims 
further  these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts 
accordingly  we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels 
as discussed below see fourth quarter items  during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a charge of related to our provision for self insurance reserves 
the charge in particular reflects recent adverse experience in our portfolio of automobile and general liability claims  as well as worker s compensation claims 
legal contingencies 
we are involved in a variety of claims  lawsuits  investigations and proceedings  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report 
we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information 
we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters  which involves an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination such that we expect an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual  or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount  they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination  judgment or settlement occurs 
results of operations as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  our reportable segments are general rentals and trench safety  power and hvac 
the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction  aerial  industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities 
the general rentals segment s customers include construction and industrial companies  manufacturers  utilities  municipalities and homeowners 
the general rentals segment operates throughout the united states and canada 
the trench safety  power and hvac segment includes the rental of specialty construction products and related services 
the trench safety  power and hvac segment s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects  municipalities and industrial companies 
this segment operates throughout the united states and has two locations in canada 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we aggregate our seven geographic regions the southwest  gulf  northwest  southeast  midwest  east  and the northeast canada as well as the aerial west region into our general rentals reporting segment 
historically  there have been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these regions 
for instance  for the five year period ended december   our midwest region s equipment rentals gross margin varied by more than percent from the equipment rentals gross margin of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period 
although the margin for the midwest region exceeded a percent variance level for this five year period  prior to the significant economic downturn in that negatively impacted all our regions  the midwest region s margin 
table of contents was converging with those achieved at the other general rentals regions  and  given management s focus on cost cutting  improved processes and fleet sharing  we expect further convergence going forward 
although we believe aggregating these regions into our general rentals reporting segment for segment reporting purposes is appropriate  to the extent that the margin variances persist and the equipment rentals gross margins do not converge  we may be required to disaggregate the regions into separate reporting segments 
any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations 
these segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates and allocates resources 
we evaluate segment performance based on segment operating results 
our revenues  operating results  and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers  with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter 
revenues by segment were as follows general rentals trench safety  power and hvac total equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other revenues total revenue equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other revenues total revenue equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other revenues total revenue equipment rentals

our effective income tax rate will change based on discrete events such as audit settlements as well as other factors  including the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in those jurisdictions 
the balance of prepaid expenses and other assets at december  decreased by  or percent  as compared to december   primarily due to a federal tax refund of received in march liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital markets activity 
we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices  which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services  ii the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes  regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate 
in october  urna issued aggregate principal amount of percent senior subordinated notes  which are due september  we received in net proceeds from the issuance of the percent senior subordinated notes  after underwriting discounts and commissions  fees and expenses

aggregate costs of were written off in the year ended december  in connection with the repurchases redemptions  comprised of of write offs of debt issuance costs and the write off of the previously terminated derivative transaction 
the losses are reflected in interest expense  net in our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents total debt at december  decreased by  or percent  as compared to december   primarily due to the use of free cash flow to pay down debt see above for a summary of capital market activity 
current maturities of long term debt at december  primarily reflect of borrowings outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization facility 
our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility 
as of december   we had i of borrowing capacity  net of of letters of credit  available under the abl facility  ii of borrowing capacity available under our accounts receivable securitization facility and iii cash and cash equivalents of cash equivalents at december  consist of direct obligations of financial institutions rated a or better 
we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next months 
as of december   and were outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility  respectively 
the interest rates applicable to the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility at december  were percent and percent  respectively 
during the year ended december   the monthly average amounts outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility were and  respectively  and the weighted average interest rates thereon were percent and percent  respectively 
the maximum month end amounts outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility during the year ended december  were and  respectively 
the amount outstanding at year end under the abl facility exceeded the average amounts outstanding during the year primarily due to additional borrowings used to settle a canadian dollar denominated intercompany loan 
we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our existing operations over the next months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital  ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale  iii payments due under operating leases and iv debt service 
we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash 
in addition  we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate  the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit 
for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases  see certain information concerning contractual obligations 
to access the capital markets  we rely on credit rating agencies to assign ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality 
lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets 
credit ratings also affect the costs of derivative transactions  including interest rate and foreign currency derivative transactions 
as a result  negative changes in our credit ratings could adversely impact our costs of funding 
our credit ratings as of january  were as follows corporate rating outlook moody s b stable s p b stable fitch b stable contemporaneous with the october issuance of urna s percent senior subordinated notes  moody s upgraded the company to a corporate rating of b a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
there is no assurance that any rating will remain in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future 

table of contents the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors  including general economic conditions and growth prospects 
we expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations  proceeds from the sale of rental and non rental equipment and  if required  borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility 
we expect our gross and net rental capital expenditures to increase significantly in relative to loan covenants and compliance 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the abl facility  the accounts receivable securitization facility  the senior notes and the quips 
any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 
the only material financial covenants which currently exist relate to the fixed charge coverage ratio and the senior secured leverage ratio under the abl facility 
both of these covenants were suspended on june  because the availability  as defined in the agreement governing the abl facility  had exceeded percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility 
subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility  these covenants will only apply in the future if availability under the abl facility falls below percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility 
since the june  suspension date and through december   availability under the abl facility has exceeded percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility and  as a result  these maintenance covenants remained inapplicable 
under our accounts receivable securitization facility  we are required  among other things  to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio  ii the delinquency ratio  iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding 
as of december   primarily due to losses sustained in prior years  urna had no restricted payment capacity under the most restrictive restricted payment covenants in the indentures governing its outstanding indebtedness 
although this depletion limits our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings  we do not expect any material adverse impact on holdings ability to meet its cash obligations due to certain intercompany arrangements 
sources and uses of cash 
during  we i generated cash from operations of including related to a federal tax refund and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and non rental equipment of we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and non rental equipment of and ii fund payments  net of proceeds  on debt of during  we i generated cash from operations of and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and non rental equipment of we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and non rental equipment of  ii fund payments  net of proceeds  on debt of and iii pay aggregate financing costs and costs associated with the convertible hedge transactions of 
table of contents free cash flow gaap reconciliation we define free cash flow as i net cash provided by operating activities less ii purchases of rental and non rental equipment plus iii proceeds from sales of rental and non rental equipment and excess tax benefits from share based payment arrangements  net 
management believes free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements 
however  free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap 
accordingly  free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income loss or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity 
the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow 
year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities purchases of rental equipment purchases of non rental equipment proceeds from sales of rental equipment proceeds from sales of non rental equipment excess tax benefits from share based payment arrangements  net free cash flow free cash flow for the year ended december  was  a decrease of as compared to free cash flow of for the year ended december  as noted above  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  includes a federal tax refund 
excluding the impact of this refund  the year over year decrease in free cash flow primarily reflects increased purchases of rental equipment and reduced proceeds from sales of rental equipment 
in  free cash flow increased compared to this increase reflects lower capital expenditures in  consistent with reduced construction activity in a challenging economic environment  partially offset by lower cash generated from operating activities and decreased proceeds from sales of rental equipment 
certain information concerning contractual obligations 
as discussed above  during  we issued aggregate principal amount of percent senior subordinated notes  and we repurchased or redeemed and subsequently retired certain of our outstanding debt securities 
as a result of this activity  the total scheduled principal debt and capital lease payments decreased from  at december  to  at december  the total interest due on our debt increased from  at december  to  at december   primarily due to additional years of interest obligations associated with the newly issued percent senior subordinated notes  which mature in the table below provides certain information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations as of december  thereafter total debt and capital leases interest due on debt operating leases real estate non rental equipment service agreements purchase obligations subordinated convertible debentures total the payments due with respect to a period represent i in the case of debt and capital leases  the scheduled principal payments due in such period  and ii in the case of operating leases  the minimum lease payments 
table of contents due in such period under non cancelable operating leases plus the maximum potential guarantee amounts associated with some of our non rental equipment operating leases for which we guarantee that the value of the equipment at the end of the lease term will not be less than a specified projected residual value 
estimated interest payments have been calculated based on the principal amount of debt and the effective interest rates as of december  these represent service agreements with third parties to provide wireless and network services  refurbish our aerial equipment  operate the distribution centers associated with contractor supplies and provide equipment appraisals 
as of december   we had outstanding purchase orders  which were negotiated in the ordinary course of business  with our equipment and inventory suppliers 
these purchase commitments can be cancelled by us  generally with days notice and without cancellation penalties 
the equipment and inventory receipts from the suppliers for these purchases and related payments to the suppliers are expected to be completed throughout represents principal and interest payments on the of percent subordinated convertible debentures reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  this information excludes of unrecognized tax benefits  which are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements 
it is not possible to estimate the time period during which these unrecognized tax benefits may be paid to tax authorities 
certain information concerning off balance sheet arrangements 
we lease real estate and non rental equipment under operating leases as a regular business activity 
as part of some of our non rental equipment operating leases  we guarantee that the value of the equipment at the end of the term will not be less than a specified projected residual value 
if the actual residual value for all equipment subject to such guarantees were to be zero  then our maximum potential liability under these guarantees would be approximately under current circumstances we do not anticipate paying significant amounts under these guarantees  however  we cannot be certain that changes in market conditions or other factors will not cause the actual residual values to be lower than those currently anticipated 
in accordance with gaap  this potential liability was not reflected on our balance sheet as of december  or any prior date as we believe that proceeds from the sale of the equipment under these operating leases would approximate the payment obligation 
relationship between holdings and urna 
holdings is principally a holding company and primarily conducts its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary  urna  and subsidiaries of urna 
holdings licenses its tradename and other intangibles and provides certain services to urna in connection with its operations 
these services principally include i senior management services  ii finance and tax related services and support  iii information technology systems and support  iv acquisition related services  v legal services  and vi human resource support 
in addition  holdings leases certain equipment and real property that are made available for use by urna and its subsidiaries 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate debt  ii foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily associated with our canadian operations and iii equity price risk associated with our convertible debt 
interest rate risk 
as of december   we had an aggregate of of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  comprised of of borrowings under the abl facility and of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility 
the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt on december  were i percent for the abl facility and ii percent for the accounts receivable securitization facility 
as of december   based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding  our annual after tax earnings would decrease by approximately for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 
the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility may fluctuate significantly 
for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt  see note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents at december   we had an aggregate of billion of indebtedness that bears interest at fixed rates  including our subordinated convertible debentures 
a one percentage point decrease in market interest rates as of december  would increase the fair value of our fixed rate indebtedness by approximately six percent 
for additional information concerning the fair value and terms of our fixed rate debt  see notes see fair value of financial instruments and to our consolidated financial statements 
currency exchange risk 
the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar 
as a result  our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars 
based upon the level of our canadian operations during relative to the company as a whole  a percent change in this exchange rate would cause our annual after tax earnings to change by approximately as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  during the year ended december   we recognized foreign currency losses of associated with the revaluation of certain canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans  however these losses were offset by gains of recognized on forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars  and the aggregate foreign currency impact of the intercompany loans and forward contracts did not have a material impact on our earnings 
we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 
equity price risk 
in connection with the november issuance of aggregate principal amount of percent convertible senior notes  holdings entered into convertible note hedge transactions with option counterparties 
the convertible note hedge transactions cover  subject to anti dilution adjustments  million shares of our common stock 
the convertible note hedge transactions are intended to reduce  subject to a limit  the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the percent convertible notes 
based on the price of our common stock during the fourth quarter of  holders of the percent convertible notes may convert the notes during the first quarter of at the initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
as of january   none of the percent convertible notes were converted 
the effect of the convertible note hedge transactions is to increase the effective conversion price to approximately per share  equal to an approximately percent premium over the closing price of our common stock at issuance 
however  in the event the market value of our common stock exceeds per share  the settlement amount received from such transactions will only partially offset the potential dilution 
for example  if  at the time of exercise of the conversion right  the price of our common stock was or per share  on a net basis  we would issue million or million shares  respectively
