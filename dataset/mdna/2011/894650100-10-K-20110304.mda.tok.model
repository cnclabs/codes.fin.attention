however  under certain agreements  changes in resin prices are not passed through for an average period of days 
the estimated impact of the lag in the pass through of changes in average resin costs and year end adjustments for inventories accounted for under the last in first out method lifo was a negative million in and a positive million in the estimated unfavorable impact from us dollar value currencies for operations outside the us was million in compared with 
table of contents future operating profit levels within film products will depend upon our ability to design and market new application of our films  to maintain margins associated with new product introductions and growth initiatives and to effectively address competitive pricing pressures and the challenge of competition from substitute materials 
capital expenditures in film products were million in compared to million in  and are projected to be approximately million in depreciation expense was million in compared to million in  and is projected to be approximately million in aluminum extrusions a summary of operating results for aluminum extrusions is provided below in thousands  except percentages year ended december favorable unfavorable change sales volume pounds net sales operating loss from ongoing operations the increase in net sales was due to higher volumes and an increase in average selling prices driven by higher average aluminum costs 
sales volume increased in compared to despite extremely challenging conditions in nonresidential construction 
shipments in nonresidential construction  which comprised of total volume in  were relatively flat in compared with the favorable change in operating losses from ongoing operations in reflects higher volumes in multiple sectors  tightly managed overhead expenses  and the favorable impact in versus of million for adjustments related to inventories accounted for under lifo  partially offset by a less favorable sales mix 
aluminum extrusions continues to concentrate its efforts on controlling costs and effectively managing working capital  as the timing of a meaningful recovery in the us nonresidential construction market remains uncertain 
upon completing an impairment analysis as of march   a goodwill impairment charge of million million after tax was recognized in aluminum extrusions in the prior year 
this impairment charge represents the entire amount of goodwill associated with the aluminum extrusions reporting unit 
for additional detail on this goodwill impairment charge  see note of the notes to the financial statements beginning on page capital expenditures in aluminum extrusions were million in  an million decrease from million in  and are projected to be approximately million in the project to expand capacity at our carthage  tennessee manufacturing facility  which was completed in and increased our capabilities in the nonresidential construction sector  accounted for million of capital expenditures in depreciation expense was million in  compared to million in  and is projected to be million in other in february  we reported an additional segment  other  comprised of the start up operations of bright view and falling springs 
we acquired the assets of bright view  a late stage development company  on february  bright view is a developer and producer of high value microstructure based optical films for the led light emitting diode and fluorescent lighting markets 
falling springs develops  owns and operates multiple mitigation banks 
through the establishment of perpetual easements to restore  enhance and preserve wetlands  streams or other protected environmental resources  these mitigation banks create saleable credits that are used by the purchaser of credits to offset the negative environmental impacts from private and public development projects 
net sales for this segment can fluctuate from quarter to quarter as bright view is a late stage development company and falling springs revenue can vary based upon the timing of development projects within its markets 
operating losses from ongoing operations were million in although these companies are in their relative infancy and currently are incurring operating losses  we are encouraged by their progress in developing new products and sustainable business models 

table of contents corporate expenses  interest and income taxes pension expense was  in  an unfavorable change of million from net pension income recognized in most of the change is reflected in corporate expenses  net in the segment operating profit table presented on page we contributed approximately  to our pension plans in  and minimum required contributions to our pension plans in are expected to be comparable 
pension expense in is estimated at million 
corporate expenses  net in increased in comparison to primarily due to the unfavorable impact of pension expense noted above and adjustments for certain performance based compensation programs 
in june  we entered into a new four year  million unsecured revolving credit facility  which replaced our previous revolving credit facility that was due to expire on december  interest expense  which includes the amortization of debt issue costs  increased by  in the effective tax rate used to compute income taxes was in compared with in the change in the effective tax rate for versus was due to numerous factors as shown in the effective income tax rate reconciliation provided in note on page in  we repurchased million shares of our stock under a standing authorization from our board of directors for million  compared to  shares for million in and million shares for million in our net cash balance cash and cash equivalents of million in excess of total debt of  at december  was million  compared to net cash balance cash and cash equivalents of million in excess of total debt of million at december  of million 
net cash is not intended to represent debt or cash as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  but is utilized by management in evaluating financial leverage and equity valuation and we believe that investors also may find net debt or cash helpful for the same purposes 
consolidated net capitalization and other credit measures are provided in the financial condition section beginning on page critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies 
these policies require management to exercise judgments that are often difficult  subjective and complex due to the necessity of estimating the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
impairment and useful lives of long lived identifiable assets and goodwill we regularly assess our long lived identifiable assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
any necessary impairment charges are recorded when we do not believe the carrying value of the long lived asset will be recoverable 
we also reassess the useful lives of our long lived assets based on changes in our business and technologies 
we assess goodwill for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  on an annual basis december st of each year 
our reporting units include  but are not limited to  film products and aluminum extrusions  each of which may have separately identifiable operating net assets operating assets including goodwill and intangible assets net of operating liabilities 
as of december   film products was the only reporting unit that carried a goodwill balance 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived identifiable assets and goodwill  we estimate fair value using discounted cash flow analysis and comparative enterprise value to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization multiples 
these calculations require us to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  discount rates and other factors to determine if an impairment exists 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 

table of contents based on the severity of the economic downturn and its impact on sales volumes of our aluminum extrusions business a decline in sales volume in the first quarter of compared with the first quarter of  the resulting loss in the first quarter of  possible future losses and the uncertainty in the amount and timing of an economic recovery  we determined that impairment indicators existed in the first quarter of upon completing the impairment analysis as of march   a goodwill impairment charge of million  which represents the entire amount of goodwill associated with aluminum extrusions  was recorded 
based upon assessments performed as to the recoverability of long lived identifiable assets  we have recorded asset impairment losses for continuing operations of  in  million in and million in investment accounted for under the fair value method during the third quarter of  we invested million in a privately held specialty pharmaceutical company 
in the fourth quarter of  we invested an additional million as part of a new round of equity financing completed by the investee 
this investment is accounted for under the fair value method 
we elected the fair value option over the equity method of accounting since our investment objectives are similar to those of venture capitalists  which typically do not have controlling financial interests venture capital funds generally use the fair value method to account for their investment portfolios 
at december   our ownership interest was approximately on a fully diluted basis 
us generally accepted accounting principles requires disclosure of the level within the fair value hierarchy in which fair value measurements in their entirety fall  segregating fair value measurements using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  significant other observable inputs level  and significant unobservable inputs level 
on the dates of our investments august  and december   we believe that the amount we paid for our ownership interest and liquidation preferences was based on level inputs  including investments by other investors 
subsequent to the last round of financing  and until the next round of financing  we believe fair value estimates drop to level inputs since there is no secondary market for our ownership interest 
in addition  the investee currently has no product sales 
accordingly  after the latest financing and until the next round of financing or any other significant financial transaction  fair value estimates will primarily be based on assumptions relating to meeting product development and commercialization milestones  cash flow projections projections of development and commercialization milestone payments  sales  costs  expenses  capital expenditures and working capital investment and discounting of these factors for the high degree of risk 
in connection with the new round of equity financing in the fourth quarter of  we recognized an unrealized gain of million for the write up of this investment based upon the implied valuation of our ownership interest 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized an additional unrealized gain of million for the appreciation of our ownership interest upon the investee entering into an exclusive licensing agreement that included an upfront payment  additional potential milestone payments and tiered royalties on sales of any products commercialized under the license 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized an unrealized loss of million after the investee  which had its new drug application to the food drug administration fda accepted for review during the quarter  reassessed its projected timeframe for obtaining final marketing approval from the fda 
at december  and  the fair value of our investment the carrying value included in other assets and deferred charges in our consolidated balance sheet was million and million  respectively 
the fair market valuation of our interest in the specialty pharmaceutical company is sensitive to changes in the weighted average cost of capital used to discount cash flow projections for the high degree of risk associated with meeting development and commercialization milestones as anticipated 
at december   the effect of a basis point change in the weighted average cost of capital assumption would have increased or decreased the fair value of our interest in the specialty pharmaceutical company by approximately million 
any future changes in the estimated fair value of our ownership interest will likely be attributed to a new round of financing  a merger or initial public offering or adjustments to the timing or magnitude of cash flows associated with development and commercialization milestones 
adjustments to the estimated fair value of our investment will be made in the period upon which such changes can be quantified 

table of contents pension benefits we have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans in our continuing operations that have resulted in varying amounts of net pension income or expense  as developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net pension income or expense recorded in future periods 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future payments 
the discount rate is the single rate that  when applied to expected benefit payments  provides a present value equal to the present value of expected benefit payments determined by using the aa rated bond yield curve 
in general  our liability increases as the discount rate decreases and vice versa 
our weighted average discount rate for continuing operations was at the end of  at the end of and at the end of  with changes between periods due to changes in market interest rates 
based on plan changes announced in  pay for active participants of the plan was frozen as of december  a lower expected return on plan assets increases the amount of expense and vice versa 
decreases in the level of actual plan assets will also serve to increase the amount of pension expense 
the value of our plan assets relating to continuing operations  which is primarily affected by the change in fair value of plan assets and current year payments to participants  increased and  in and  respectively  partially recovering from an million decline in the asset value decline in was primarily due to the drop in global stock prices 
between and  the value of our plan assets relating to continuing operations increased due to improved general market conditions after declining from to our expected long term return on plan assets relating to continuing operations  which is estimated by asset class and generally based on inflation adjusted historical returns  volatilities  risk premiums and managed asset premiums  was in and and from to we anticipate that our expected long term return on plan assets will be for see page for more information on expected long term return on plan assets and asset mix 
see the executive summary beginning on page for further discussion regarding the financial impact of our pension plans 
income taxes on a quarterly basis  we review our judgments regarding uncertain tax positions and the likelihood that the benefits of a deferred tax asset will be realized 
as circumstances change  we reflect in earnings any adjustments to unrecognized benefits for uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
for financial reporting purposes  we had unrecognized tax benefits on uncertain tax positions of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
included in the  and amounts were   and million  respectively  for tax positions for which ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which the timing of deductibility is uncertain 
because of the impact of deferred income tax accounting  other than interest  penalties and deductions not related to timing  a longer deductibility period would not affect the total income tax expense or the annual effective tax rate shown for financial reporting purposes  but would accelerate payments to the taxing authority 
tax payments resulting from the successful challenge by the taxing authority for accelerated deductions taken by us would possibly result in the payment of interest and penalties 
accordingly  we also accrue for possible interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions 
the balance of accrued interest and penalties on deductions taken relating to uncertain tax positions was approximately   and million at december   and  respectively   and  respectively  net of corresponding federal and state income tax benefits 
accruals for possible interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are reflected in income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 

table of contents in  we settled several disputed issues raised by the irs during its examination of our us income tax returns for  the most significant of which regards the recognition of our captive insurance subsidiary as an insurance company for us income tax purposes 
the settlement with the irs for the disputed issues cost us approximately million  which is lower than the previous estimate of million and was applied against the balance of unrecognized tax benefits 
tredegar and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the us  various states  and jurisdictions outside the us generally  except for refund claims and amended returns  tredegar is no longer subject to us federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before with few exceptions  tredegar and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to state or non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before as of december  and  we had valuation allowances relating to deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively

recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force issued a consensus updating accounting standards for revenue recognition for multiple deliverable arrangements in october the stated objective of the accounting standards update was to address the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
the revision of current fasb guidance provides amended methodologies for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements and expands disclosure requirements 
the accounting standards update will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect these fasb rules to have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures 
the fasb issued guidance in january that requires new disclosures for fair value measurements and provides clarification for existing disclosure requirements 
more specifically  this update will require a an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for such transfers  and b information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements to be presented separately ie present the activity on a gross basis rather than net in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level inputs 
this update also clarifies existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation used for classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value and requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements using level and level inputs 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for disclosures about the purchase  sale  issuance and settlement activity of level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for the interim periods in that year 
the adoption of these new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures have not and are not expected to materially expand our current financial statement footnote disclosures 
in march  the patient protection and affordable care act the ppaca was signed into law  as was the health care and education reconciliation act of  which amends certain aspects of the ppaca 
included in the provisions of these laws are changes to the taxation related to the federal subsidy available to companies that provide retiree health benefit plans that include a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefits of medicare part d 
our retiree medical plan does not include prescription drug coverage for medicare eligible retirees  so we are not impacted by changes to the taxation of this federal subsidy 
we will continue to assess the other potential long term impacts  if any  that any amendments or clarifications of this legislation may have on future results of operations  cash flows or financial position related to our health care benefits and postretirement health care obligations  as events warrant
