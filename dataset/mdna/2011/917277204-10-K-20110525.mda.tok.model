item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with  and we qualify our discussion in its entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere within this annual report on form k  the material contained under part  item description of business and part i  item a 
risk factors of this annual report on form k  and the cautionary disclosure about forward looking statements at the front of part i of this of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets innovative  proprietary products for the treatment of voiding dysfunctions 
our primary focus is on two products the urgent pc neuromodulation system  which we believe is the only fda cleared minimally invasive  office based neuromodulation therapy for the treatment of overactive bladder oab and associated symptoms of urinary urgency  urinary frequency  and urge incontinence  and macroplastique  a urethral bulking agent for the treatment of adult female stress urinary incontinence primarily due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency isd 
outside of the us  our urgent pc system is also approved for treatment of fecal incontinence  and macroplastique is also approved for treatment of male stress incontinence and vesicoureteral reflux 
our sales during the past four years have been significantly influenced by the availability of third party reimbursement for ptns treatments 
sales of our urgent pc system grew rapidly during fiscal and with rapid market acceptance of ptns treatments that were reimbursed under a listed current procedure technology cpt code 
however  during the first quarter of our fiscal the american medical association ama advised the medical community that the previously recommended listed cpt code for reimbursement for ptns treatments be replaced with an unlisted cpt code 
as a result  many third party insurers delayed or denied reimbursement for ptns treatments  and sales of our urgent pc system in the us declined from a peak of million in the first quarter of our fiscal to a range of million to million per quarter in the six subsequent fiscal quarters ended december we sponsored several clinical studies  and supported by publication of clinical studies in us peer reviewed journals  we applied for  and the ama granted  a listed category i cpt code for ptns treatments  which became effective in january  our fourth fiscal quarter of the ama advised us of this decision prior to the effective date and we began to expand our sales organization in anticipation of increased reimbursement coverage 
to date  ten regional medicare carriers representing states  with approximately million covered lives  have indicated they will provide coverage for ptns treatments 
three regional medicare carriers representing states  with approximately million covered lives  continue to decline reimbursement coverage for ptns treatments 
we continue to work to have the decision to deny coverage reversed 
in addition  we estimate that to date private payers providing insurance to approximately million lives have elected to provide coverage for ptns treatments 
we are working with the medical directors of a number of other private payers to provide coverage for ptns treatments 
in anticipation of increased interest in our urgent pc system with the assignment of the new cpt code for ptns treatments  we have expanded our us field sales and support organization 
on april  we had employed sales representatives and six independent manufacturer s representatives  and by march   we had employed sales representatives and two independent manufacturer s representatives 
our employed sales representatives generated approximately of our us sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal and in fiscal we expect our employed sales representatives to generate a greater portion of our sales in the future 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts  giving due consideration to materiality 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following can be characterized as critical accounting policies and are particularly important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial position 
these critical policies may require the application of a higher level of judgment by us  and as a result are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of ownership have passed  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
generally  these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped to the customer 
we include in net sales shipping and handling charges that we bill to customers  and include the related shipping and handling costs that we incur in cost of sales 
we present our sales in our income statement net of taxes  such as sales  use  value added and certain excise taxes  collected from the customers and remitted to governmental authorities 
typically our agreements contain no customer acceptance provisions or installation obligations 
we sell our products to clinics  healthcare institutions  physicians and other healthcare providers  and to distributors 
the distributor payment terms are not contingent on the distributor selling the product to end users 
customers do not have the right to return unsold products except for warranty claims 
our distributors purchase our products to meet the sales demand of their end user customers as well as to fulfill their internal requirements associated with the sales process and  if applicable  contractual purchase requirements under the respective distribution agreements 
internal and other requirements include purchases of products for training  demonstration and evaluation purposes  clinical evaluations  product support  establishing inventories  and meeting minimum purchase commitments 
as a result  the level of our net sales during any period is not necessarily indicative of our distributors sales to end user customers during that period  which we estimate are not substantially different than our sales to those distributors in each of the last two years 
our distributors level of inventories of our products  their sales to end user customers and their internal product requirements may impact our future revenue growth 

table of contents accounts receivable 
we carry our accounts receivable at the original invoice amount less an estimated allowance for doubtful receivables based on a periodic review of all outstanding amounts 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the customer s financial health  and both historical and expected credit loss experience 
we write off our accounts receivable when we deem them uncollectible 
we record recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off when received 
we are not always able to accurately or timely anticipate changes in the financial condition of our customers and if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if more allowances are provided than are ultimately required  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on the actual collection experience 
historically  the accounts receivable balances we have written off have generally been within our expectations 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
we provide lower of cost or market reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories based upon current and expected future product sales and the expected impact of product transitions or modifications 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with inventory levels 
while we expect our sales to grow  a reduction in sales could reduce the demand for our products and may require additional inventory reserves 
historically  inventories we have written off have generally been within our expectations 
foreign currency translation transactions 
the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with the provisions of asc foreign currency matters 
we translate all assets and liabilities using period end exchange rates  and we translate statements of operations items using average exchange rates for the period 
we record the resulting translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive loss  a separate component of shareholders equity 
we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses in the statement of operations  including unrealized gains and losses on short term intercompany obligations using period end exchange rates  resulting in an increase in the volatility of our consolidated statements of operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure the recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we use judgment to forecast future cash flows including forecasting revenues and margins  and working capital needs 
if we consider such assets impaired  we measure the impairment to be recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
we did not record any impairment charge in fiscal years or share based compensation 
we account for share based compensation costs under asc  compensation stock compensation 
asc covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
we recognize the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options  in our financial statements 
we measure that cost based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
defined benefit pension plans 
we have a liability attributed to defined benefit pension plans we offered to certain former and current employees of our subsidiaries in the uk and the netherlands 
the liability is dependent upon numerous factors  assumptions and estimates  and the continued benefit costs we incur may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate  mortality  compensation rates  or retirement dates used to determine the projected benefit obligation 
additionally  changes made to the provisions of the plans may impact current and future benefit costs 
in accordance with accounting rules  changes in benefit obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as costs on the income statement  but are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

table of contents income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates we expect to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences 
as of march   we have generated approximately million in us net operating loss carryforwards that we cannot use to offset taxable income in foreign jurisdictions 
we recognize a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that we will not realize a portion of the deferred tax asset 
we have established a valuation allowance for us and certain foreign deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty that we will generate enough income in those taxing jurisdictions to utilize the assets 
in addition  future utilization of nol carryforwards are subject to certain limitations under section of the internal revenue code 
this section generally relates to a percent change in ownership of a company over a three year period 
we believe that each of the issuance of our public offering of common stock in the december and july resulted in an ownership change under section accordingly  our ability to use nol tax attributes generated prior to december and after december and prior to july are limited 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
results of operations net sales 
in fiscal  net sales were million  representing a million or increase compared to net sales of million in fiscal excluding the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  net sales increased by approximately sales to customers in the us in fiscal totaled million  representing a million or increase compared to million in fiscal sales in the us of our urgent pc system increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal sales of our urgent pc system declined from a peak of million in the first quarter of our fiscal to approximately million to million per quarter in the six subsequent quarters ended december because of the reimbursement related issues noted previously 
in the fourth quarter ended march   urgent pc sales in the us were million 
we sold  urgent pc lead set boxes to customers in the fourth quarter ended march  compared to  boxes to customers in the third quarter ended december  we believe the increase in sequential sales of lead set boxes and number of customers in the fourth quarter is attributed primarily to the listed cpt code assigned effective january and expanded third party coverage for ptns treatments 
while we expect the number of customers to continue to increase  we believe the large sequential increase in the fourth quarter ended march  is partially attributed to the pent up demand for our product 
sales in the us of our macroplastique product increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal sales of our macroplastique product increased as a result of our increased sales and marketing focus on this product 
sales to customers outside the us increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal excluding the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  sales increased by approximately 
gross profit gross profit was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  or of net sales in both years 
in fiscal  we had a favorable impact of increase in manufacturing capacity utilization of approximately percentage points and a favorable impact of product mix of approximately percentage points  essentially offset by the negative impacts of changes in the currency exchange rates from our foreign currency denominated sales and the additional costs in the first half of the fiscal year associated with the sourcing of our urgent pc lead sets from a secondary supplier 
general and administrative expenses g a g a expenses of million during fiscal increased  from million during fiscal included in fiscal is a charge of  for non cash  share based compensation expense  compared with  in fiscal excluding share based compensation charges  g a expenses increased by  primarily because of a  increase in incentive compensation costs  a  increase in investor relations and related travel expenses  a  increase in legal and consulting fees  and a recovery of  in fiscal of a previously recorded bad debt expense 
research and development expenses r d r d expenses decreased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal included in fiscal is a  charge for non cash  share based compensation expense  compared with  in fiscal excluding share based compensation charges  r d expenses decreased by  the decrease is attributed primarily to a  decrease in spending for clinical studies  offset partially by a  increase in compensation costs and an increase of  in product design and regulatory costs 

table of contents selling and marketing expenses s m s m expenses of million in fiscal increased million from million in fiscal s m expenses increased primarily because of a million increase in compensation costs as a result of the increase in our us field sales organization  an increase in travel expense of  an increase in commission expenses of  an increase in consulting costs of  and an increase in costs for attending sales conventions of  as the result of the increased interest in our urgent pc after the new cpt code became effective  we expanded our us field sales and support organization in our third quarter 
accordingly  we incurred increased s m expenses during the third and fourth quarters 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles was  in fiscal  and  in fiscal in april  we acquired from cystomedix  inc  certain intellectual property assets related to the urgent pc system for million  which we are amortizing over six years 
other income expense other income expense includes interest income  interest expense  foreign currency exchange gains and losses and other non operating costs when incurred 
net other income was  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
we recognize exchange gains and losses primarily as a result of fluctuations in currency rates between the us dollar the functional reporting currency and the euro and british pound currencies of our subsidiaries  as well as their effect on the dollar denominated short term intercompany obligations between us and our foreign subsidiaries 
we recognized foreign currency exchange gain of  in fiscal and foreign currency exchange loss of  in fiscal income tax expense in fiscal and fiscal  we recorded income tax expense of  and  respectively 
we cannot use our us net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income in foreign jurisdictions 
non gaap financial measures the following table reconciles our operating loss calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap to non gaap financial measures that exclude non cash charges for share based compensation  and depreciation and amortization expenses from gross profit  operating expenses and operating loss 
the non gaap financial measures used by management and disclosed by us are not a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures and consolidated financial results calculated in accordance with gaap  and you should carefully evaluate our reconciliations to non gaap 
we may calculate our non gaap financial measures differently from similarly titled measures used by other companies 
therefore  our non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to those used by other companies 
we have described the reconciliations of each of our non gaap financial measures described above to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
we use these non gaap financial measures  and in particular non gaap operating loss  for internal managerial purposes and incentive compensation for senior management because we believe such measures are one important indicator of the strength and the operating performance of our business 
analysts and investors frequently ask us for this information 
we believe that they use these measures to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in our industry  including as a means of comparing period to period results and as a means of evaluating our results with those of other companies

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
at march   we have total cash and investments of million  which includes million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million of long term investments 
at march   we had working capital of approximately million 
in fiscal  we used million of cash in operating activities  compared to million of cash used in fiscal we attribute the increase in cash used in operating activities primarily to the increase of million in the operating loss  an increase in inventories and receivables due to the increase in sales  offset partially by an increase in accrued liabilities  primarily related to accruals of compensation related expenses 
in fiscal we used approximately  to purchase property  plant and equipment compared with approximately  in fiscal in fiscal we generated proceeds from financing activities of approximately million  consisting of approximately million in net proceeds from the public offering of our common stock and approximately million from the exercise of warrants and options 
in july  in a public offering of our common stock  we issued million shares inclusive of the over allotment exercised by the underwriters at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of million  and net proceeds  after fees and expenses  of approximately million 
we anticipate using the proceeds to expand our us sales and marketing organization to support our urgent pc business and for clinical studies  working capital and general corporate purposes 
as a result of increased interest in our urgent pc after the new cpt code became effective  we expanded our us field sales and support organization 
sources of liquidity 
uroplasty bv  our subsidiary  has an agreement with rabobank of the netherlands for a  approximately  credit line secured by our facility in geleen  the netherlands 
the bank charges interest on the loan at the rate of one percentage point over the rabobank base interest rate base rate on march   subject to a minimum interest rate of per annum 
we had no borrowings outstanding on this credit line at march  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs for beyond the next twelve months 
although we have historically not generated cash from operations because we have yet to achieve profitability  we anticipate that we will become profitable and generate excess cash from operations prior to the full use of the current available cash and investments 
to achieve this however  we must generate substantially more revenue than we have this year or in prior years 
our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend  in large part  on our ability to achieve widespread market acceptance for our products and successfully expand our business in the us  which in turn may be partially dependent upon re establishing broad reimbursement for our urgent pc product and successfully demonstrating the superiority of our macroplastique product to clinicians 
we cannot guarantee that we will be entirely successful in either of these pursuits 
if we fail to meet our projections of profitability and cash flow  or determine to use cash for matters we have not currently projected  we may need to again seek financing to meet our cash needs 
we cannot assure you that such financing  if needed  will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 

table of contents commitments and contingencies 
we expect to continue to incur costs for clinical studies to support our ongoing marketing efforts and to meet regulatory requirements 
we also expect to continue to incur significant expenses to support our us sales and marketing organization  and for regulatory activities 
under a royalty agreement we pay royalties of five percent of net sales of macroplastique in countries where a patent is filed subject to a monthly minimum of  the royalties payable under this agreement will continue until certain patents referenced in the agreement expire in and under a license agreement for the macroplastique implantation system  we pay a royalty of british pounds for each unit sold during the life of the patent 
in our normal course of business we have commitments  generally for periods of less than twelve months  to purchase from various vendors finished goods and manufacturing components under issued purchase orders 
we have a defined benefit pension plan covering seven current and nineteen former employees in the netherlands 
we pay premiums to an insurance company to fund annuities for the current employees 
we are responsible for funding additional annuities based on continued service and future salary increases 
we closed this defined benefit plan for new employees in april as of that date  the netherlands subsidiary established a defined contribution plan that now covers new employees 
we also have a defined benefit pension plan for six former employees of our uk subsidiary 
we closed this plan to further accrual for all employees effective december   and  effective march  established a defined contribution plan that now covers new employees
