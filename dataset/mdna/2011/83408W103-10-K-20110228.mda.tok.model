sponsored search business our sponsored search business is conducted through sohu s online search subsidiary sogou inc sogou via sogou 
com  an interactive proprietary search engine 
sponsored search services provide priority placements in our search directory and pay for click services to customers  especially small and medium sized enterprises 
during  we restructured our sponsored search business in preparation for the sale of sogou s newly issued series a preferred shares to alibaba investment limited alibaba  a private investment subsidiary of alibaba group holding limited  china web search hk limited china web  an investment vehicle of yunfeng fund  lp  and photon group limited photon  the 
table of contents investment fund of sohu s chairman and chief executive officer dr 
charles zhang 
in the restructuring  we transferred to sogou certain assets and liabilities associated with the mobile version of sogou pinyin  and transferred to sohu certain non search assets and liabilities that had been held by sogou 
sogou will remain liable for a loan payable to sohu in the amount of million  which will be payable solely from the proceeds of an initial public offering by sogou 
the loan amount consists primarily of losses historically incurred in our search business and previously funded by sohu 
on october   sogou completed the sale of newly issued series a preferred shares to alibaba  china web and photon for million  million  and million  respectively  that represent approximately  and  respectively  of the outstanding share capital of sogou on a fully diluted basis

as sogou s controlling shareholder  sohu will continue to consolidate sogou but will recognize noncontrolling interest reflecting shares held by shareholders other than sohu 
with its new capital structure in place  sogou is a separate operating entity focused exclusively on its desktop products and online search businesses  which we believe are picking up momentum 
the shareholder group includes not only the alibaba group and sohu  but also sogou s management team 
we believe that this transformation has also helped to further attract talent as well as to build confidence among our business partners  and most importantly our distributors 
we believe that our collaboration with alibaba is progressing well 
wireless and others businesses our wireless and others businesses mainly consist of the wireless business  which offers value added services such as news  weather forecasts  chatting  entertainment information and mobile phone ringtone and logo downloads to mobile phone users 
economy and industry the chinese economy began to experience a slowing growth rate during the global financial crisis in the latter half of in  the chinese government carried out a series of stimulus plans and the chinese economy recovered gradually with gdp growth exceeding 
in  the chinese economy has bottomed out and witnessed a sound recovery with gdp growth at 
heading into  it is forecasted that economy in china will keep a normal gdp growth rate around 
we believe a modest macro environment would provide an attractive opportunity for our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relates to our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the revenue recognition  the share based compensation expense recognition  income taxes and uncertain tax positions  recognition of noncontrolling interest  computation of net income per share  determination of fair value of financial instruments  determination of net accounts receivable  determination of fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired through business combination  accounting for investment in debt securities  accounting for equity investments  assessment of impairment for long lived assets and goodwill  and determination of functional currencies represent critical accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the recognition of revenues involves certain management judgments 
the amount and timing of our revenues could be materially different for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
for a barter transaction involving advertising services  we recognize revenue and expense at fair value only if the fair value of the advertising services surrendered received in the transaction is determinable 
no revenue from advertising for advertising barter transaction is recognized since the fair value cannot be reliably determined 

table of contents brand advertising revenues brand advertising revenues are recognized after deducting agent rebates and applicable business tax 
for brand advertising revenues  a contract is signed to establish the fixed price and advertising services to be provided 
based on the contracts  we provide advertisement placements on our different website channels and or in different formats  including but not limited to banners  links  logos  buttons  rich media and content integration 
for brand advertising revenue recognition  prior to entering into contracts  we make a credit assessment of the customer to assess the collectability of the contract 
for those contracts for which the collectability was assessed as reasonably assured  we recognize revenue ratably over the period during which the advertising services were provided and when all revenue recognition criteria were met 
for those contracts for which the collectability was assessed as not reasonably assured  we recognize revenue only when the cash was received and all other revenue recognition criteria were met 
we treat all elements of advertising contracts as a single unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and recognize such revenue in one time when the last deliverable service in the arrangement was provided 
sponsorship services  which is a type of brand advertising services  is similar to other brand advertising services  but generally involves larger amounts and longer contract periods 
sponsorship services may allow advertisers to sponsor a particular area on our websites  and may include brand affiliation services and or a larger volume of services  and may require some exclusivity or premier placements 
sponsorship services advertisement revenues are normally recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period  provided our obligations under the contract have been met and all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
online game revenues game operation revenues we earn revenues from our current mmorpg operations by providing online services to game players pursuant to the item based revenue model 
under the item based revenue model  game players play games free of charge and are charged for purchases of virtual items 
under the item based revenue model  proceeds received from sales of prepaid cards are initially recorded as receipts in advance 
proceeds from sale of prepaid cards to distributors are deferred when received and  revenue is recognized over the estimated lives of the virtual items purchased or as the virtual items are consumed 
the revenues are recorded net of business tax  sales discounts and rebates to our distributors 
under our item based revenue model  game players can access our games free of charge  but may purchase consumable virtual items  including those with a predetermined expiration time  such as three months  or perpetual items  such as certain costumes that stay bound to a game player for the life of the game 
revenues in relation to consumable virtual items are recognized as they are consumed  as our services in connection with these items have been fully rendered to our game players as of that time 
revenues in relation to perpetual virtual items are recognized over their estimated lives 
we will provide continual online game services in connection with these perpetual virtual items until they are no longer used by our game players 
we have considered the average period that game players typically play our games and other game player behavior patterns to arrive at our best estimates for the lives of these perpetual virtual items 
we have also considered that the estimated lives of perpetual virtual items may be affected by various factors  including the acceptance and popularity of expansion packs  promotional events launched and market conditions 
however  given the relatively short operating history of our games  and of our most popular game tlbb in particular  our estimate of the period that game players typically play our games may not accurately reflect the estimated lives of the perpetual virtual items 
we have adopted a policy of assessing the estimated lives of perpetual virtual items on a quarterly basis 
all paying users data collected since the launch of the games are used to perform the relevant assessments 
historical behavior patterns of these paying users during the period between their first log on date and last log on date are used to estimate the lives of perpetual virtual items 
while we believe our estimates to be reasonable based on available game player information  we may revise such estimates in the future as our games operation periods become longer and we continue to gain more operating history and data 
any adjustments arising from changes in the estimates of the lives of perpetual virtual items would be applied prospectively on the basis that such changes are caused by new information indicating a change in the game player behavior patterns 
any changes in our estimate of lives of perpetual virtual items may result in our revenues being recognized on a basis different from prior periods and may cause our operating results to fluctuate 

table of contents overseas licensing revenues we also derive revenues from licensing our games in other countries and territories 
the licensing agreements provided for two revenue streams  an initial license fee and a monthly revenue based royalty based on monthly revenues from the games 
the initial license fee consists of both a fixed amount and additional amounts receivable upon achieving certain sales targets 
since we are required to provide when and if available upgrades to the licensees during the license period  both the fixed portion and the additional portion of the initial license fee are recognized ratably as revenue over the license period 
the fixed portion of the initial license fee is recognized ratably over the remaining license period from the date the game is launched  and the additional portion of the initial license fee is recognized ratably over the remaining license period from the date such additional amount is certain 
the monthly usage based royalty fee is recognized when earned  provided that collectability is reasonably assured 
sponsored search revenues sponsored search services mainly include priority placement services and pay for click services 
the priority placement services are placed in our search directory and are normally provided for a fixed fee over the service period of the contracts 
pay for click services mainly consist of displaying the text based links of our advertisers on our websites and our website alliance network 
sponsored search contracts are normally for relatively small amounts and are signed with small and medium sized enterprises 
revenue for the priority placement services is normally recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period  provided our obligations under the contract have been met and all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenue for pay for click services is recognized on a per click basis when the users click on the displayed links 
the priority of the display of text based links is based on the bidding price of different advertisers 
wireless and others revenues our wireless and others revenues are mainly from our wireless business 
wireless revenues are derived from a wide range of wireless products focused on entertainment  information and communications  such as short messaging services sms  ring back tone rbt  wireless application protocol wap  multi media messaging services mms and interactive voice response ivr 
we mainly offer news  weather forecasts  chatting  entertainment information  mobile phone ring tones  and logo downloads and various other mobile related services to mobile phone users through contracts signed with third party mobile network operators 
we contract with china mobile and its subsidiaries and china unicom and its subsidiaries china mobile network operators for billing  collection and transmission services offered to their users 
we also contract with other service providers to obtain content and to distribute our wireless products 
in addition  we purchase certain content from third party content providers 
in most of these arrangements  the fees payable to the third party service and content providers are calculated based on certain percentages of the revenue earned after deducting the fees paid to china mobile network operators 

table of contents wireless service fees are charged on a monthly or per message download basis 
due to the technical issues with the operator s network  we might be unable to collect certain wireless service fees from an operator in certain circumstances 
this un collectability is referred to as the failure rate  which can vary from operator to operator 
wireless revenues are recognized in the month in which the service is performed  provided that no significant obligations remain 
to recognize wireless revenue  we rely on china mobile network operators to provide us the billing confirmations for the actual amount of services they have billed to their mobile customers 
at the end of each reporting period  when an operator has not provided us the monthly billing confirmations  we use the information generated from our internal system as well as the historical data to estimate the failure rate  to estimate the amount of collectable wireless service fees and to recognize revenue 
in the later period when we get the actual billing confirmation  we then record a true up accounting adjustment 
although we believe we have the ability to make reasonable estimates  the differences between the actual facts and our estimations may result in significant fluctuations in the amount and timing of the revenue recognized 
for the three months ended december   of our estimated wireless revenues were confirmed by the monthly billing confirmations received from the mobile network operators 
generally  i within to days after the end of each month  we receive billing confirmations from each of the operators confirming the amount of wireless service charges billed to that operator s mobile phone users and ii within to days after delivering billing confirmations  each operator remits the wireless service fees  net of its service fees  for the month to us 
our management must determine whether to record our wireless revenues using the gross or net method of reporting 
determining whether revenue should be reported gross or net is based on an assessment of various factors  the primary factors being whether we are acting as the principal in offering services to the customer or whether we are acting as an agent in the transaction and the specific requirements of each contract 
currently  a majority of our wireless revenues are recorded on a gross basis  as we have the primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the wireless services 
to the extent we are acting as a principal in a transaction  we report as revenue payments received on a gross basis  and report as costs of revenue amounts attributable to services provided by mobile network operators and other vendors 
to the extent we are acting as an agent in a transaction  we report on a net basis as revenue payments received 
whether we are serving as principal or agent in a transaction is judgmental in nature and is determined by evaluating the terms of the arrangement 
share based compensation expense share based compensation expense is for share based awards  including common stock ordinary shares  share options  restricted shares and restricted share units  granted by sohu and changyou to their employees and directors 
share based compensation expense is recognized as costs and or expenses in the consolidated financial statements based on the fair values of the related share based awards on their grant dates 
for share based awards granted by sohu  in determining the fair value of share options granted  the black scholes valuation model is applied  in determining the fair value of restricted share units granted  the public market price of the underlying shares on the grant dates is applied 
for share based awards granted by changyou  in determining the fair value of ordinary shares  restricted shares and restricted share units granted in  the income approach discounted cash flow method with a discount for lack of marketability was applied  given that the shares underlying the awards were not publicly traded at the time of grant 
in determining the fair value of restricted share units granted in before changyou s initial public offering  the fair value of the underlying shares was determined based on changyou s offering price for its initial public offering 
in determining the fair value of restricted share units granted after changyou s initial public offering  the public market price of the underlying shares on the grant dates is applied 
share based compensation expense for the ordinary shares granted is fully recognized in the quarter during which these ordinary shares are granted 
share based compensation expense for share options  restricted shares and restricted share units granted is recognized on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period 
the number of share based awards for which the service is not expected to be rendered over the requisite period is estimated  and the related compensation expense is not recorded for that number of awards 

table of contents the assumptions used in share based compensation expense recognition represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
if factors change or different assumptions are used  our share based compensation expense could be materially different for any period 
moreover  the estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value that ultimately will be realized by employees who receive equity awards  and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by us for accounting purposes 
income taxes and uncertain tax positions income taxes income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach which requires the recognition of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on available evidence  it is considered that it is more likely than not that some portion of or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider factors including i future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  ii future profitability  and iii tax planning strategies 
our deferred tax assets are related to net operating losses of sohu that would be subject to corporate income tax in the united states us corporate income tax  and net operating losses and temporary differences between accounting and tax basis for our china based subsidiaries and vies that are subject to corporate income tax in the prc under the cit law prc corporate income tax 
substantially all of our income is earned through china based subsidiaries and vies 
in the foreseeable future we do not intend to repatriate income to the united states us where it would be subject to us corporate income tax  except that  under certain circumstances  we may repatriate to the us income that will be subject to the us alternative minimum tax 
in the foreseeable future  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets resulting from the net operating losses of sohu will not be realized 
hence  we recorded a valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets in order to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
if events were to occur in the future that would allow us to realize more of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount  an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax assets that would increase income for the period when those events occurred 
if events were to occur in the future that would require us to realize less of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount  an adjustment would be made to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that would decrease income for the period when those events occurred 
significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
uncertain tax positions in order to assess uncertain tax positions  we apply a more likely than not threshold and a two step approach for the tax position measurement and financial statement recognition 
for the two step approach  the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest is the portion of economic interest in sohu s majority owned subsidiaries and vies which is not attributable  directly or indirectly  to sohu 
currently  the noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements mainly consists of noncontrolling interest for changyou and sogou 

table of contents noncontrolling interest for changyou to reflect the economic interest in changyou held by shareholders other than sohu noncontrolling shareholders  changyou s net income attributable to these noncontrolling shareholders is recorded as noncontrolling interest in sohu s consolidated statements of operations  based on their share of the economic interests in changyou 
changyou s cumulative results of operations attributable to these noncontrolling shareholders  along with its changes in shareholders equity and adjustment for share based compensation expense in relation to those share based awards which are unvested and vested but not yet settled  are recorded as noncontrolling interest in sohu s consolidated balance sheets 
noncontrolling interest for sogou to reflect the economic interest in sogou held by shareholders other than sohu noncontrolling shareholders  sogou s net income loss attributable to these noncontrolling shareholders is recorded as noncontrolling interest in sohu s consolidated statements of operations 
sogou s cumulative results of operations attributable to these noncontrolling shareholders  along with these shareholders original investments in series a preferred shares  is accounted for as a noncontrolling interest classified as permanent equity in sohu s consolidated balance sheets  as its redemption is solely within the control of sohu 
these treatments are based on the terms governing investment by the noncontrolling shareholders in the series a preferred shares of sogou the sogou series a terms and the terms of sogou s restructuring 
by virtue of the sogou series a terms and the terms of the restructuring  as sogou loses money after its restructuring  the net losses will be allocated in the following order i net losses will be allocated to sohu until its basis in sogou decreases to zero  ii additional net losses will be allocated to noncontrolling shareholders until their investment in sogou decreases to zero  and iii further net losses will be allocated between sohu and noncontrolling shareholders based on their shareholding percentage in sogou 
any subsequent net income from sogou will be allocated in the following order i net income will be allocated between sohu and noncontrolling shareholders based on their shareholding percentage in sogou until their basis in sogou increases to zero  ii additional net income will be allocated to noncontrolling shareholders to bring their basis back  iii further net income will be allocated to sohu to bring its basis back  and iv further net income will be allocated between sohu and noncontrolling shareholders based on their shareholding percentage in sogou 
net income per share basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and  if dilutive  potential common shares outstanding during the period 
potential common shares comprise shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement of share based awards using the treasury stock method 
the computation of diluted net income per share does not assume conversion  exercise  or contingent issuance of securities that would have an anti dilutive effect ie  an increase in earnings per share amounts or a decrease in loss per share amounts on net income per share 
additionally  for purposes of calculating the numerator of diluted net income per share  the net income attributable to sohu is adjusted for two factors as following difference between changyou s net income attributable to sohu determined by i the percentage of the total economic interest in changyou held by sohu  and ii the percentage of the weighted average number of changyou shares held by sohu to the weighted average number of changyou ordinary shares and shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement of share based awards under the treasury stock method 
difference between sogou s net income loss attributable to sohu determined by i the sogou series a terms and the terms of sogou s restructuring  and ii the percentage of the weighted average number of sogou shares held by sohu to the weighted average number of sogou ordinary shares and shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible preferred shares under the if converted method 

table of contents fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  investment in debt securities  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the carrying amount of accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their fair value 
other financial instruments are measured at their respective fair values 
for fair value measurement  us gaap establishes a three tier hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value level observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace 
level unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity 
the fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
accounts receivable  net the carrying value of accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected 
we make estimations of the collectability of accounts receivable 
in estimating the general allowance  many factors are considered  including but not limited to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable  performing aging analysis and customer credit analysis  and analyzing historical bad debt records and current economic trends 
additional allowance for specific doubtful accounts might be made if the financial conditions of our customers or mobile network operators deteriorate or the mobile network operators are unable to collect fees from their end customers  resulting in their inability to make payments due to us 
investment in debt securities we invest our excess cash in certain debt securities of high quality corporate issuers 
we elected the fair value option to account for our investments in debt securities at their initial recognition  and recorded changes in fair value in other income expenses 
the fair value election was made to mitigate accounting mismatches and to achieve operational simplifications 
equity investments investments in entities over which we have significant influence but do not control are recorded as equity investments and are accounted for by the equity method 
under this method  our share of the post acquisition profits or losses of the equity investment is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations  and our share of post acquisition movements in equity investments is recognized in equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
unrealized gains on transactions between our and our equity investments are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the equity investments 
unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred 
when our share of losses in an equity investment equals or exceeds our interest in the equity investment  we do not recognize further losses  unless we have incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the equity investee 
long lived assets long lived assets include fixed assets  intangible assets and prepaid non current assets 
fixed assets fixed assets mainly comprise computer equipment and hardware  office building  investment properties  leasehold improvements  vehicles and office furniture 
fixed assets are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation with no residual value 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 

table of contents intangible assets intangible assets primarily comprise computer software  domain names  trademarks  marketing rights  source codes  operating rights for licensed games  and computer software purchased from unrelated third parties 
intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization with no residual value

prepaid non current assets prepaid non current assets primarily include prepayments for the office buildings to be built as sohu s and changyou s headquarters before they were recognized as fixed assets  also included are prepaid content and license fees 
we amortize content and license fees over the shorter of the terms of the applicable licensing period or the estimated period over which the benefits of the licensing contract will be enjoyed 
impairment of long lived assets the carrying values of long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of long lived assets using the projected discounted cash flow method 
the estimation of future cash flows requires significant management judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and is subject to many factors 
the discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model is determined by our management 
an impairment charge would be recorded if we determined that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying values of the assets exceed the fair values of the assets 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as a result of our acquisitions of interests in our subsidiaries and vies 
goodwill is not depreciated or amortized but is tested for impairment at reporting unit level business segment on an annual basis  and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of goodwill with its carrying value 
application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
the judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit

table of contents impact of recently issued accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance on revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
by providing another alternative for determining the selling price of deliverables  the guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables will allow companies to allocate consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements in a manner that better reflects the transaction s economics and will often result in earlier revenue recognition 
the new guidance modifies the fair value requirements of previous guidance by allowing best estimate of selling price in addition to vendor specific objective evidence vsoe and other vendor objective evidence voe  now referred to as tpe  standing for third party evidence for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
a vendor is now required to use its best estimate of the selling price when vsoe or tpe of the selling price cannot be determined 
in addition  the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration is no longer permitted under the new guidance 
the new guidance for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements removes non software components of tangible products and certain software components of tangible products from the scope of existing software revenue guidance  resulting in the recognition of revenue similar to that for other tangible products 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  however  companies may adopt the guidance as early as interim periods ended september  the guidance may be applied either prospectively from the beginning of the fiscal year for new or materially modified arrangements or retrospectively

any resulting goodwill impairment should be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the period of adoption 
any goodwill impairments occurring after the initial adoption of the revised guidance should be included in earnings as required by section the revised guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk while our reporting currency is the us dollar  to date the majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in rmb and a significant portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in rmb 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the rmb 
if the rmb depreciates against the us dollar  the value of our rmb revenues and assets as expressed in our us dollar financial statements will decline 
we do not hold any derivative or other financial instruments that expose us to substantial market risk 
see risk factors we may suffer currency exchange losses if the rmb depreciates relative to the us dollar 

table of contents the rmb is currently freely convertible under the current account  which includes dividends  trade and service related foreign exchange transactions  but not under the capital account  which includes foreign direct investment 
in addition  commencing on july   china reformed its exchange rate regime by changing to a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies 
under the managed floating exchange rate regime  the rmb is no longer pegged to the us dollar 
the exchange rate of the rmb against the us dollar was adjusted to rmb per us dollar as of july   representing an appreciation of about 
the people s bank of china will announce the closing prices of foreign currencies such as the us dollar traded against the rmb in the inter bank foreign exchange market after the closing of the market on each business day  and will make such prices the central parity for trading against the rmb on the following business day 
on may   the people s bank of china announced a policy to expand the maximum daily floating range of rmb trading prices against the us dollar in the inter bank spot foreign exchange market from to 
while the international reactions to the rmb revaluation and widening of the rmb s daily trading band have generally been positive  with the increased floating range of the rmb s value against foreign currencies  the rmb may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the us dollar or other foreign currencies in the long term  depending on the fluctuation of the basket of currencies against which it is currently valued 
on june   the people s bank of china announced that it has decided to proceed further with the reform of the rmb exchange rate regime to enhance the flexibility of the rmb exchange rate and that emphasis would be placed on reflecting market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies 
while so indicating its intention to make the rmb s exchange rate more flexible  the people s bank of china ruled out any sharp fluctuations in the currency or a one off adjustment 
shortly after this announcement  the center point of the currency s official trading band broke through the barrier to hit to the us dollar  it broke through the barrier to hit in january  the appreciation is in total  which is the highest center point of the past five years 
as a result of the announcement  the rmb may appreciate or depreciate more significantly in value against the us dollar or other foreign currencies in the long term  depending on the market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future  the effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure 
accordingly  we may incur economic losses in the future due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the following table sets forth a summary of our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments as of december   which consisted of cash and cash equivalents  investment in debt securities  account receivables  prepaid and other current assets  and current liabilities 
the maturity of those financial instruments was less than one year and their book value approximated fair value 
denominated in in thousands us rmb hk total cash and cash equivalents investment in debt securities account receivables prepaid and other current assets current liabilities interest rate risk the basic objectives of our investment program are to protect the invested funds from excessive risk and to provide for liquidity that is sufficient to meet operating and investment cash requirements 
under the investment policy  our excess cash is invested in high quality securities which are limited as to length of time to maturity and the amount of credit exposure 
our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to the interest income generated from excess cash invested in demand deposits and debt securities 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio in order to reduce this risk 
we have not been exposed nor do we anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates 

table of contents inflation rate risk according to the national bureau of statistics of china  the change in the consumer price index in china was  negative and positive in  and  respectively 
although this rate of inflation was within a manageable range  there may be significant inflation in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our business
