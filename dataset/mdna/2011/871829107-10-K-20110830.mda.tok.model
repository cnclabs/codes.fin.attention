item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants  healthcare and educational facilities  lodging establishments and other foodservice customers 
our operations are primarily located throughout the united states  canada and ireland and include broadline companies  custom cut meat operations  specialty produce companies  hotel supply operations  sygma our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary and a company that distributes to international customers 
we consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the united states and canada and estimate that we serve about of this approximately billion annual market 
according to industry sources  the foodservice  or food away from home  market represents approximately of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the united states 
this share grew from about in to nearly in and did not change materially until when it declined to the current level of 
industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the united states experienced a real sales decline of approximately in calendar year and in calendar year real sales declines do not include the impact of inflation or deflation 
general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food away from home and  in turn  can impact our customers and our sales 
we believe the current general economic conditions  including pressure on consumer disposable income  have contributed to a decline in the foodservice market 
historically  we have grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and have grown our market share in this fragmented industry 
highlights a slow economic recovery in the united states  combined with rising product cost inflation and continued low levels of consumer confidence  contributed to a challenging business environment in fiscal sales increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal  however  gross profit dollars grew at a slower rate than sales and operating expenses increased faster than gross profit partially due to a significant charge of million from a withdrawal from a multi employer pension plan 
this resulted in a decline in operating income for fiscal as compared to fiscal comparisons between fiscal and fiscal are impacted by the presence of a rd week in fiscal sysco s fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to june th 
this resulted in a week year ending july   a week year ending july  for fiscal and a week year ending june  our results of operations discussion includes reconciliations of the actual results for fiscal to the adjusted results for fiscal based on a week fiscal year due to the impact of the week year in fiscal the following table sets forth the change in certain components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over fiscal on both a week basis  or gaap basis  and an adjusted week basis increase increase decrease decrease on an on a gaap basis adjusted basis sales operating income net earnings basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share sales were billion in fiscal  an increase of from the comparable prior year period

operating income was billion  a decrease from the prior year 
after adjusting for the estimated impact of the rd week in fiscal  this decrease would have been 
this adjusted decrease was primarily driven by gross profit dollars growing at a slower rate than sales and operating expenses increasing faster than gross profit partially due to a significant charge of million from a withdrawal from a multi employer pension plan 
gross profit dollars increased in fiscal from the comparable prior year period but declined as a percentage of sales 
this result was primarily due to the impact of significant inflation in certain product categories and strategic pricing initiatives 
operating expenses increased primarily due to higher pay related expense  an increase in net company sponsored pension costs  provisions for withdrawal from multi employer pension plans and higher fuel costs as compared to the prior year period 
the impact of these factors on operating expenses was partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses resulting from the absence of the rd week in fiscal net earnings were billion  an decrease from the prior year 
after adjusting for the estimated impact of the rd week in fiscal  the decrease would have been 
this adjusted decrease was primarily due to the factors discussed above and an increase in the effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was  compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal the difference between the tax rates for the two periods resulted largely from the one time reversal of interest accruals for tax contingencies related to our settlement with the internal revenue service irs in the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal were  a decrease of from the comparable prior year period 
after adjusting for the estimated impact of the rd week in fiscal  this would have been an increase of 
this adjusted increase is primarily a result of the factors discussed above 
basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal were favorably impacted by two items 
first  we recognized a favorable impact of per share due to the gains recorded on the adjustment of the carrying value of corporate owned life insurance coli policies to their cash surrender values 
second  a favorable impact of per share was recognized related to the recognition of deferred tax assets from the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on state net operating loss carryforwards 
these favorable impacts were partially offset by per share relating to the charge recorded upon withdrawal from a multi employer pension plan in the third quarter 
basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal were favorably impacted by per share due to the one time reversal of a previously accrued liability related to the settlement of an outstanding tax matter with the irs and per share due to gains recorded on the adjustment of the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values 
trends and strategy trends general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food away from home and  in turn  can impact our customers and our sales 
we believe the current general economic conditions  including pressure on consumer disposable income  have contributed to a slow rate of recovery in the foodservice market 
we have experienced higher levels of product cost inflation this fiscal year as compared to fiscal while we are generally able to pass on modest levels of inflation to our customers  we were unable to pass through fully these higher levels of product cost inflation with the same gross profit percentage without negatively impacting our customers business and therefore our business 
while we cannot predict whether inflation will continue at current levels  periods of high inflation  either overall or in certain product categories  can have a negative impact on us and our customers  as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the food away from home market  and may negatively impact our sales  gross profit  operating income and earnings 
we have also experienced higher operating costs this fiscal year from increased pay related expense due to increased sales and gross profit as well as higher pension and fuel costs 
we believe pay related expense could continue to increase if sales and gross profit increase  as a portion of these costs is variable in nature 
pension costs will decrease in fiscal primarily due to higher returns on assets of sysco s company sponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan during fiscal fuel costs are expected to increase in fiscal as a result of anticipated higher fuel prices 
our business transformation project is a key part of our strategy to control costs and continue to grow our business 
we believe expenses related to the project will increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal as we prepare to begin deployment of the project to our operating companies and increase our headcount in our shared services center 
strategy we are focused on optimizing our core broadline business in the us and canada  while continuing to explore appropriate opportunities to profitably grow our market share and create shareholder value through adjacent and international businesses 
day to day  our business decisions are driven by our mission to market and deliver great products to our customers with exceptional service  with the aspiration of becoming each of our customers most valued business partner 
we have identified five strategies to help us achieve our mission and vision profoundly enriching the experience of doing business with sysco our primary focus is to help our customers succeed 
we believe that by building on our current competitive advantages  we will be able to further differentiate our offering to customers 
our competitive advantages include our sales force of over  marketing associates  our diversified product base  which includes quality assured sysco brand products  the suite of services we provide to our customers such as business reviews and menu analysis  and our wide geographic presence in the united states and canada 
in addition  we have a portfolio of businesses spanning broadline  specialty meat  chain restaurant distribution  specialty produce  hotel amenities and export which serves our customers needs across a wide array of business segments 
we believe this strategy of enriching the experience of doing business with sysco will increase customer retention and profitably accelerate sales growth with both existing and new customers 
continuously improving productivity in all areas of our business this includes removing costs from our operations through improved productivity without impacting our service to our customers 
in particular  we continue to optimize warehouse and delivery activities across the corporation to achieve a more efficient delivery of products to our customers 
our multi year business transformation project is designed to help further improve productivity 
in this project  we are developing and implementing an integrated software system to support a majority of our business processes to further streamline our operations and reduce costs 
these systems are commonly referred to as enterprise resource planning erp systems 
we view the technology as an important enabler of this project  however the larger outcome of this project will be from transformed processes that standardize portions of our operations 
this includes a shared business service center to centrally manage certain back office functions that are currently performed at each operating company location 
expanding our portfolio of products and services by initiating a customer centric innovation program we continually explore opportunities to provide new and improved products  technologies and services to our customers 
exploring  assessing and pursuing new businesses and markets this strategy is focused on identifying opportunities to expand the core business through growth in new international markets and in adjacent areas that complement our core foodservice distribution business 

table of contents as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis  we regularly evaluate business opportunities  including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses 
developing and effectively integrating a comprehensive  enterprise wide talent management process our ability to drive results and grow our business is directly linked to having the best talent in the industry 
we are committed to the continued enhancement of our talent management programs in terms of how we recruit  select  train and develop our associates throughout sysco as well as succession planning 
our ultimate objective is to provide our associates with outstanding opportunities for professional growth and career development 
business transformation project in fiscal  we substantially completed the design and build phases of our multi year business transformation project and we are testing the underlying erp system and processes through a pilot implementation 
we took more time to test the underlying erp system and processes in fiscal than we originally anticipated 
our pilot operating company implemented the project and our shared services center became active in its support role in the fourth quarter of fiscal we are also taking additional time in fiscal to improve the underlying systems prior to larger scale deployment 
these actions have caused a delay in the project of approximately six to twelve months and until we reach the point where the underlying system functions as intended  our deployment timeline is still being determined 
although we expect the investment in the business transformation project to provide meaningful benefits to the company over the long term  the costs will exceed the benefits during the testing and deployment stages of implementation  including fiscal gross project expenses related to the business transformation project were million in fiscal or per share  million in fiscal or per share and million in fiscal or per share 
our cash outlay for fiscal was million  of which approximately million was capitalized 
provided the improvements needed in the underlying systems are obtained in the first half of fiscal  we anticipate the software will be ready for its intended use in the second half of fiscal  which will result in reduced capitalization as compared to fiscal and increased expense from both software amortization and deployment costs 
we will also incur increased costs from the ramp up of our shared services center  continuing costs for additional phases of our business transformation project and information technology support costs 
some of these increased costs will be partially offset by benefits obtained from the project  primarily in reduced headcount  however the costs will not exceed the benefits in fiscal we expect our gross project expenses related to the business transformation project for fiscal to be approximately million to million and capital expenditures to be approximately million to million

this resulted in a week year ending july   a week year ending july  for fiscal and a week year june  for because the fourth quarter of fiscal contained an additional week as compared to fiscal  our results of operations for fiscal are not directly comparable to the current or prior year 
management believes that adjusting the fiscal results of operations for the estimated impact of the additional week provides more comparable financial results on a year over year basis 
as a result  the results of operations discussion for fiscal presented below in certain instances discusses operating items that have been adjusted by one fourteenth of the total metric for the fourth quarter  except as otherwise noted with respect to adjusted diluted earnings per share 
failure to make these adjustments would cause the year over year changes in certain metrics such as sales  operating income  net earnings and diluted earnings per share to be overstated  whereas in certain cases  a metric may actually have increased rather than declined or declined rather than increased on a more comparable year over year basis 
our results of operations discussion includes reconciliations of the actual results for fiscal to the adjusted results for fiscal based on a week fiscal year 
sales sales for fiscal were higher in fiscal than fiscal after adjusting for the estimated impact of the rd week in fiscal  the increase in sales in fiscal would have been

estimated product cost increases  an internal measure of inflation  were approximately during fiscal sales from acquisitions in the last months favorably impacted sales by for fiscal the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively impacted sales by compared to fiscal sales for fiscal  in addition to the positive impact of the extra week in fiscal  were increased by improving case volumes 
the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively impacted sales by compared to fiscal sales from acquisitions within the last months favorably impacted sales by for fiscal product cost deflation and the resulting decrease in selling prices had a significant impact on sales levels in fiscal estimated changes in product costs  an internal measure of deflation or inflation  were estimated as deflation of during fiscal a change in customer sales mix as compared to fiscal also negatively impacted fiscal sales 
case volumes increased at a greater rate within our contract based customer group which generally receives lower pricing for higher volume 

table of contents operating income cost of sales primarily includes our product costs  net of vendor consideration  and includes in bound freight 
operating expenses include the costs of facilities  product handling  delivery  selling and general and administrative activities 
fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit  fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses 
operating income decreased in fiscal over fiscal to billion  and as a percentage of sales  declined to of sales 
after adjusting for the estimated impact of the rd week in fiscal  the decrease in operating income in fiscal over fiscal would have been 
this adjusted decrease was primarily driven by gross profit dollars growing at a slower rate than sales and operating expenses increasing faster than gross profit partially due to a significant charge of million from a withdrawal from a multi employer pension plan 
gross profit dollars increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and operating expenses increased in fiscal operating income increased in fiscal from fiscal to billion  and as a percentage of sales  increased to of sales 
after adjusting for the estimated impact of the rd week in fiscal  the increase in operating income in fiscal over fiscal would have been 
this adjusted increase in operating income was primarily driven by a decrease in operating expenses 
gross profit dollars increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  while operating expenses decreased in fiscal set forth below is a reconciliation of actual operating income to adjusted operating income for the periods presented see further discussion at impact of week fiscal year in fiscal above weeks in thousands operating income for the week periods estimated operating income for the additional week in fiscal adjusted operating income actual percentage decrease increase adjusted percentage decrease increase gross profit dollars increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to increased sales  partially offset by the negative comparison of the additional week included in fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of sales  was in fiscal  a decline of basis points from the gross profit as a percentage of sales of in fiscal this decline in gross profit percentage was primarily the result of the following factors described in the paragraphs below 
first  sysco s product cost inflation was estimated as inflation of during fiscal based on our product sales mix for fiscal  we were most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the dairy  meat and seafood product categories in the range of to 
our largest selling product category  canned and dry  experienced inflation of 
while we are generally able to pass through modest levels of inflation to our customers  we were unable to pass through fully these higher levels of product cost inflation with the same gross profit percentage in these product categories without negatively impacting our customers business and therefore our business 
while we cannot predict whether inflation will continue at these levels  prolonged periods of high inflation  either overall or in certain product categories  can have a negative impact on us and our customers  as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the food away from home market  and may negatively impact our sales  gross profit and earnings 
second  ongoing strategic pricing initiatives in fiscal lowered our prices to our customers in certain product categories in order to increase sales volumes 
these initiatives are being phased in over time and resulted in short term gross profit declines as a percentage of sales  but we believe will result in long term gross profit dollar growth due to higher sales volumes and increased market share 
we have experienced meaningful year over year volume growth with those items included in the early phases of these programs in the geographies where this program has been implemented 
we believe the long term benefits of these strategic initiatives will result in profitable market share growth 
third  gross profit dollars for fiscal increased as a result of higher fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges were approximately million higher in fiscal than in the comparable prior year period due to higher fuel prices incurred during fiscal and the application of fuel surcharges to a broader customer base for a small portion of the third quarter and the entire fourth quarter 
assuming that fuel prices do not greatly vary from recent levels experienced in the second half of fiscal  we expect fuel surcharges to largely offset our increased fuel costs expected in fiscal gross profit dollars increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the additional week included in fiscal in addition  gross profit reflected product cost deflation in fiscal as compared to product cost inflation in fiscal we may be negatively impacted by prolonged periods of product cost deflation because a significant portion of our sales are at prices based on the cost of products sold plus a percentage markup 
as a result  our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation  even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 
gross profit dollars for fiscal were also impacted by lower fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges were approximately million lower in fiscal than fiscal operating expenses for fiscal increased primarily due to higher pay related expense  an increase in net company sponsored pension costs  provisions for withdrawal from multi employer pension plans and higher fuel costs as compared to the prior year period 
the 
table of contents impact of these operating expense increases was partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses of approximately million resulting from the absence of the rd week in fiscal operating expenses for fiscal were lower than in fiscal primarily due to reduced fuel costs and a favorable comparison on the amounts recorded to adjust the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values in both periods 
partially offsetting these operating expense declines were increases in pay related expenses  net company sponsored pension costs and approximately million of expense associated with the additional week included in fiscal pay related expenses  excluding labor costs associated with our business transformation project  increased by million in fiscal over fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased sales and gross profit  which resulted in increased delivery personnel costs and sales compensation 
portions of our pay related expense are variable in nature and are expected to increase when sales and gross profit increase 
pay related expenses from acquired companies and changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars also contributed to the increase 
partially offsetting these increases were lower provisions for current management incentive bonuses of million 
pay related expenses  excluding labor costs associated with our business transformation project  increased by million in fiscal over fiscal the fiscal increase was primarily due to increased provisions for management incentive accruals and cost associated with the additional week included in fiscal partially offsetting these increases were lower pay related expenses due to reduced headcount 
the criteria for paying annual bonuses to our corporate officers and certain portions of operating company management bonuses are tied to overall company performance 
in fiscal  the overall company performance criteria for payment of such bonuses was met  therefore  the provision for current management incentive bonuses was higher in fiscal than in fiscal when the company assessed it did not meet the criteria for paying certain annual bonuses 
headcount declines occurred in fiscal due to both productivity improvements and workforce reductions commensurate with lower sales 
headcount was lower at the end of fiscal as compared to fiscal net company sponsored pension costs in fiscal were million higher than in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in discount rates used to calculate our projected benefit obligation and related pension expense at the end of fiscal  partially offset by reduced amortization of our net actuarial loss resulting from actuarial gains from higher returns on assets of sysco s retirement plan during fiscal net company sponsored pension costs in fiscal have been determined as of the fiscal year end measurement date and will decrease by approximately million from fiscal due primarily to higher returns on assets of sysco s retirement plan during fiscal net company sponsored pension costs were million higher in fiscal than in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to lower returns on assets of sysco s company sponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan during fiscal  partially offset by an increase in the discount rates used to calculate our projected benefit obligation and related pension expense for fiscal from time to time  we may voluntarily withdraw from multi employer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans 
we recorded provisions related to multi employer pension plans of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal see additional discussion of multi employer pension plans at liquidity and capital resources  other considerations  multi employer pension plans 
sysco s fuel costs increased by million in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to increased contracted and market diesel prices 
our fuel costs decreased by million in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to decreased contracted diesel prices 
sysco s costs per gallon increased in fiscal over fiscal  as compared to a decrease of in fiscal over fiscal sysco s activities to mitigate fuel costs include reducing miles driven by our trucks through improved routing techniques  improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges 
we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements with a goal of mitigating a portion of the volatility in fuel prices 
our fuel commitments will result in either additional fuel costs or avoided fuel costs based on the comparison of the prices on the fixed price contracts and market prices for the respective periods 
in fiscal  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes 
in fiscal  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated million of additional fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were higher than market prices for the contracted volumes for a portion of the fiscal year 
in fiscal  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated million of additional fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were higher than market prices for the contracted volumes 
as of july   we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately million through june these contracts will lock in the price of approximately to of our fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods at prices lower than the current market price for diesel for the first weeks of fiscal and near the current market price for diesel for the remainder of the fiscal year 
subsequent to july   we entered into forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately million for july and august assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal  fuel costs exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  are expected to increase by approximately million to million as compared to fiscal our estimate is based upon current  published quarterly market price projections for diesel  the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal and estimates of fuel consumption 
actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change  in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates 
we continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset potential increases in fuel expense  including the use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management 
based on our current projections  we anticipate that the increase in fuel surcharges will offset the majority of our projected fuel cost increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal 
table of contents gross project expenses related to our business transformation project  inclusive of pay related expense  increased by million in fiscal from fiscal and by million in fiscal from fiscal the increase in fiscal resulted from increased project spend including the initial stages of ramping up of our shared services center and a provision for severance resulting from the implementation of an involuntary severance plan 
the increase in fiscal resulted from only six months of activity being included in fiscal  as the business transformation project began in january provided the improvements needed in the underlying systems are obtained in the first half of fiscal  we anticipate the software will be ready for its intended use in the second half of fiscal  which will result in increased expense from both software amortization and deployment costs 
we will also incur increased costs from the ramp up of our shared services center  continuing costs for additional phases of our business transformation project and information technology support costs 
we believe the increase in gross project expenses  including all pay related expenses  related to the business transformation project in fiscal as compared to fiscal will be approximately million to million 
we adjust the carrying values of our coli policies to their cash surrender values on an ongoing basis 
the cash surrender values of these policies are largely based on the values of underlying investments  which through fiscal included publicly traded securities 
as a result  the cash surrender values of these policies fluctuated with changes in the market value of such securities 
the changes in the financial markets resulted in gains for these policies of million in fiscal  compared to gains for these policies of million in fiscal and losses of million in fiscal near the end of fiscal  we reallocated all of our policies into low risk  fixed income securities and therefore we no longer expect significant volatility in operating income  net earnings and earnings per share in future periods related to these policies 
the provision for losses on receivables included within operating expenses decreased by million in fiscal over fiscal the decrease in our provision for losses on receivables in fiscal reflects fewer customer accounts exceeding our threshold for write off in fiscal as compared to fiscal customer accounts written off  net of recoveries  were million  or of sales  million  or of sales  and million  or of sales  for fiscal  and  respectively 
our provision for losses on receivables will fluctuate with general market conditions  as well as the circumstances of our customers 
net earnings net earnings for fiscal decreased over the comparable prior year period 
after adjusting for the estimated impact of the rd week in fiscal  the decrease would have been 
this adjusted decrease was primarily due to the factors discussed above and an increase in the effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was  compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal the difference between the tax rates for the two periods resulted largely from the one time reversal of interest accruals for tax contingencies related to our settlement with the internal revenue service irs in the first quarter of fiscal net earnings increased in fiscal from fiscal after adjusting for the estimated impact of the rd week in fiscal  the increase would have been

partially offsetting these favorable impacts was the recording of million in tax and interest related to various federal  foreign and state uncertain tax positions

after adjusting for the estimated impact of the rd week in fiscal  earnings per share increased 
this adjusted increase was primarily the result of factors discussed above  as well as a net reduction in shares outstanding

segment results we have aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments  of which only broadline and sygma are reportable segments as defined in accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  the company s custom cut meat operations were reorganized to function as part of the united states broadline segment 
as a result  the results of the custom cut meat operations are included in the broadline reportable segment in the segment discussion below 
previously  these operations were an independent segment and were presented with the other financial information relating to non reportable segments 
segment reporting for the comparable prior year periods has been revised to conform to the new classification of the custom cut meat operations as part of the broadline reportable segment 
the accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by sysco within the financial statements and supplementary data within part ii item of this form k 
intersegment sales generally represent specialty produce products distributed by the broadline and sygma operating companies 
the segment results include certain centrally incurred costs for shared services that are charged to our segments 
these centrally incurred costs are charged based upon the relative level of service used by each operating company consistent with how management views the performance of its operating segments 
management evaluates the performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results  which include the allocation of certain centrally incurred costs 
while a segment s operating income may be impacted in the short term by increases or decreases in gross profits  expenses  or a combination thereof  over the long term each business segment is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth 
this is consistent with our long term goal of leveraging earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth 
included in corporate expenses  among other items  are gains and losses recognized to adjust coli policies to their cash surrender values  share based compensation expense  expenses related to the company s business transformation project  and corporate level depreciation and amortization expense

for purposes of this statistical table  operating income of our segments excludes corporate expenses of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal that are not charged to our segments 
this information should be read in conjunction with note  business segment information to the consolidated financial statements in item weeks segment segment segment operating operating operating sales income sales income sales income broadline sygma other intersegment sales total broadline segment the broadline reportable segment consists of the aggregated results of the united states  canadian and european broadline segments  as well as the custom cut meat operations 
broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non food products to customers 
broadline operations have significantly higher operating margins than the rest of sysco s operations 
in fiscal  the broadline operating results represented approximately of sysco s overall sales and of the aggregate operating income of sysco s segments  which excludes corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments 
there are several factors which contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the sygma and other operating segments 
we have invested substantial amounts in assets  operating methods  technology and management expertise in this segment 
the breadth of its sales force  geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power allow us to leverage this segment s earnings 
sales sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal negatively affecting the sales comparison of fiscal to fiscal was the additional week in fiscal product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices  combined with case volume improvement  contributed to the increase in sales in fiscal changes in product costs  an internal measure of inflation or deflation  were estimated as inflation of in fiscal non comparable acquisitions contributed to the overall sales comparison for fiscal the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively impacted sales by compared to fiscal sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal case volume improvement caused an increase in sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively impacted sales by compared to fiscal non comparable acquisitions contributed to the overall sales comparison for fiscal changes in product costs were estimated as deflation of in fiscal this product cost deflation  which led to decreases in selling prices  and a change in customer sales mix partially offset case volume improvement in fiscal the additional week also contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 
table of contents operating income operating income increased by in fiscal over fiscal as gross profit dollars increased slightly above the rate that operating expenses increased 
however  it is important to note that operating expenses included a significant charge of million from a withdrawal from a multi employer pension plan 
additionally  negatively affecting the operating income comparison of fiscal to fiscal was the additional week in fiscal gross profit dollars increased in fiscal primarily due to increased sales  however  gross profit dollars increased at a lower rate than sales 
this slower growth in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of two factors 
based on broadline s product sales mix for fiscal  it was most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the dairy  meat and seafood product categories in the range of to 
broadline s largest selling product category  canned and dry  experienced inflation of 
while we are generally able to pass through modest levels of inflation to our customers  we were unable pass through fully these higher levels of product cost inflation with the same gross profit percentage in these product categories without negatively impacting our customers business and therefore our business 
while we cannot predict whether inflation will continue at these levels  prolonged periods of high inflation  either overall or in certain product categories  can have a negative impact on our customers  as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the food away from home market  and may negatively impact the broadline segment s sales  gross profit and earnings 
second  ongoing strategic pricing initiatives largely lowered our prices to our customers in certain product categories in order to increase sales volumes 
these initiatives are being phased in over time and resulted in short term gross profit declines as a percentage of sales  but we believe will result in long term gross profit dollar growth due to higher sales volumes and increased market share 
we have experienced meaningful year over year volume growth with those items included in the early phases of these programs in the geographies where this program has been implemented 
we believe the long term benefits of these strategic initiatives will result in profitable market share growth 
in addition  gross profit dollars for fiscal increased as a result of higher fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges were approximately million higher in fiscal than the prior year due to the application of fuel surcharges to a broader customer base for a small portion of the third quarter and the entire fourth quarter due to higher fuel prices incurred during these periods 
assuming that fuel prices do not greatly rise above recent levels during fiscal  we expect fuel surcharges to largely offset our increased fuel costs expected in fiscal the expense increases in fiscal were driven largely by provisions for withdrawal from a multi employer pension plan and an increase in pay related expenses 
in fiscal  we recorded provisions of million for withdrawal liabilities from multi employer pension plans from which union members elected to withdraw 
the increase in pay related expenses related to the sales and gross profit increase  including both delivery personnel costs and sales 
portions of our pay related expense are variable in nature and are expected to increase when sales and gross profit increase 
pay related expenses from acquired companies and changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars also contributed to the increase 
fuel costs were million higher in fiscal than the prior year 
assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal  fuel costs for fiscal not including any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  are expected to increase by approximately million to million as compared to fiscal our estimate is based upon current  published quarterly market price projections for diesel  the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal and estimates of fuel consumption 
actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change  in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates 
we continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset potential increases in fuel expense  including the use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management 
operating income increased by in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to effective management of operations in the current economic environment by decreasing expenses as compared to the comparable prior year periods 
operating expenses decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the additional week in fiscal contributed to the gross profit increase  partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in the fuel surcharges charged to customers in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to less usage of these surcharges in fiscal expense performance for fiscal was primarily due to reduced fuel cost and lower provision for losses on receivables and operating efficiencies  such as reduced pay related expense due to reduced headcount 
fuel costs were million lower in fiscal than in the prior year 
partially offsetting these expense declines were increases in expenses related to the additional week in fiscal from time to time  we may voluntarily withdraw from multi employer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans 
we recorded provisions related to multi employer pension plans of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal sygma segment sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations 
sygma operations have traditionally had lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco s other segments 
this segment of the foodservice industry has generally been characterized by lower overall operating margins as the volume that these customers command allows them to negotiate for reduced margins 
these operations service chain restaurants through contractual agreements that are typically structured on a fee per case delivered basis 

table of contents sales sales were greater in fiscal than in fiscal negatively affecting the sales comparison of fiscal to fiscal was the additional week in fiscal the increase in sales was primarily due to case volume improvement largely attributable to new customers and  to a lesser extent  from an increase in volume from certain existing customers 
sales were greater in fiscal than in fiscal the additional week contributed to the sales growth in fiscal case volume improvement caused an increase in sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal this case growth was largely attributable to new customers added largely in the latter part of the fiscal year and the additional week in fiscal partially offsetting these case volume improvements was a decline in volume from existing customers due to the weak economic environment which applied continued pressure to consumer discretionary spending and negatively impacted overall restaurant traffic counts 
product cost deflation  which led to decreases in selling prices also impacted fiscal sales growth 
one chain restaurant customer the wendy s company accounted for approximately of the sygma segment sales for the fiscal year ended july  sygma maintains multiple regional contracts with varied expiration dates with this customer 
while the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sygma  we do not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole 
operating income operating income increased million in over the prior year due to increased sales and improved productivity 
gross profit dollars increased while operating expenses increased in fiscal from fiscal contributing to the gross profit increase in fiscal were increased sales and an increase of approximately million in the fuel surcharges charged to customers in fiscal from prior year due to higher fuel prices in fiscal the increase in operating expenses for fiscal was largely driven by increased delivery and warehouse personnel payroll costs resulting from increased sales as well as increased fuel cost 
productivity improvements occurred within our warehouse and delivery functions in fiscal and expense reductions occurred within our administrative functions in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
fuel costs in fiscal were million greater than the prior year 
assuming that fuel prices do not significantly rise above recent levels during fiscal  we expect fuel costs and fuel surcharges for our sygma segment to increase as compared to fiscal operating income increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross profit dollars increased while operating expenses decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the additional week in fiscal contributed to the gross profit increase  partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in the fuel surcharges charged to customers in fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower fuel prices in fiscal expense reductions were accomplished by operational efficiencies in both delivery and warehouse areas  as well as lower payroll expense related to headcount reductions 
also contributing to the decrease in operating expenses was a decrease of million in fuel costs in fiscal from the prior year due to lower fuel prices 
other segment other financial information is attributable to our other operating segments  including our specialty produce and lodging industry products and a company that distributes to international customers 
these operating segments are discussed on an aggregate basis as they do not represent reportable segments under segment accounting literature 
on an aggregate basis  our other segment has had a lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco s broadline segment 
sysco has acquired the operating companies within these segments in relatively recent years 
these operations generally operate in a niche within the foodservice industry 
each individual operation is also generally smaller in sales and scope than an average broadline operation and each of these operating segments is considerably smaller in sales and overall scope than the broadline segment 
in fiscal  in the aggregate  the other segment represented approximately of sysco s overall sales and of the aggregate operating income of sysco s segments  which excludes corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments 
operating income increased for fiscal from fiscal the operating income comparison was negatively affected by the additional week in fiscal the increase in operating income was caused primarily by increased sales in the specialty produce segment and favorable expense management in the specialty produce and lodging industry products segments 
operating income increased for fiscal from fiscal the increase in operating income was caused primarily by increased sales in our specialty produce segment and increased operating income in all segments due to favorable expense management 
the additional week in fiscal also contributed to the increase in operating income 
liquidity and capital resources sysco s strategic objectives require continuing investment and our financial resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets 
our operations historically have produced significant cash flow 
cash generated from operations is generally allocated to working capital requirements  investments in facilities  systems  fleet  other equipment and technology  acquisitions compatible with our overall growth strategy  and cash dividends 
any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in high quality  short term instruments or applied toward the cost of the share repurchase program 
as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis  we regularly evaluate 
table of contents business opportunities  including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses  and our overall capital structure 
any transactions resulting from these evaluations may materially impact our liquidity  borrowing capacity  leverage ratios and capital availability 
our liquidity and capital resources can be influenced by economic trends and conditions primarily due to their impact on our cash flows from operations 
weak economic conditions and low levels of consumer confidence and the resulting pressure on consumer disposable income can lower our sales growth and potentially our cash flows from operations 
while these factors were present in fiscal and fiscal  they had only a modest impact on our cash flows from operations in these periods due in large part to effective working capital management 
we do not believe current economic conditions will significantly impact our cash flows from operations in fiscal  as we can respond to reduced consumer demand  if it were to occur  by lowering our working capital requirements 
additionally  approximately one third of our customers are not impacted by general economic conditions to the same extent as restaurants and other food retailers 
these customers include hospitals  nursing homes  schools and colleges 
product cost inflation can potentially lower our gross profit and cash flow from operations if we are unable to pass through all of the increased product costs with the same gross profit percentage to our customers 
this occurred in fiscal  as we were able to pass some  but not all  of our product cost increases on to our customers 
however  we believe our mechanisms to manage product cost inflation  some of which are contractual  are sufficient to limit the impact on our cash flows from operations 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs and bank lines of credit and our ability to access capital from financial markets  including issuances of debt securities  either privately or under our shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission sec  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months and beyond  while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes 
we believe that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper market effectively as well as the long term capital markets  if necessary 
to further maintain and enhance our credit ratings on current and future debt  on january   the wholly owned us broadline subsidiaries of sysco corporation entered into full and unconditional guarantees of all outstanding senior notes and debentures of sysco corporation 
as of july   sysco had a total of approximately billion in senior notes and debentures outstanding that are covered by this guarantee 
operating activities we generated billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal  billion in fiscal and billion in fiscal the increase of million between fiscal and fiscal was driven largely by a reduction in the amount of payments made in relation to the irs settlement of million and reduced pension contributions in the amount of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal these increases were partially offset by changes in working capital discussed in more detail below 
the decrease of million between fiscal and fiscal was driven largely by million of payments related to the irs settlement and million of pension contributions made in advance for fiscal additionally  several less significant items had offsetting impacts when comparing the cash flow from operations between fiscal and fiscal as described under other considerations  bscc cooperative structure  we will make the final payments under the irs settlement in fiscal in the amount of million 
cash flow from operations in fiscal was primarily generated by net income  reduced by increases in receivables and inventory balances and changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities  partially offset by non cash depreciation and amortization expense and increases in accounts payable 
cash flow from operations in fiscal was primarily due to net income and non cash depreciation and amortization expense  offset by decreases in accrued income taxes and other long term liabilities and prepaid pension cost  net  increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances and changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
cash flow from operations in fiscal was primarily due to net income  non cash depreciation and amortization expense  an increase in accrued income taxes  and increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances 
the increases in fiscal were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable balances and accrued expenses 
the increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal and fiscal were primarily due to sales growth 
an increase in daily sales outstanding also contributed to the increase in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal the decrease in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal was primarily due to the sales decline 
the increase in accounts payable balances in fiscal and fiscal was primarily from the growth in inventory resulting from sales growth 
the decrease in accounts payable balances in fiscal was primarily from inventory decreases resulting from the sales decline 
accounts payable balances are impacted by many factors  including changes in product mix  cash discount terms and changes in payment terms with vendors 
cash flow from operations was impacted by a decrease in accrued expenses of million during fiscal  an increase in accrued expenses of million during fiscal and a decrease in accrued expenses of million during fiscal the decrease in accrued expenses in the fiscal was primarily due to the payment of the respective prior year annual incentive bonuses  partially offset by lower accruals for current year compensation incentives 
the remainder of the decrease was driven by multiple changes in various other accruals  of which no item was individually significant 
the increase in accrued expenses during fiscal was primarily due to increases in incentive compensation accruals resulting from improved operating performance in fiscal the remainder of the increase was driven by multiple changes in various other accruals  of which no item was individually significant 
the decrease in accrued expenses during fiscal was primarily due to the payment of prior year annual incentive bonuses  offset by lower accruals for current year incentive bonuses 
cash flow from operations for fiscal was negatively impacted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities of million and a decrease in accrued income taxes of million 
cash flow from operations for fiscal was negatively impacted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities of million and a decrease in accrued income taxes of million 
the main factor affecting both of these changes in fiscal and fiscal  as well as cash taxes paid  was the irs settlement discussed below in other considerations  bscc cooperative 
table of contents structure  which resulted in the payment of taxes of million in fiscal and million in fiscal for the settlement agreement 
partially offsetting the negative impact described above  the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities was impacted by the contribution of an additional million to our company sponsored qualified pension plan in fiscal for contributions that would normally have been made in fiscal cash flow from operations for fiscal was positively impacted by an increase in accrued income taxes of million  partially offset by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities of million 
total cash taxes paid were million   million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the changes in all periods were also impacted by the current tax provision and current year estimated tax payments 
other long term liabilities increased million during fiscal the increase for was primarily attributable to three items 
first  we recorded withdrawal liabilities from multi employer pension plans from which union members elected to withdraw during the period 
second  net company sponsored pension costs exceeded contributions to our company sponsored pension plans during the period 
third  we recognized a provision for severance resulting from the implementation of an involuntary severance plan 
partially offsetting these increases  our liability for uncertain tax positions decreased as a result of settlements with various taxing authorities during the period 
other long term liabilities and prepaid pension cost  net  decreased million during fiscal the decrease in fiscal is primarily attributable to three items 
first  pension contributions to our company sponsored plans exceeded net company sponsored pension costs 
second  our liability for deferred incentive compensation decreased due to accelerated distributions taken by plan participants of all or a portion of their vested balances pursuant to certain transitional relief under the provisions of section a of the internal revenue code and other regular distributions 
third  our liability for uncertain tax positions decreased as a result of the settlement with the irs  as well as a reclass to accrued income taxes for amounts expected to be paid in fiscal other long term liabilities and prepaid pension cost  net  decreased million during fiscal the decrease in fiscal is primarily attributable to a decrease in our liability for uncertain tax benefits related to our settlement with the irs 
see additional discussion of an irs settlement at other considerations  bscc cooperative structure 
the decrease was partially offset by a combination of the recording of net company sponsored pension costs and incentive compensation deferrals 
we recorded net company sponsored pension costs of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our contributions to our company sponsored defined benefit plans were million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
included in the million of contributions in fiscal was a million contribution to our retirement plan that would normally have been made in fiscal included in the million of contributions in fiscal was a million contribution to our retirement plan that would normally have been made in fiscal and quarterly contributions totaling million for fiscal additional contributions to our retirement plan are not currently anticipated in fiscal  however we will evaluate our funding position at the end of fiscal and select the timing for a contribution at that time 
investing activities fiscal capital expenditures included investments in technology including our business transformation project  fleet replacements  replacement or significant expansion of facilities in philadelphia  pennsylvania and central texas  the purchase of land for a fold out facility in southern california  and the remodeling of our shared services facility purchased in fiscal fiscal capital expenditures included investments in technology including our business transformation project  fleet replacements  replacement or significant expansion of facilities in vancouver  british columbia  canada  winnipeg  manitoba  canada  billings  montana  plainfield  new jersey  philadelphia  pennsylvania and houston  texas  the purchase of a facility for our future shared services operations in connection with our business transformation project  and the purchase of land for a fold out facility in long island  new york

table of contents we expect total capital expenditures in fiscal to be in the range of million to million 
fiscal expenditures will include facility  fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions  new facility construction  including fold out facilities  and investments in technology including our business transformation project 
during fiscal  in the aggregate  the company paid cash of million for operations acquired during fiscal and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years 
during fiscal  we acquired for cash broadline foodservice operations in central california  los angeles  california  ontario  canada  lincoln  nebraska  and trenton  new jersey

during fiscal  we acquired for cash broadline foodservice operations in ireland  los angeles  california and boston  massachusetts  as well as a produce distributor in toronto  ontario  canada 
financing activities equity proceeds from common stock reissued from treasury for share based compensation awards were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in proceeds in fiscal was due to an increase in the number of options exercised in fiscal  as compared to fiscal and the level of option exercises  and thus proceeds  will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price 
we traditionally have engaged in board approved share repurchase programs 
the number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years were  shares for million in fiscal   shares for million in fiscal and  shares for million in fiscal there were no additional shares repurchased through august   resulting in a remaining authorization by our board of directors to repurchase up to  shares  based on the trades made through that date 
our current share repurchase strategy is to purchase enough shares to keep our diluted average shares outstanding relatively constant 
based on forecasted and past share exercises pursuant to our option plans  we expect to repurchase slightly more shares in fiscal than in fiscal dividends paid were million  or per share  in fiscal  million  or per share  in fiscal and million  or per share  in fiscal in may  we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal of per share  which was paid in july in november  we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement covering  shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions 
as of august    shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement 
short term borrowings we have uncommitted bank lines of credit  which provided for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to million  of which none was outstanding as of july  or august  our irish subsidiary  pallas foods limited  has a million euro committed facility for unsecured borrowings for working capital 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of july  or august  on june   a canadian subsidiary of sysco entered into a short term demand loan facility for the purpose of facilitating a distribution from the canadian subsidiary to sysco  and sysco concurrently entered into an agreement with the bank to guarantee the loan 
the amount borrowed was million and was repaid in full on july  commercial paper and revolving credit facility we have a board approved commercial paper program allowing us to issue short term unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed billion 
sysco and one of our subsidiaries  sysco international  ulc  have a revolving credit facility supporting our us and canadian commercial paper programs 
the facility  in the amount of billion  expires on november   but is subject to extension 
during fiscal  and  aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances and short term bank borrowings ranged from approximately zero to million  zero to million  and zero to million  respectively 
there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding as of july  and million of commercial paper issuances outstanding as of august  during fiscal  and  our aggregate commercial paper issuances and short term bank borrowings had a weighted average interest rate of  and  respectively 

table of contents fixed rate debt included in current maturities of long term debt as july  are the senior notes totaling million  which mature in june these notes were issued by sysco international  co  a wholly owned subsidiary of sysco now known as sysco international  ulc 
it is our intention to fund the repayment of these notes at maturity through issuances of commercial paper  senior notes or a combination thereof 
in february  sysco deregistered the securities remaining unsold under its then existing shelf registration statement that was filed with the sec in february for the issuance of debt securities 
in february  sysco filed with the sec an automatically effective well known seasoned issuer shelf registration statement for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities that may be issued from time to time 
in march  sysco issued senior notes totaling million due march  the notes and senior notes totaling million due march  the notes under its february shelf registration 
the and notes  which were priced at and of par  respectively  are unsecured  are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows sysco to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by early redemption 
proceeds from the notes will be utilized over a period of time for general corporate purposes  which may include acquisitions  refinancing of debt  working capital  share repurchases and capital expenditures 
in september  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal to floating rate debt 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal to floating rate debt 
both transactions were entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost and increasing floating interest rate exposure 
these transactions were designated as fair value hedges since the swaps hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates 
total debt total debt as of july  was billion of which approximately was at fixed rates with a weighted average of and an average life of years  and the remainder was at floating rates with a weighted average of and an average life of one year 
certain loan agreements contain typical debt covenants to protect note holders  including provisions to maintain the company s long term debt to total capital ratio below a specified level 
sysco is currently in compliance will all debt covenants 
other as part of normal business activities  we issue letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements 
as of july  and july   letters of credit outstanding were million and million  respectively 
other considerations multi employer pension plans as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in item  we contribute to several multi employer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering union represented employees 
under current law regarding multi employer defined benefit plans  a plan s termination  our voluntary withdrawal or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multi employer defined benefit plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multi employer plan s unfunded vested liabilities 
generally  sysco does not have the greatest share of liability among the participants in any of the plans in which we participate 
based on the information available from plan administrators  which has valuation dates ranging from january  to december   we estimate our share of withdrawal liability on most of the multi employer plans in which we participate could have been as much as million as of july  based on a voluntary withdrawal 
this estimate excludes plans for which sysco has recorded withdrawal liabilities 
the majority of the plans we participate in have a valuation date of calendar year end 
as such  the majority of our estimated withdrawal liability results from plans for which the valuation date was december   therefore  our estimated liability reflects the asset losses incurred by the financial markets as of that date 
due to the lack of current information  we believe our current share of the withdrawal liability could materially differ from this estimate 
in addition  if a multi employer defined benefit plan fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements  the irs may impose a non deductible excise tax of on the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency for those employers contributing to the fund 
from time to time  we may voluntarily withdraw from multi employer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the union members of one of our subsidiaries voted to withdraw from the union s multi employer pension plan and join sysco s company sponsored retirement plan 
this action triggered a partial withdrawal from the multi employer pension plan 
as a result  during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a withdrawal liability provision of approximately million related to this plan 
we have experienced other instances triggering voluntary withdrawal from multi employer pension plans 
total withdrawal liability provisions recorded include million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal as of july   we had approximately million in liabilities recorded related to certain multi employer defined benefit plans for which our voluntary withdrawal had already occurred  which includes the liability recorded in the third quarter of fiscal recorded withdrawal liabilities are estimated at the time of withdrawal based on 
table of contents the most recently available valuation and participant data for the respective plans  amounts are adjusted up to the period of payment to reflect any changes to these estimates 
if any of these plans were to undergo a mass withdrawal  as defined by the pension benefit guaranty corporation  within a two year time frame from the point of our withdrawal  we could have additional liability 
we do not currently believe any mass withdrawals are probable to occur in the applicable two year time frame relating to the plans from which we have voluntarily withdrawn 
required contributions to multi employer plans could increase in the future as these plans strive to improve their funding levels 
in addition  the pension protection act  enacted in august  requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding 
we believe that any unforeseen requirements to pay such increased contributions  withdrawal liability and excise taxes would be funded through cash flow from operations  borrowing capacity or a combination of these items 
during fiscal  we obtained information that a multi employer pension plan we participated in failed to satisfy minimum funding requirements for certain periods and concluded that it was probable that additional funding would be required as well as the payment of excise tax 
as a result  during fiscal  we recorded a liability of approximately million related to our share of the minimum funding requirements and related excise tax for these periods 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we effectively withdrew from this multi employer pension plan in an effort to secure benefits for our employees that were participants in the plan and to manage our exposure to this under funded plan 
we agreed to pay million to the plan  which included the minimum funding requirements 
in connection with this withdrawal agreement  we merged active participants from this plan into sysco s company sponsored retirement plan and assumed million in liabilities 
the payment to the plan was made in the early part of the second quarter of fiscal bscc cooperative structure sysco s affiliate  baugh supply chain cooperative bscc  was a cooperative taxed under subchapter t of the united states internal revenue code  the operation of which had resulted in a deferral of tax payments 
the irs  in connection with its audits of our through federal income tax returns  proposed adjustments that would have accelerated amounts that we had previously deferred and would have resulted in the payment of interest on those deferred amounts 
sysco reached a settlement with the irs in the first quarter of fiscal to cease paying us federal taxes related to bscc on a deferred basis  pay the amounts that were recorded within deferred taxes related to bscc over a three year period and make a one time payment of million  of which approximately million was non deductible 
the settlement addressed the bscc deferred tax issue as it relates to the irs audit of our through federal income tax returns  and settles the matter for all subsequent periods  including the and federal income tax returns already under audit 
as a result of the settlement  we agreed to pay the amounts owed in the following schedule in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal as noted in the table above  payments related to the settlement were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
remaining amounts to be paid in will be paid in connection with our quarterly tax payments  two of which fall in the second quarter  one in the third quarter and one in the fourth quarter 
we believe we have access to sufficient cash on hand  cash flows from operations and current access to capital to make payments required in fiscal off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of july   certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments payments due by period more than total year years years years in thousands recorded contractual obligations short term bank borrowings long term debt capital lease obligations deferred compensation serp and other postretirement plans multi employer pension plans unrecognized tax benefits and interest irs deferred tax settlement unrecorded contractual obligations interest payments related to commercial paper and debt retirement plan long term non capitalized leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the estimate of the timing of future payments under the executive deferred compensation plan involves the use of certain assumptions  including retirement ages and payout periods 
includes estimated contributions to the unfunded serp and other postretirement benefit plans made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for vested participants in these plans through fiscal  based on actuarial assumptions 
represents voluntary withdrawal liabilities recorded and excludes normal contributions required under our collective bargaining agreements 
unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under accounting standards related to uncertain tax positions 
as of july   we had a liability of million for unrecognized tax benefits for all tax jurisdictions and million for related interest that could result in cash payment 
sysco reached a settlement with the irs in the first quarter of fiscal related to timing of tax payments 
apart from this item  we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of non current payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time 
accordingly  the related non current balances have not been reflected in the payments due by period section of the table 
includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of july   assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity  and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates 
the impact of our outstanding fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the fixed rate debt interest payments is included as well based on the floating rates in effect as of july  provides the estimated minimum contribution to the retirement plan through fiscal to meet erisa minimum funding requirements under the assumption that we only make minimum funding requirement contributions each year  based on actuarial assumptions 
for purposes of this table  purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business  for which all significant terms have been confirmed  including minimum quantities resulting from our sourcing initiative 
such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates 
purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with a third party to provide hardware and hardware hosting services over a ten year period ending in fiscal see discussion under note  commitments and contingencies  to the notes to consolidated financial statements in item  fixed electricity agreements and fixed fuel purchase commitments 
purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required 
certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration  typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved 
aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of july  included million 
this amount is not included in the table above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements 
significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the allowance for 
table of contents doubtful accounts receivable  self insurance programs  company sponsored pension plans  income taxes  vendor consideration  goodwill and intangible assets and share based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
we utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off  including whether a customer has filed for or has been placed in bankruptcy  has had accounts referred to outside parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods 
allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write offs and recoveries 
in addition  in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected 
our judgment is required as to the impact of certain of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of our accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  as was the case in fiscal  additional allowances may be required 
self insurance program we maintain a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation  general liability and vehicle liability costs 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers 
we also maintain a fully self insured group medical program 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  medical cost trends  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims  safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 
company sponsored pension plans amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits  the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
for guidance in determining the discount rates  we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan 
the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the retirement plan  which was determined as of the july  measurement date  decreased basis points to 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the serp  which was determined as of the july  measurement date  decreased basis points to 
the combined effect of these discount rate changes increased our net company sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal by an estimated million 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the retirement plan  which was determined as of the july  measurement date  decreased basis points to 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the serp  which was determined as of the july  measurement date  decreased basis points to 
the combined effect of these discount rate changes will increase our net company sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal by an estimated million 
a basis point increase in the discount rates for fiscal would decrease sysco s net company sponsored pension cost by million  while a basis point decrease in the discount rates would increase pension cost by million 
the impact of a basis point increase in the discount rates differs from the impact of a basis point decrease in discount rates because the liabilities are less sensitive to change at higher discount rates 
therefore  a basis point increase in the discount rate will not generate the same magnitude of change as a basis point decrease in the discount rate 
we look to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels 
we used a plan specific age related set of rates for the retirement plan  which are equivalent to a single rate of as of july  and july  for determining the benefit obligations as of july  and july   the serp calculations use an age graded salary growth assumption 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan was for fiscal and fiscal the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns  reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds  historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments 
although not determinative of future returns  the effective annual rate of return on plan assets  developed using geometric compound averaging  was approximately    and  over the year  year  year and year periods ended december   respectively 
in addition  in nine of the last years  the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 
the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 
the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan is for fiscal a basis point increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal would decrease increase sysco s net company sponsored pension costs for fiscal by approximately million 

table of contents pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of july  was a charge  net of tax  of million 
the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of july  was a charge  net of tax  of million 
changes in the assumptions  including changes to the discount rate discussed above  together with the normal growth of the plans  the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions  increased net company sponsored pension costs by approximately million in fiscal changes in the assumptions  including changes to the discount rate discussed above  together with the normal growth of the plans  the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods  the impact of plan amendments and the timing and amount of contributions are expected to decrease net company sponsored pension costs in fiscal by approximately million 
we made cash contributions to our company sponsored pension plans of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
included in the million of contributions in fiscal was a million contribution to our retirement plan that would normally have been made in fiscal we did not have a minimum required contribution to the retirement plan for the calendar plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirements 
included in the million of contributions in fiscal the minimum required contribution for the calendar plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirements  as well as a million contribution to our retirement plan that would normally have been made in fiscal we do not have a minimum required contribution to the retirement plan for the calendar plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirements that must be made in fiscal additional contributions to our retirement plan are not currently anticipated in fiscal  however we will evaluate our funding position at the end of fiscal and select the timing for a contribution at that time 
the estimated fiscal contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp plan are approximately million 
income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state  as well as foreign jurisdictions 
jurisdictional tax law changes  increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items  accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances  and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 
we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  however  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established  or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities  our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
vendor consideration we recognize consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by sysco 
there are several types of cash consideration received from vendors 
in many instances  the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound 
in these instances  we will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold 
in some instances  vendor consideration is received upon receipt of inventory in our distribution facilities 
we estimate the amount needed to reduce our inventory based on inventory turns until the product is sold 
our inventory turnover is usually less than one month  therefore  amounts deferred against inventory do not require long term estimation 
in the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases  we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete  the related service is performed and the amounts realized 
historically  adjustments to our estimates related to vendor consideration have not been significant 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired  including goodwill and other intangible assets  as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 
in addition  annually in our fourth quarter or more frequently as needed  we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets 
the reporting units used in assessing goodwill impairment are our eight operating segments as described in note  business segment information  to the consolidated financial statements in item the components within each of our eight operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into eight reporting units 

table of contents we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings multiple models 
the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each of our eight operating segments 
we use a weighting for our discounted cash flow valuation and for the earnings multiple models giving greater emphasis to our discounted cash flow model because the forecasted operating results that serve as a basis for the analysis incorporate management s outlook and anticipated changes for the businesses 
the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums  earnings multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past  future cash flow estimates of the reporting units  which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates  and weighted average cost of capital  along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
when possible  we use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units 
we update our projections used in our discounted cash flow model based on historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 
our estimates of fair value contain uncertainties requiring management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections  resulting in the company revising its assumptions and  if required  recognizing an impairment loss 
there were no impairments of goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles recorded as a result of assessment in fiscal  and our past estimates of fair value for fiscal and have not been materially different when revised to include subsequent years actual results 
sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units 
in the fiscal analysis our estimates of fair value did not require additional analysis  however  we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for the following reporting units if our estimates of fair value were decreased by the following amounts 
first  our reporting unit that distributes to international customers would have required additional analysis if the estimated fair value had been lower 
second  our european broadline company would have required additional analysis if the estimated fair value had been lower 
third  our lodging industry products reporting unit would have required additional analysis if the estimated fair value had been lower 
lastly  our specialty produce operations would have required additional analysis if the estimated fair value had been lower 
at july   these four reporting units had goodwill aggregating million 
for the remainder of our reporting units which at july  had goodwill aggregating billion  we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for a reporting unit if the estimated fair value for any of these reporting units had declined by greater than 
certain reporting units european broadline  specialty produce  custom cut meat  lodging industry products and international distribution operations have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the united states broadline  canadian broadline or sygma reporting units 
this is primarily due to these businesses having been recently acquired  and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the united states broadline  canadian broadline and sygma reporting units 
in addition  these businesses also have lower levels of cash flow than the united states broadline reporting units 
as such  these reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn 
share based compensation we provide compensation benefits to employees and non employee directors under several share based payment arrangements including various employee stock incentive plans  the employees stock purchase plan  the management incentive plan and various non employee director plans 
as of july   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share based compensation arrangements 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco s stock  implied volatilities from traded options on sysco s stock and other factors 
we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model  separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the fair value of each restricted stock unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company s stock price as of the date of grant 
for restricted stock units granted without dividend equivalents  the fair value is reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period 
the fair value of the stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price 
the fair value of restricted stock granted to employees is based on the stock price on grant date 
the application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a post vesting restriction 
the compensation cost related to these share based awards is recognized over the requisite service period 
the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the compensation cost related to stock 
table of contents issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the employees stock purchase plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 
certain of our option awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period 
in those cases  we will recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
in other cases  certain of our option awards provide for graded vesting over a service period but include a performance based provision allowing for the vesting to accelerate 
in these cases  if it is probable that the performance condition will be met  we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the shorter performance period  otherwise  we recognize compensation cost over the probable longer service period 
in addition  certain of our share based awards provide that if the award holder retires at certain age and years of service thresholds  the options continue to vest as if the award holder continued to be an employee or director 
in these cases  for awards granted prior to july  our adoption date for the fair value recognition provisions in current stock compensation accounting standards  we will recognize the compensation cost for such awards over the remaining service period and accelerate any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when the employee retires 
for awards granted subsequent to july   we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the date of grant to the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire with his options continuing to vest after retirement 
our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes 
in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded  a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options 
we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option 
in such cases  we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate 
forward looking statements certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of they include statements about sysco s ability to increase its sales and market share and grow earnings  the continuing impact of economic conditions on consumer confidence and our business  sales and expense trends  including expectations regarding pay related expense and pension costs  anticipated multi employer pension related liabilities and contributions to various multi employer pension plans  expectations regarding potential payments of unrecognized tax benefits and interest  expectations regarding share repurchases  expected trends in fuel pricing  usage costs and surcharges  our expectation regarding the provision for losses on accounts receivable  expected implementation  costs and benefits of the erp system  estimated expenses and capital expenditures related to our business transformation project in fiscal  our plan to continue to explore and identify opportunities to grow in international markets and adjacent areas that complement our core business  the impact of ongoing legal proceedings  the loss of sygma s largest customer not having a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole  compliance with laws and government regulations not having a material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position  anticipated acquisitions and capital expenditures and the sources of financing for them  continued competitive advantages and positive results from strategic initiatives  anticipated company sponsored pension plan liabilities  our expectations regarding cash flow from operations  the availability and adequacy of insurance to cover liabilities  the impact of future adoption of accounting pronouncements  predictions regarding the impact of changes in estimates used in impairment analyses  the anticipated impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sysco s ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable 
these statements are based on management s current expectations and estimates  actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed at item a above and elsewhere 
in addition  the success of sysco s strategic initiatives could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses  including fuel costs 
expected trends related to fuel costs and usage are impacted by fluctuations in the economy generally and numerous factors affecting the oil industry that are beyond our control 
our efforts to lower our cost of goods sold may be impacted by factors beyond our control  including actions by our competitors and or customers 
we have experienced delays in the implementation of our business transformation project and the expected costs of our business transformation project may be greater or less than currently expected  as we may encounter the need for changes in design or revisions of the project calendar and budget 
our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience operating problems  scheduling delays  cost overages  or limitations on the extent of the business transformation during the erp implementation process 
as implementation of the erp system and the business transformation project begins  there may be changes in design or timing that impact near term expense and cause us to revise the project calendar and budget  and additional hiring and training of employees and consultants may be required  which could also impact project expense and timing 
company sponsored pension plan liabilities are impacted by a number of factors including the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits  the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
the amount of shares repurchased in a given period is subject to a number of factors  including available cash and our general working capital needs at the time 
our plans with respect to growth in international markets and adjacent areas that complement our core business are subject to the company s other strategic initiatives and plans and economic conditions generally 
legal proceedings are impacted by events  circumstances and individuals beyond the control of sysco 
the need for additional borrowing or other capital is impacted by factors that include capital expenditures or acquisitions in excess of those currently anticipated  stock repurchases at historical levels  or other unexpected cash requirements 
predictions regarding the future adoption of accounting pronouncements involve estimates without the benefit of precedent  and if our estimates turn out to be materially incorrect  our assessment of the impact of the pronouncement could prove incorrect  as well 
the anticipated impact of compliance with laws and regulations also involves the risk that estimates may turn out to be materially incorrect  and laws and regulations  as well as methods of enforcement  are subject to change 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes 
our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk 
floating rate debt  where the interest rate fluctuates periodically  exposes us to short term changes in market interest rates 
fixed rate debt  where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument  exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 
we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position 
the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments  potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 
fiscal as of july   we had no commercial paper outstanding 
total debt as of july  was billion  of which approximately was at fixed rates of interest  including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 
in fiscal  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal the fiscal swap and million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal the fiscal swap to floating rate debt 
both transactions were entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost 
these transactions were designated as fair value hedges since the swaps hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates 
as of july   the fiscal swap was recognized as an asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within other assets of million 
the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is and the floating interest rate on the swap is three month libor which resets quarterly

to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiary s functional currency  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into us dollars 
our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars 
the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively impacted sales by in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal the impact to our operating income  net earnings and earnings per share was not material in fiscal and fiscal a unfavorable change in the fiscal weighted year to date exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively impacted fiscal sales by and would not have materially impacted our operating income  net earnings and earnings per share 
we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks 
our canadian financing subsidiary has the us dollar as its functional currency and has notes denominated in us dollars 
we have the potential to create taxable income in canada when this debt is paid due to changes in the exchange rate from the inception of the debt through the payment date 
a unfavorable change in the fiscal year end exchange rate and the resulting increase in the tax liability associated with these notes would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
fuel price risk due to the nature of our distribution business  we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices 
the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production  seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control 
increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas 
first  the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food away from home purchases 
second  the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers 
third  increased 
table of contents fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers 
during fiscal  and  fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately  and of sales  respectively 
fuel costs  excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  incurred by sysco increased by approximately million in fiscal from fiscal and decreased by million in fiscal over fiscal we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements 
as of july   we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately million through june these contracts will lock in the price of approximately to of our fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods at prices lower than the current market price for diesel for the first weeks of fiscal and near the current market price for diesel for the remainder of the fiscal year 
fuel costs in fiscal  exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  are expected to increase by approximately million to million as compared to fiscal our estimate is based upon current  published quarterly market price projections for diesel  the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal and estimates of fuel consumption 
actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change  in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates 
a unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price used in our estimates above would change the range of potential increase to million to million 
investment risk our company sponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities 
the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon  among other things  the return on the plan s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan s liability 
fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and pension expense to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal year end  which is when this plan s funded status is measured 
also  the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets 
specifically  decreases in these interest rates may have a material impact on our results of operations 
to the extent the financial markets experience declines  our anticipated future contributions  pension expense and funded status will be affected for future years 
a unfavorable change in the value of the investments held by our company sponsored retirement plan at the plan s fiscal year end december  would not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal  however  this unfavorable change would increase our pension expense for fiscal by million and would reduce our shareholders equity on our balance sheet as of july  by million
