results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods presented  certain statement of operations data in thousands of us years ended april  april  sales cost of products sold gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss interest expense other expense income  net net income loss before taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss net income loss per share basic net income loss per share diluted sales for the fiscal year ended april  were approximately  an increase of  or  from  for fiscal proprietary products 
sales of our proprietary products and services were  for fiscal  which was a  or  increase from sales of  in the prior fiscal year 
sales of our wireless remote monitoring and industrial communication solutions were approximately  for the year ended april   which was an increase of roughly  or  from  for the year ended april  the increase in overall sales of remote monitoring equipment and services was the result of increases in customer orders received and shipped as well as an increase in our recurring licensing and data management services 
additionally  sales of sensorcast products and the director series of communication products and database services have totaled about  for the current fiscal year 
license and network services revenue also increased about  or  for the year ended april  as compared to the previous fiscal year as a result of the continued addition of units into the field 
we expect that sales of our wireless remote monitoring and telemetry solutions will continue to increase over the next few quarters due to continued strong demand for watchdogcp  sensorcast  director communication products and services  as well as the potential impact of new product releases including our recently announced zoneguard  a scada cyber security product 
sales of our radix rugged handheld computer hardware  peripherals and related services  including maintenance contract revenues and our extremetag rfid solutions  were approximately  for the year ended april  total sales were relatively flat as compared to the previous fiscal year reported revenues of approximately  sales during the year were made up of an increase in handheld computer sales of approximately  flat maintenance revenues year over year  and slightly offsetting decreases in software sales and installation services

we expect the fw  our latest product enhancements  related peripherals  and maintenance contract revenues  will increase slightly over the next few quarters as compared to the most recently completed quarters in fiscal our extremetag rfid tags and solutions could produce increases in sales over the next few quarters as a result of ongoing marketing efforts and anticipated future orders 
edms 
sales for the edms business segment were approximately  an increase of  or  from  in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in edms sales was a result of steady increases in bookings and shipments over the past fiscal year as our customers began to recover from the economic recession 
based on recent levels of edms bookings and feedback from existing customers  we anticipate that sales will likely hold steady or grow slightly in the near term as compared to sales levels over the last few fiscal quarters 
this estimate is based upon the planned addition of several new customers from on going business development efforts  the transition of several projects from our design group into production  anticipated additional orders from our existing customers  and current scheduled orders in backlog 
it should be noted that certain events could adversely affect sales over the next few quarters including  but not limited to  the impact of uncertain economic conditions  potential electronic raw material shortages stemming from supply chain disruptions  and inflationary price pressure on materials and energy 
these or similar events may affect current scheduled orders as well as future bookings and  in turn  adversely influence sales over the next few fiscal quarters

edms orders typically specify several deliveries scheduled over a defined period of time 
orders for our proprietary products are usually completed and shipped to the customer soon after the order is received 
certain larger proprietary product orders have specific deliveries scheduled through december or may not yet be scheduled for delivery due to uncertain field installation and deployment schedules and similar related factors 
these product orders  with future or unscheduled delivery dates  are included in the calculation of consolidated backlog

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we cannot ensure that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue from the manufacture of production units of electronic assemblies  liquid crystal displays  and our proprietary products including our remote monitoring equipment  rfid technology and solutions and our mobile computing products 
we also derive revenue from repairs and non warranty services  engineering design services  remote monitoring services and maintenance contracts 
production and repaired units are billed to the customer after they are shipped 
remote monitoring services and maintenance contracts are billed and the revenue recognized at the end of the month the services or maintenance periods are completed 
for customers that utilize our engineering design services  we bill the customer and recognize revenue after the design services or tooling have been completed 
we require our customers to provide a binding purchase order to verify the manufacturing services to be provided and to ensure payment 
typically  we do not have any post shipment obligations that would include customer acceptance requirements 
we do provide training and installation services to our customers and those services are billed and the revenue recognized at the end of the month the services are completed 
revenue recognized is net of sales taxes  tariffs  or duties remitted to any governmental authority 
inventory valuation 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out fifo method  or fair value 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  short term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand  as well as other market considerations 
we make provisions for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on our quarterly reviews of inventory quantities on hand and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers 
we review our inventory in detail on a quarterly basis utilizing multiple annual time horizons ranging from months to months 
individual part numbers that have not been used within each of the time horizons are examined by manufacturing personnel for obsolescence  excess and fair value 
parts that are not identified for common use or are unique to a former customer or application are categorized as obsolete and are discarded as part of our quarterly inventory write down 
if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer s financial condition and credit history  and current economic conditions 
receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded when received 
the majority of the customer accounts are considered past due after the invoice becomes older than the customer s credit terms days for the majority of customers 
interest is not charged on past due accounts for the majority of our customers 
warranty reserve 
we have established a warranty reserve for rework  product warranties and customer refunds 
we provide a limited warranty for a period of one year from the date of receipt of our products by our customers and we do offer extended warranties for additional purchase by our customers 
our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective products at no cost to the customer or refund the customer s purchase price 
the warranty reserve is based on historical experience and analysis of specific known and potential warranty issues 
the product warranty liability reflects management s best estimate of probable liability under our product warranties 
goodwill 
goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
we do not amortize goodwill  but rather review our carrying value for impairment annually january  and whenever an impairment indicator is identified 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step approach 
the first step is to identify if potential impairment of goodwill exists 
if impairment of goodwill is determined to exist  the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of the impairment using a fair value based approach 
intangible assets 
intangible assets consist of patents  trademarks  copyrights  customer relationships  and capitalized software 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
the useful lives of the intangible assets range from years 
impairment of long lived intangible assets 
long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be fully recoverable 
these events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration of operating results  changes in business plans  or changes in anticipated future cash flows 
if an impairment indicator is present  we evaluate recoverability by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount  we would recognize an impairment loss 
an impairment loss would be measured by comparing the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived assets and intangibles

eitf  effective for years beginning after june  vendors often provide multiple products and or services to their customers as part of a single arrangement

the existing guidance regarding how and whether to separate these deliverables and how to allocate the overall arrangement consideration to each was originally captured in eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which is now codified at asc topic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
the issuance of asu amends asc topic and represents a significant shift from the existing guidance that was considered abuse preventative and heavily geared toward ensuring that revenue recognition was not accelerated 
the application of this new guidance is expected to result in accounting for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements that better reflects their economics as more arrangements will be separated into individual units of accounting 
the adoption of asu no

in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income  effective for interim periods and years beginning after december  the issuance of asu is intended to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
the guidance in asu supersedes the presentation options in asc topic and facilitates convergence of us generally accepted accounting principles and international financial reporting standards by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requiring that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements
