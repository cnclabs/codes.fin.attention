in  oc bvi completed the construction of a  us gallons per day plant at bar bay  tortola  in the british virgin islands 
this plant began supplying water to the bvi government in january the definitive contract for the sale of water from this plant was signed on march  the contract has a term of seven years with a seven year renewal option exercisable by the bvi government 
oc bvi s plant on the island of jost van dyke was expanded in and has a capacity of  us gallons per day 
this plant operates under a contract with the bvi government that expires july  reverse osmosis technology the conversion of seawater to potable water is called desalination 
the two primary forms of desalination are distillation and reverse osmosis 
both methods are used throughout the world and technologies are improving to lower the costs of production 
reverse osmosis is a fluid separation process in which the saline water is pressurized and the fresh water is separated from the saline water by passing through a semi permeable membrane which rejects the salts 
the saline or seawater water is first passed through a pretreatment system  which generally consists of fine filtration and the addition of treatment chemicals if required 
pre treatment removes suspended solids and organics which could cause fouling of the membrane surface 
next  a high pressure pump pressurizes the saline water thus enabling a conversion of the saline water to fresh water as it passes through the membrane  while more than of the dissolved salts are rejected and remain the concentrated saline water 
this remaining feed water which has now been concentrated is discharged without passing through the membrane 
the remaining hydraulic energy in the concentrated feed water is transferred to the initial saline feed water with an energy recovery device thus reducing the total energy requirement for the reverse osmosis system 
the final step is post treatment  which consists of stabilizing the produced fresh water  thereby removing undesirable dissolved gases  adjusting the ph and providing chlorination to prepare it for distribution 
we use reverse osmosis technology to convert seawater to potable water at all of the plants we construct and operate 
we believe that this technology is the most effective and efficient conversion process for our market 
however  we are always seeking ways to maximize efficiencies in our current processes and investigating new  more efficient processes to convert seawater to potable water 
the equipment at our plants is among the most energy efficient available and we monitor and maintain the equipment in an efficient manner 
as a result of our decades of experience in seawater desalination  we believe that we have an expertise in the development and operation of desalination plants which is easily transferable to locations outside of our current operating areas 
raw materials and sources of supply all materials  parts and supplies essential to our business operations are obtained from multiple sources and we use the latest industry technology 
we do not manufacture any parts or components for equipment essential to our business 
our access to seawater for processing into potable water is granted through our licenses and contracts with governments of the various jurisdictions in which we have our operations 
seasonal variations in our business our operations are affected by the levels of tourism and are subject to seasonal variations in our service areas 
demand for our water in the cayman islands  belize  bimini and the bahamas is affected by variations in the level of tourism and local weather  primarily rainfall 
tourism in our service areas is affected by the economies of the tourists home countries  primarily the united states and europe  terrorist activity and perceived threats thereof  and increased costs of fuel and airfares 
we normally sell more water during the first and second quarters  when the number of tourists is greater and local rainfall is less  than in the third and fourth quarters 
government regulations  custom duties and taxes our operations and activities are subject to the governmental regulations and taxes of the countries in which we operate 
the following summary of regulatory developments and legislation does not purport to describe all present and proposed regulation and legislation that may affect our businesses 
legislative or regulatory requirements currently applicable to our businesses may change in the future 
any such changes could impose new obligations on us that may adversely affect our businesses and operating results 
the cayman islands the cayman islands are a british overseas territory and have had a stable political climate since  when the treaty of madrid ceded the cayman islands to england 
the queen of england appoints the governor of the cayman islands to make laws with the advice and consent of the legislative assembly 
there are elected members of the legislative assembly and three members appointed by the governor from the civil service 
the cabinet is responsible for day to day government operations 
the cabinet consists of five ministers who are chosen by the legislative assembly from its popularly elected members  and the three civil service members 
the elected members choose from among themselves  a leader who is designated the premier and is in effect the leader of the elected government 
the governor has reserved powers and the united kingdom retains full control over foreign affairs and defense 
the cayman islands are a common law jurisdiction and have adopted a legal system similar to that of the united kingdom 
the cayman islands have no taxes on profits  income  distributions  capital gains or appreciation 
we have exemptions from  or receive concessionaire rates of customs duties on capital expenditures for plant and major consumable spare parts and supplies imported into the cayman islands as follows we do not pay import duty or taxes on reverse osmosis membranes  electric pumps and motors and chemicals  but we do pay duty at the rate of of the cost  including insurance and transportation to the cayman islands  of other plant and associated materials and equipment to manufacture or supply water in the seven mile beach or west bay areas 
we have been advised by the government of the cayman islands that we will not receive any duty concessions in our new retail water license  and oc cayman pays full customs duties in respect of all plants that it operates for the water authority cayman 
the stamp tax on the transfer of ownership of land in the cayman islands is a major source of revenue to the cayman islands government 
to prevent stamp tax avoidance by transfer of ownership of the shares of a company which owns land in the cayman islands as opposed to transfer of the land itself  the land holding companies share transfer tax law was passed in the effect of this law is to charge a company  which owns land or an interest in land in the cayman islands  a tax based on the value of its land or interest in land attributable to each share transferred 
the stamp tax calculation does not take into account the proportion which the value of a company s cayman land or interest in land bears to its total assets and whether the intention of the transfer is to transfer ownership of part of a company s entire business or a part of its cayman land or interest in land 
prior to our common shares becoming publicly traded in the united states  we paid this tax on private share transfers 
we have never paid the tax on transfers of our publicly traded shares and requested an exemption in on april   we received notice that the cayman islands government had granted an exemption from taxation for all transfers of our shares 
we believe it is unlikely that government will seek to collect this tax on transfers of our publicly traded shares during through april  the bahamas the commonwealth of the bahamas is an independent nation and a constitutional parliamentary democracy with the queen of england as the constitutional head of state 
the basis of the bahamian law and legal system is the english common law tradition with a supreme court  court of appeals  and a magistrates court 
we have not been granted any tax exemptions for our bahamian operations 
bahamian companies are subject to an annual business license fee ranging from to of their gross revenues 
belize belize formerly british honduras achieved full independence from the united kingdom in today  belize is a constitutional monarchy with the adoption of a constitution in based on the british model with three independent branches  the queen of england is the constitutional head of state  represented by a governor general in the government 
a prime minister and cabinet make up the executive branch  while a member elected house of representatives and a nine member appointed senate form a bicameral legislature 
the cabinet consists of a prime minister  other ministers and ministers of state who are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister  who has the support of the majority party in the house of representatives 
belize is an english common law jurisdiction with a supreme court  court of appeals and local magistrate courts 
the government of belize has exempted cw belize from certain customs duties and all revenue replacement duties until april   and had exempted cw belize from company taxes until january  belize levies a gross receipts tax on corporations at a rate varying between and  depending on the type of business  and a corporate income tax at a rate of of chargeable income 
gross receipts tax payable amounts are credited towards corporate income tax 
the government of belize also implemented certain environmental taxes and a general sales tax effective july  and increased certain business and personal taxes and created new taxes effective march  belize levies import duty on most imported items at rates varying between and  with most items attracting a rate of 
in  it was determined that the tax exemption was no longer valid and cw belize paid approximately  of business and corporate income tax for the period through under the terms of our water supply agreement with bwsl we are reimbursed by bwsl for all taxes and customs duties that we are required to pay and have recorded this reimbursement as an offset to our tax expense

since  the bvi has held responsibility for its own internal affairs 
the bvi constitution provides for the people of the bvi to be represented by a ministerial system of government  led by an elected premier  a cabinet of ministers and the house of assembly 
the house of assembly comprises elected representatives  the attorney general  and the speaker 
the judicial system  based on english law  is under the direction of the eastern caribbean supreme court  which includes the high court of justice and the court of appeal 
the ultimate appellate court is the privy council in london 
market and service area although we currently operate in the cayman islands  belize  the british virgin islands  the bahamas and bermuda  we believe that our potential market consists of any location where there is a need for potable water 
the desalination of seawater  either through distillation or reverse osmosis  is the most widely used process for producing fresh water in areas with an insufficient natural supply 
we believe our experience in the development and operation of distillation and reverse osmosis desalination plants provides us with a significant opportunity to successfully expand our operations beyond the markets in which we currently operate 
prior to our acquisition of oc cayman in february  the market that we serviced under our exclusive license in the cayman islands consisted of seven mile beach and west bay  grand cayman  two of the three most populated areas in the cayman islands 
the cayman islands government  through the water authority cayman  supplies water to parts of grand cayman  which are not within our licensed area  as well as to little cayman and cayman brac 
we operate all the reverse osmosis desalination plants owned by the water authority cayman on grand cayman and supply water under licenses and supply agreements held by oc cayman with the water authority cayman 
according to the most recent information published by the economics and statistics office of the cayman islands government  the population of the cayman islands was estimated in december to be approximately  according to the figures published by the department of tourism statistics information center  during the year ended december   tourist air arrivals increased by and tourist cruise ship arrivals increased by over the total visitors for the year increased from million in to million in we believe that our water sales in the cayman islands are more positively impacted by tourists that arrive by air than by those arriving by cruise ship  since cruise ship tourists generally only remain on island for one day or less as they do not remain on island overnight 
tourist air arrivals increased and cruise ship arrivals increased in january  compared to the same period in at this time we believe these trends will continue through in december  the ritz carlton hotel  condominiums and golf course development began operations 
this development is required to purchase potable water from us for the hotel and condominiums under the terms of our exclusive license agreement  but not for irrigation of its golf course 
during  the government of the cayman islands amended the development and planning law to permit construction of buildings up to seven stories in certain zones within our license area  including commercial and hotel zones 
previously  buildings in these zones were only permitted to be built to three stories 
we believe that this change in the law has and will continue to facilitate the development of certain properties within our license area that may have otherwise not developed under the old height restriction  and it has already facilitated the re development of a number of existing properties  which have been demolished re built under the terms of the new height restrictions 
the town of camana bay commenced construction in and will be developed over several decades 
the camana bay development is situated on acres stretching from the caribbean sea to the north sound within our retail license area on west bay beach  and is mixed use master planned community  which includes retail  residential and institutional properties 
our current operations in belize are located on ambergris caye  which consists of residential  commercial and tourist properties in the town of san pedro 
this town is located on the southern end of ambergris caye 
ambergris caye is one of many islands located east of the belize mainland and off the southeastern tip of the yucatan peninsula 
ambergris caye is approximately miles long and  according to the central statistical office belize mid year population estimates by region and sex  has a population of about  residents and is the second largest city in the belize district and the largest city in the belize rural south constituency 
we provide bulk potable water to bwsl  which distributes this water to this market 
bwsl currently has no other source of potable water on ambergris caye 
our contract with bwsl makes us their exclusive producer of desalinated water on ambergris caye though a mile long barrier reef  which is the largest barrier reef in the western hemisphere  is situated just offshore of ambergris caye 
this natural attraction is becoming a choice destination for scuba divers and tourists 
according to information published by the belize trade and investment development service  tourism is belize s second largest source of foreign income  next to agriculture 
our current operations in the bahamas are located on south bimini island and in nassau on new providence 
the bimini islands consist of north bimini and south bimini  and are two of islands which comprise the bahamas 
the bimini islands are located approximately miles east of ft 
lauderdale  florida and are a premier destination for sport fishing enthusiasts 
the population of the bimini islands is approximately  persons and the islands have about hotel and guest rooms available for tourists 
the total land area of the bimini islands is approximately square miles 
new providence  lyford caye and paradise island  connected by several bridges  are located approximately miles east southeast of the bimini islands 
with an area of square miles and a population of approximately  nassau is the political capital and commercial hub of the bahamas  and accounts for more than two thirds of the million tourists who visit the bahamas annually 
the british virgin islands are a british overseas territory and are situated east of puerto rico 
they consist of inhabited and more than uninhabited islands  of which tortola is the largest and most populated island 
the islands are the center for many large yacht chartering businesses 
competition cayman islands 
pursuant to our license granted by the cayman islands government  we have the exclusive right to provide potable  piped water within our licensed service area on grand cayman 
at the present time  we are the only non government owned public water utility on grand cayman 
the cayman islands government  through the water authority cayman  supplies water to parts of grand cayman located outside of our licensed service area 
although we have no competition within our exclusive retail license service area  our ability to expand our service area is at the discretion of the cayman island government 
prior to  any owner of property within our exclusive retail license service area could install water making equipment for its own use 
since  that option is only available to private residences  although water plants in existence prior to can be maintained but not replaced or expanded 
the cayman islands government  through the water authority cayman  supplies water to parts of grand cayman outside of our licensed service area 
we have competed with such companies as ge water  veolia  and ide for bulk water supply contracts with the water authority cayman 
belize 
on ambergris caye in belize  our water supply contract with belize water services limited is exclusive  and belize water services limited can no longer seek contracts with other water suppliers  or produce water themselves  to meet their future needs in san pedro  ambergris caye  belize 
the bahamas 
on south bimini island in the bahamas  we supply water to a private developer and do not have competitors 
ge water operates a seawater desalination plant on north bimini island 
we competed with companies such as ge water  veolia  ide  ohl inima and biwater for the new contract with the bahamian government to build and operate a seawater desalination plant at blue hill  new providence  bahamas 
we expect to compete with these companies and others for future water supply contracts in the bahamas 
british virgin islands 
in the british virgin islands  ge water operates seawater desalination plants in west end and sea cows bay  tortola  and on virgin gorda and generally bids against oc bvi for projects 
biwater plc was recently awarded a year contract to construct and operate a million us gallon per day desalination plant in tortola for the british virgin islands government 
to implement our growth strategy outside our existing operating areas  we will have to compete with some of the same companies we competed with for the blue hill project in nassau  bahamas such as ge water  veolia  ide technologies  ohl inima  and biwater and as well as other smaller companies 
some of these companies currently operate in areas in which we would like to expand our operations and already maintain worldwide operations having greater financial  managerial and other resources than our company 
we believe that our low overhead costs  knowledge of local markets and conditions and our efficient manner of operating desalinated water production and distribution equipment provide us with the capabilities to effectively compete for new projects in the caribbean basin and surrounding areas 
environmental matters cayman islands 
with respect to our cayman islands operations  although not required by local government regulations  we operate our water plants in accordance with guidelines of the cayman islands department of environment 
we are licensed by the government to discharge concentrated seawater  which is a byproduct of our desalination process  into deep disposal wells 
our cayman islands license requires that our potable water quality meet the world health organization s guidelines for drinking water quality and contain less than mg l of total dissolved solids 
belize  the bahamas  british virgin islands 
with respect to our belize and bahamas operations and oc bvi s british virgin islands operations  we and oc bvi are required by our water supply contracts to take all reasonable measures to prevent pollution of the environment 
we are licensed by the belize and bahamian governments to discharge concentrated seawater  which is a byproduct of our desalination process  into deep disposal wells 
oc bvi is licensed by the british virgin islands government to discharge concentrated seawater into the sea 
we operate our plants in a manner so as to minimize the emission of hydrogen sulfide gas into the environment 
we are not aware of any existing or pending environmental legislation  which may affect our operations 
to date we have not received any complaints from any regulatory authorities 
employees as of march   we employed a total of persons  in the cayman islands  in the bahamas  in the united states  two in bermuda and six in belize 
we also managed the five employees of oc bvi in the british virgin islands 
we have management personnel and administrative and clerical employees 
the remaining employees are engaged in engineering  purchasing  plant maintenance and operations  pipe laying and repair  leak detection  new customer connections  meter reading and laboratory analysis of water quality

our exclusive license to provide water to retail customers in the cayman islands may not be renewed in the future 
in the cayman islands  we provide water to retail customers under a year license issued to us in july by the cayman islands government that grants us the exclusive right to provide water to retail customers within our licensed service area 
our service area is comprised of an area on grand cayman that includes the seven mile beach and west bay areas  two of the three most populated areas in the cayman islands 
for the year ended december   we generated approximately of our consolidated revenues and of our consolidated gross profits from the retail water operations conducted pursuant to our exclusive license 
if we are not in default of any terms of the license  we have a right of first refusal to renew the license on terms that are no less favorable than those that the government offers to any third party 
this license was set to expire on july  however we and the cayman islands government have agreed in correspondence to extend the license three times in order to provide sufficient time to negotiate the terms of a new license agreement 
the most recent extension of the term of the license by correspondence expired on january   but  based on the acquiescence of the cayman islands government  we are continuing to supply water to the service area specified in the license in accordance with the terms and conditions of the original july license 
the license negotiations have been recently impacted by two matters on february  the water production and supply law  which replaces the water production and supply law revision under which we are licensed and the water authority amendment law  the new laws were published on terms that they would come into force on such date as may be appointed by order made by the governor in cabinet 
we have sought but not yet obtained any official confirmation that such an order has been issued and the new laws may therefore not be in force as at this date 
if the new laws are in force it would mean that any further negotiations would be required to be conducted with the water authority cayman as principal and that any new license would be issued pursuant to the provisions of the new laws which contemplate a rate of return on invested capital model as further discussed below  the cayman islands government has offered in writing to extend the license until negotiations are completed or april  whichever is the earlier  on terms that we forgo our contractual right to a rate increase in line with inflation as of january   and that april  be agreed as the final termination date for negotiations 
we have declined this offer  asserted our contractual rights to the rate increase  and proposed to continue in the interim the production and supply of water as it is an essential service to the cayman islands and we are the only entity in a position to continue that production and supply 
we are waiting to hear further from the cayman islands government 
no negotiation meetings have been held since the publication of the new laws 
at this stage we believe it is highly unlikely the license negotiations will be completed before the deadline april  deadline proposed by the cayman islands government 
we have been informed during our retail license renewal negotiations conducted with representatives of the cayman islands government that the cayman islands government seeks to restructure the terms of our license to employ a rate of return on invested capital model similar to that governing the sale of water to many us municipalities 
we have formally objected to the implementation of a rate of return on invested capital model on the basis that we believe that such a model would not promote the efficient operation of our water utility and could ultimately increase water rates to our customers 
we believe such a model  if ultimately implemented  could significantly reduce the operating income and cash flows we have historically generated from our retail license and require us to record an impairment loss to reduce the million carrying value of our retail segment s goodwill 
such impairment loss could be material to our results of operations 
if a new long term license agreement is not entered into with the government  we would retain a right of first refusal to renew the license on terms that are no less favorable than those that the government might offer in the future to a third party 
if we do not enter into a new license agreement  and no other party is awarded a license  we expect to be permitted to continue to supply water to its service area 
however  the terms of such continued supply may not be as favorable to us as the terms in the july  license agreement 
it is possible that the government could offer a third party a license to service some or all of our present service area 
in such event  we may assume the license offered to the third party by exercising our right of first refusal 
the terms of the new license agreement may not be as favorable to us as the terms under which we are presently operating and could reduce the operating income and cash flows we have historically generated from our retail license and require us to record an impairment loss to reduce the million carrying value of our retail segment s goodwill 
such impairment loss could be material to our results of operations 
we rely on fixed term water supply and or service agreements with our bulk customers in the cayman islands  belize and the bahamas  which may not be renewed or may be renewed on terms less favorable to us 
all of our bulk water supply agreements are for fixed terms ranging originally from seven to years and with a range of approximately two to years remaining 
upon expiration  these agreements may not be renewed or may be renewed on terms less favorable to us 
in addition  certain of these agreements for plants not owned by us provide for our customers to take over the operations of the plant upon expiration of the contract term 
if this occurs  we may no longer generate income from such plant 
in instances where we own the plant that produces the water under an agreement that is not renewed or renewed with lower production quantities  we may not be able to find a new customer for the plant s excess production capacity 
if our fixed term agreements are not renewed or are renewed on terms less favorable to us  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the value of our investment in our affiliate oc bvi is dependent upon the collection of amounts recently awarded by the eastern supreme court of the caribbean 
in october  the british virgin islands government notified oc bvi that it was asserting a purported right of ownership of oc bvi s desalination plant in baughers bay  tortola pursuant to the terms of the agreement and invited oc bvi to submit a proposal for its continued involvement in the production of water at the baughers bay plant 
early in  the british virgin islands government unilaterally took the position that until such time as a new agreement is reached on the ownership of the baughers bay plant and for the price of the water produced by the plant  the bvi government would only pay that amount of oc bvi s invoices that the bvi government purports constitutes oc bvi s costs of producing the water 
oc bvi responded to the bvi government that the amount the ministry proposed to pay was significantly less than oc bvi s production costs 
payments made by the bvi government to oc bvi since the bvi government s assumption of this reduced price were sporadic 
on november   oc bvi s management was informed that the bvi government had filed a lawsuit with the eastern caribbean supreme court the court seeking ownership and possession of the baughers bay plant 
oc bvi counterclaimed that it was entitled to continued possession and operation of the baughers bay plant until the bvi government pays oc bvi approximately million  which it believed represented the value of the baughers bay plant at its present expanded production capacity 
oc bvi also took the legal position that since the bvi government never paid the million to purchase the baughers bay plant  the agreement terminated on may   which was eight months after the date that the ministry provided written notice of its intention to purchase the plant 
on july   oc bvi filed a claim with the court  and on april  amended and increased this claim  seeking recovery of amounts for water sold and delivered to the bvi government from the baughers bay plant through may  based upon the contract prices in effect before the bvi government asserted its purported right of ownership of the plant 
the court held a trial in july to address both the baughers bay ownership issue and oc bvi s claim for payment of amounts owed for water sold and delivered to the bvi government 
on september   the court issued a preliminary ruling with respect to the litigation between the bvi government and oc bvi 
the court determined that the bvi government was entitled to immediate possession of the baughers bay plant and dismissed oc bvi s claim for compensation of approximately million for improvements to the plant 
however  the court determined that oc bvi was entitled to full payment of water invoices issued up to december   which had been calculated under the terms of the original water supply agreement  and ordered the bvi government to make an immediate interim payment of million to oc bvi for amounts owed to oc bvi 
the court deferred deciding the entire dispute between the parties until it could conduct a hearing to determine the reasonable rate for water produced by oc bvi for the period from december  to the present 
after conducting hearings in october the court ordered the bvi government to pay oc bvi at the rate of per thousand imperial gallons for water produced by oc bvi from december  to present  which amounted to a total recovery for oc bvi of million as of september  the bvi government made a payment of million to oc bvi under the court order during the fourth quarter of  a second payment of million under the court order in july and a third payment of million under the court order in february on october   oc bvi filed an appeal with the eastern caribbean court of appeals the appellate court asking the appellate court to review the september  ruling by the eastern caribbean supreme court as it relates to oc bvi s claim for compensation for improvements to the baughers bay plant 
on october   the bvi government filed an appeal with the appellate court seeking the appellate court s review of the september  ruling of the court that the bvi government pay oc bvi the reasonable rate for water produced by oc bvi for the period from december  to the present 
the bvi government is requesting a ruling from the appellate court that the bvi government should only pay oc bvi the actual cost of water produced at the plant 
after considering the september and october rulings of the court of the caribbean relating to the baughers bay dispute  we determined that the carrying value of our investment in oc bvi exceeded the estimated fair value for our investment in oc bvi by approximately  as of september  and therefore recognized an impairment loss of this amount on this investment during the three months ended september  in february  the bvi government announced it had signed a long term contract with another company for the construction of a new water plant to serve tortola 
we believe this new contract with another company makes it unlikely that oc bvi will be able to obtain a new long term operating contract for baughers bay 
accordingly  our calculation of the estimated fair value of our equity investment in oc bvi as of december  did not include any future cash flows to oc bvi from a long term operating contract for the baughers bay plant and as a result we recorded an additional impairment loss for our equity investment in oc bvi of  during the fourth quarter of the remaining carrying value of our investment in oc bvi of million as of december  assumes oc bvi will collect in full the remaining million awarded by the court and will not be required to return any of the million paid to date by the bvi government under the court order 
should the bvi government be successful in its appeal to reduce the million award  we will be required to record an additional impairment charge in an amount equal to any reduction in the amount previously awarded 
such impairment loss would reduce our earnings and could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we do not have sole control over our affiliate  oc bvi 
a divergence of our interests and the interests of oc bvi s other voting shareholder could adversely affect the operations of oc bvi and decrease the value of our investment in oc bvi 
we own of the equity and of the voting shares of oc bvi 
we and sage  which owns the remaining of the voting shares  are each entitled to appoint three of the six directors of oc bvi 
if there is a tie vote of the directors on any matter  the president of the caribbean water and wastewater association  a regional trade association comprised primarily of government representatives  is entitled to appoint a temporary director to cast the deciding vote 
as a result  although we provide operating management and engineering services to oc bvi  we share the overall management of oc bvi with sage and do not fully control its operations 
a divergence of our interests and the interests of sage could adversely affect the operations of oc bvi and in turn decrease the value of our investment in oc bvi  in which case we could be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our investment in oc bvi 
such an impairment charge would reduce our earnings and have a significant adverse impact on our result of operations and financial condition 
the profitability of our plants is dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate the costs of their construction and operation 
the cost estimates prepared in connection with the construction and operation of our plants are subject to inherent uncertainties 
additionally  the terms of our supply contracts may require us to guarantee the price of water on a per unit basis  subject to certain annual inflation and monthly fuel cost adjustments  and to assume the risk that the costs associated with producing this water may be greater than anticipated 
because we base our contracted price of water in part on our estimation of future construction and operating costs  the profitability of our plants is dependent on our ability to estimate these costs accurately 
the cost of materials and services and the cost of the delivery of such services may increase significantly after we submit our bid for a plant  which could cause the gross margin and net return on investment for a plant to be less than we anticipated when the bid was made 
the profit margins we initially expect to generate from a plant could be further reduced if future operating costs for that plant exceed our estimates of such costs 
these future operating costs could be affected by a variety of factors  including lower than anticipated production efficiencies and hydrological conditions at the plant site that differ materially from those that existed at the time we submitted our bid 
any construction and operating costs for our plants that significantly exceed our initial estimates could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
a significant portion of our consolidated revenues are derived from two customers 
a loss of  or a less favorable relationship with  either of these customers would adversely affect our results of operations 
our top two bulk water customers  the water authority cayman and the wsc  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  if either of these customers terminate or decide not to renew their contracts with us  or renew such contracts on terms that are less favorable to us  or become unable for financial or other reasons to comply with the terms of our contracts with them  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
our operations are affected by tourism and are subject to seasonal fluctuations which could affect demand for our water and impact our revenues and results of operations 
our operations are affected by the levels of tourism and are subject to seasonal variations in our service areas 
demand for our water in the cayman islands  belize  bimini and the bahamas is affected by variations in the level of tourism and local weather  primarily rainfall 
tourism in our service areas is affected by the economies of the tourists home countries  primarily the united states and europe  terrorist activity and perceived threats thereof  and increased costs of fuel and airfares 
we normally sell more water during the first and second quarters  when the number of tourists is greater and local rainfall is less  than in the third and fourth quarters 
a downturn in tourism or greater than expected rainfall in the locations we serve could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
we may have difficulty accomplishing our growth strategy within and outside of our current operating areas 
our expansion both within our current operating areas and into new areas involves significant risks  including  but not limited to  the following regulatory risks  including government relations difficulties  local regulations and currency controls  receiving and maintaining necessary permits  licenses and approvals  risks related to operating in foreign countries  including political instability  reliance on local economies  environmental problems  shortages of materials  immigration restrictions and limited skilled labor  risks related to development of new operations  including inaccurate assessment of the demand for water  engineering difficulties and inability to begin operations as scheduled  and risks relating to greater competition in these new territories  including the ability of our competitors to gain or retain market share by reducing prices 
even if we successfully expand our operations  we may have difficulty managing our growth 
we cannot assure you that any new operations within or outside of our current operating areas will attain or maintain profitability or that the results from these new operations will not negatively affect our overall profitability 
production shortfalls under any of our bulk supply contracts could result in penalties or cancellation of the contract 
our bulk water supply contracts require us to deliver specified minimum volumes of water 
during a period from october to february  we were unable to deliver the minimum water volumes required under one of our bulk water supply contracts because of mechanical equipment problems and membrane fouling 
at present  we believe we have resolved the minimum supply issues for this plant 
however  membrane fouling or other technical problems could occur at any of our plants  and if we are unable to meet the production minimums due to such operating issues  we could be in technical default of the supply contract and subject to various adverse consequences  including financial penalties or cancellation of the contract 
we have committed up to million to fund the developmental costs for a possible project in mexico  and may elect to expend more than this million to pursue this project 
however  we could decide in the future  after expending these funds  that the project is not viable 
in may  we acquired  through our wholly owned netherlands subsidiary  consolidated water cooperatief  ua  a interest in nsc agua  nsc de nsc  nsc a mexican company 
nsc has been formed to pursue a project encompassing the construction  ownership and operation of a million gallon per day seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant to be located in northern baja california  mexico and an accompanying pipeline to deliver water to the us border 
we and our partners in nsc believe such a project can be successful due to what we anticipate will be a growing need for a new potable water supply for the areas of northern baja california  mexico and southern california  united states 
to complete this project we have engaged an engineering group with extensive regional experience and have partnered with doosan heavy industries and construction  a global leader in the engineering  procurement and construction of large seawater desalination plants 
once completed  we would operate the plant while retaining a minority position in its ownership 
nsc is in the development stage  and is presently involved in seeking contracts for the purchase of land on which to build the plant and for the electric power and feed water sources for the plant s proposed operations 
in addition to obtaining these contracts  nsc will be required to complete various other steps before it can commence construction of the plant and pipeline including  but not limited to  obtaining approvals and permits from various governmental agencies in mexico and the united states  securing contracts with its proposed customers to sell water in sufficient quantities and at prices that make the project financially viable  and obtaining equity and debt financing for the project 
nsc s potential customers will also be required to obtain various governmental permits and approvals in order to purchase water from nsc 
for our interest in nsc  we have agreed to provide initial funding of up to million in the form of equity for nsc s development activities 
because we exercise effective financial control over nsc and our partners in nsc will not participate in funding the first million in losses that nsc may incur  we consolidate nsc s results of operations 
included in our consolidated results of operations for year ended december  is approximately million in general and administrative expenses  consisting of organizational  legal  accounting  engineering  consulting and other costs relating to the project development activities of nsc 
approximately million and  of our initial funding commitment remained as of december  and the date of this filing  respectively 
we anticipate that substantially all of the initial funding we provide for nsc s development activities will be expensed 
we may decide to expend significant funds beyond the initial million to continue to pursue this project  including those necessary to purchase the land for the plant 
we estimate that it will take approximately one year for nsc to complete all of the activities which include purchasing the land for the plant  securing feed water and power supplies  completing the engineering and feasibility studies  negotiating the customer contracts  obtaining the required permits and arranging the project financing necessary to commence construction of the plant 
however  completing these activities could take significantly longer than a year 
nsc may ultimately be unable to complete all the activities required to proceed with the project 
our operations could be harmed by hurricanes or tropical storms 
a hurricane or tropical storm could cause major damage to our equipment and properties and the properties of our customers  including the large tourist properties in our areas of operation 
for example  in september hurricane ivan caused significant damage to our plants and our customers properties  which adversely affected our revenues 
any future damage could cause us to lose use of our equipment and properties and incur additional repair costs 
damage to our customers properties and the adverse impact on tourism could result in a decrease in water demand 
a hurricane or tropical storm could also disrupt the delivery of equipment and supplies  including electricity  necessary to our operations 
these and other possible effects of hurricanes or tropical storms could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
contamination of our processed water may cause disruption in our services and adversely affect our revenues 
our processed water may become contaminated by natural occurrences and by inadvertent or intentional human interference  including acts of terrorism 
in the event that a portion of our processed water is contaminated  we may have to interrupt the supply of water until we are able to install treatment equipment or substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water production source 
in addition  we may incur significant costs in order to treat a contaminated source of plant feed water through expansion of our current treatment facilities  or development of new treatment methods 
an inability by us to substitute processed water from an uncontaminated water source or to adequately treat the contaminated plant feed water in a cost effective manner may have an adverse effect on our revenues and our results of operations 
potential government decisions  actions and regulations could negatively affect our operations 
we are subject to the local regulations of the cayman islands  belize  the british virgin islands  the bahamas and bermuda  all of which are subject to change 
any government that regulates our operations may issue legislation or adopt new regulations  including but not limited to restricting foreign ownership of us  providing for the expropriation of our assets by the government  providing for nationalization of public utilities by the government  providing for different water quality standards  unilaterally changing or renegotiating our licenses and agreements  restricting the transfer of us currency  or causing currency exchange fluctuations devaluations or making changes in tax laws 
as new laws and regulations are issued  we may be required to modify our operations and business strategy  which we may be unable to do in a cost effective manner 
failure by us to comply with applicable regulations could result in the loss of our licenses or authorizations to operate  the assessment of penalties or fines  or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the rates we charge our retail customers in the cayman islands are subject to regulation 
if we are unable to obtain government approval of our requests for rate increases  or if approved rate increases are untimely or inadequate to cover our projected expenses  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
under our exclusive retail license in the cayman islands  we must obtain prior approval from the cayman islands government to increase our water supply rates  except for inflation related and energy related adjustments 
however  the expenses we incur in supplying water under this license may increase due to circumstances that were unforeseen at the time we entered into the license 
we may incur additional costs in attempting to obtain government approval of any rate increase  which may be granted on a delayed basis  if at all 
failure to obtain timely and adequate rate increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we rely on the efforts of key employees 
our failure to retain these employees could adversely affect our results of operations 
our success depends upon the abilities of our executive officers 
in particular  the loss of the services of fredrick w 
mctaggart  our president and chief executive officer  could be detrimental to our operations and our continued success 
mr 
mctaggart has an employment agreement expiring on december  each year  the term of this agreement may be extended for an additional year 
however  we cannot guarantee that mr 
mctaggart will continue to work for us during the term of his agreement or will enter into any extensions thereof 
we are exposed to credit risk through our relationships with several customers and our affiliate 
we are subject to credit risk posed by possible defaults in payment by our bulk water customers in the cayman islands  belize  the british virgin islands and the bahamas and by possible defaults in payment of loan receivables by oc bvi and the water authority cayman 
adverse economic conditions affecting  or financial difficulties of  those parties could impair their ability to pay us or cause them to delay payment 
we depend on these parties to pay us on a timely basis 
our outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collateral or credit insurance 
any delay or default in payment could adversely affect our cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to the risk of variations in currency exchange rates 
although we report our results in united states dollars  the majority of our revenue is earned in other currencies 
all of the currencies in our operating areas other than the mexican peso have been fixed to the united states dollar for over years and we do not employ a hedging strategy against exchange rate risk associated with our reporting in united states dollars 
if any of these fixed exchange rates becomes a floating exchange rate our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we may enter new markets in the future in which we do not have a contractual commitment for our products or existing customers 
our strategy contemplates potential entry into new markets  such as mexico  where we believe a demand for potable water exists beyond the current supply of potable water in those markets 
we may incur significant business development expenses in the pursuit of new markets prior to obtaining a contract for services in these markets  and such expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we may decide to enter such markets by building new reverse osmosis desalination plants before we have obtained a contract for the sale of water produced by the new plant or before we have established a customer base for the water produced by the new plant 
if after completing such plant we are unable to obtain a contract or sufficient number of customers for the plant  we may be unable to recover the cost of our investment in the plant  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
future sales of our common shares may depress the market price of our common shares 
if we or our existing shareholders sell substantial amounts of common shares or if it is perceived that such sales could occur  the market price of our common shares could decline 
in addition  if these sales were to occur  we may find it difficult to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem desirable 
we may not pay dividends in the future 
if dividends are paid  they may be in lesser amounts than past dividends 
our shareholders may receive dividends out of legally available funds if  and when  they are declared by our board of directors 
we have paid dividends in the past  but may cease to do so at any time 
under the agreements governing certain of our outstanding debt obligations  we may only pay dividends from cash flows  defined under the applicable agreement as consolidated net income plus non cash charges less capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayment  calculated annually on a fiscal year basis 
we may incur increased capital requirements or additional indebtedness in the future that may restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends 
we may also be restricted from paying dividends in the future due to restrictions imposed by applicable corporate laws  our financial condition and results of operations  covenants contained in our financing agreements  management s assessment of future capital needs and other factors considered by our board of directors 
we may not continue to pay dividends in the future or  if dividends are paid  they may not be in amounts similar to past dividends 
service of process and enforcement of legal proceedings commenced against us in the united states may be difficult to obtain 
we are incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside of the united states 
in addition  out of of our directors and officers reside outside the united states 
as a result  it may be difficult for investors to affect service of process within the united states upon us and such other persons  or to enforce judgments obtained against such persons in united states courts  and bring any action  including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the united states securities laws 
in addition  it may be difficult for investors to enforce  in original actions brought in courts or jurisdictions located outside of the united states  rights predicated upon the united states securities laws 
based on the advice of our cayman islands legal counsel  we believe there is no reciprocal statutory enforcement of foreign judgments between the united states and the cayman islands  and that foreign judgments originating from the united states are not directly enforceable in the cayman islands 
a prevailing party in a united states proceeding against us or our officers or directors would have to initiate a new proceeding in the cayman islands using the united states judgment as evidence of the party s claim 
a prevailing party could rely on the summary judgment procedures available in the cayman islands  subject to available defenses in the cayman islands courts  including  but not limited to  the lack of competent jurisdiction in the united states courts  lack of due service of process in the united states proceeding and the possibility that enforcement or recognition of the united states judgment would be contrary to the public policy of the cayman islands 
depending on the nature of damages awarded  civil liabilities under the securities act of  as amended or the securities act  or the securities exchange act of  as amended or the exchange act  for original actions instituted outside the cayman islands may or may not be enforceable 
for example  a united states judgment awarding remedies unobtainable in any legal action in the courts of the cayman islands  such as treble damages  would likely not be enforceable under any circumstances 
low trading volume of our stock may limit your ability to sell your shares at or above the price you pay for them 
during the year ended december   the average daily trading volume of our common shares was approximately  shares  a much lower trading volume than the stock of many other companies listed on the nasdaq global select market 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common shares at any given time 
this presence in turn depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control 
as a consequence of the limited volume of trading in our common shares  an investor in our stock may have difficulty selling a large number of our common shares in the manner or at the price that might be attainable if our common shares were more actively traded 
in addition  as a result of our low trading volume  the market price of our common shares may not accurately reflect their value 
competition may threaten the sustainability and growth of our current operations and impede the expansion of our operations into new areas 
we face competition in our areas of operation in renewing our present supply contracts and in our efforts to expand our current operations within those areas 
we also face competition in attempting to expand our operations to new areas 
we often compete with larger companies  including units of general electric company and veolia environment 
some of our current and potential competitors have technical and financial resources and marketing and service organizations that are significantly greater than ours 
moreover  our competitors may forecast the course of market developments more accurately and could in the future develop new technologies that compete with our services 
additional competitors with significant market presence and financial resources may enter those markets  thereby further intensifying competition 
these competitors may be able to reduce our market share by adopting more aggressive pricing policies than we can adopt or by developing technology and services that gain wider market acceptance than our technology and or services 
if we do not compete successfully  we may be unable to maintain or increase our operations and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we are subject to anti takeover measures that may discourage  delay or prevent changes of control of consolidated water co 
ltd 
classified board of directors 
we have a classified board that consists of three groups of directors 
only one group of directors is elected each year 
our classified board may increase the length of time necessary for an acquirer to change the composition of a majority of directors in order to gain control of our board 
option deed 
our board of directors has adopted an option deed that is intended to improve the bargaining position of our board of directors in the event of an unsolicited offer to acquire our outstanding stock 
under the terms of the option deed  a stock purchase right is attached to each of our current or future outstanding common shares issued prior to the time the purchase rights become exercisable  are redeemed or expire 
the purchase rights will become exercisable only if an individual or group has acquired  or obtained the right to acquire  or announced a tender or exchange offer that if consummated would result in such individual or group acquiring beneficial ownership of or more of our outstanding common shares 
upon the occurrence of a triggering event  the rights will entitle every holder of our common shares  other than the acquirer  to purchase our shares or shares of our successor on terms that would likely be economically dilutive to the acquirer 
under certain circumstances  instead of common shares  our board of directors may issue cash or debt securities 
our board of directors  however  has the power to amend the option deed so that it does not apply to a particular acquisition proposal or to redeem the rights for a nominal value before they become exercisable 
these features will likely encourage an acquirer to negotiate with our board of directors before commencing a tender offer or to condition a tender offer on our board of directors taking action to prevent the purchase rights from becoming exercisable 
in march  our board extended the expiration date of the option deed through july as a result of these anti takeover measures  we could deter efforts to make changes to  or exercise control over  current management 
in addition  our shareholders may not have an opportunity to sell their common shares to a potential acquirer at the acquirer s offering price  which is typically at a premium to market price 
restrictive covenants in our credit facilities and trust deeds could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility  our failure to comply with these covenants could cause foreclosure on our assets 
our credit facilities and the trust deeds governing the terms of our debt securities contain restrictive covenants 
these covenants and requirements limit our ability  without approval of the lender or trustee  to take various actions  including incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures  guaranteeing indebtedness  engaging in various types of transactions  including mergers and sales of assets  and paying dividends and making distributions or other restricted payments 
these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may not be required to operate under these or similar restrictions 
further  these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing  acquisition or investment opportunities 
a material breach of any of these covenants would constitute a default under our credit facilities or trust deeds 
in the event of default  the lender or trustee may accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness 
if we are unable to repay the amounts accelerated  the lender or trustee has the right to foreclose on substantially all of our assets  which we have pledged to secure that indebtedness 
foreclosure upon our assets would have a significant adverse affect on our results of operations  financial condition and our ability to continue operations

we intend to increase revenues by developing new business opportunities both within our current service areas and in new areas 
we expect to maintain operating efficiencies by continuing to focus on our successful business model and by properly executing our equipment maintenance and water loss mitigation programs 
we believe that many water scarce countries in the caribbean basin  north  central and south america  and other select markets present opportunities for operation of our plants in favorable regulatory environments 
our operations and activities are now conducted at plants in five countries the cayman islands  the bahamas  the british virgin islands  belize and bermuda and in three business segments retail  bulk and services

cayman islands we have been operating our business on grand cayman island since and have been using ro technology to convert seawater to potable water since there is a limited natural supply of fresh water on the cayman islands 
we currently have an exclusive license from the cayman islands government to process potable water from seawater and then sell and distribute that water by pipeline to seven mile beach and west bay  grand cayman 
our operations consist of eight reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants which provide water to approximately  retail residential and commercial customers within a government licensed area and bulk water sales to the water authority cayman 
our pipeline system in the cayman islands covers the seven mile beach and west bay areas of grand cayman and consists of approximately miles of polyvinyl chloride and high density polyethylene pipe 
bahamas cw bahamas produces potable water from three reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants 
two of these plants  the windsor plant and the blue hill plant  are located in new providence and have a total installed capacity of million us gallons per day 
cw bahamas supplies water from these plants on a take or pay basis to the water and sewerage corporation of the bahamas under long term build  own and operate supply agreements 
during  we supplied approximately billion us gallons billion us gallons of water to the water and sewerage corporation from these plants 
cw bahamas third plant is located in bimini  has a capacity of  us gallons per day  and provides potable water to the bimini sands resort and to the bimini beach hotel 
we have also sold water intermittently to the wsc from our bimini plant when their regular supply was unavailable 
belize our belize operation  which was acquired on july   consists of one reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant on ambergris caye  belize  central america capable of producing  us gallons per day 
we sell water to one customer  belize water services limited  which then distributes the water through its own distribution system to residential  commercial and tourist properties on ambergris caye 
british virgin islands we hold an equity position in  and shared management of  oc bvi 
this affiliate produces potable water from two reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants located at bar bay  tortola and the island of jost van dyke 
the plants at bar bay and jost van dyke have a total installed capacity of  and  us gallons per day  respectively  and provide water to the department of water and sewerage of the ministry of communications and works of the government of the british virgin islands 
during the three years ended december   oc bvi also sold water to the department of water and sewerage from a plant with a million us gallon per day capacity located at baughers bay  tortola 
however  on march   as the result of the legal resolution of an on going dispute between oc bvi and the bvi government over ownership of this plant  oc bvi vacated the baughers bay plant and the bvi government assumed direct responsibility for the its operations 
bermuda in june  we formed a bermuda based affiliate  cw bermuda with two other shareholders 
we own of the equity interest and voting rights of cw bermuda 
cw bermuda has entered into a contract with the government of bermuda for the design  construction  sale and operation of a desalination plant in two phases  located on tynes bay along the northern coast of bermuda 
phase i of the plant was completed at the end of and began operating during the second quarter of phase ii of the plant is substantially complete but has not been commissioned 
we expect to operate the plant into the second quarter of we have entered into a management services agreement with cw bermuda for the design  construction and operation of the tynes bay plant  under which we receive fees for direct services  purchasing activities and proprietary technology 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results could differ significantly from such estimates and assumptions 
certain of our accounting estimates or assumptions constitute critical accounting estimates for us due to the fact that the nature of these estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition and results of operations is material 
our critical accounting estimates relate to i the valuation of our equity investment in our affiliate  oc bvi  ii goodwill and intangible assets  and iii plant construction revenues and costs 
valuation of equity investment in affiliate 
we account for our investment in oc bvi under the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
this method requires recognition of a loss on an equity investment that is other than temporary  and indicates that a current fair value of an equity investment that is less than its carrying amount may indicate a loss in the value of the investment 
oc bvi s on going dispute with the bvi government relating to its baughers bay plant may indicate that the current fair value of our investment in oc bvi is less than our carrying value for this investment 
as a quoted market price for oc bvi s stock is not available  to test for possible impairment of our investment in oc bvi we estimate its fair value by calculating the expected cash flows from our investment in oc bvi by i identifying various possible outcomes of the baughers bay dispute  ii estimating the cash flows associated with each possible outcome  and iii assigning a probability to each outcome based upon discussions held to date by oc bvi s management with the bvi government and oc bvi s legal counsel 
the resulting probability weighted sum represents the expected cash flows  and our best estimate of future cash flows  to be derived from our investment in oc bvi 
the identification of the possible outcomes for the baughers bay dispute  the projections of cash flows for each outcome  and the assignment of relative probabilities to each outcome all represent significant estimates made by us 
while we have used our best judgment to identify the possible outcomes and expected cash flows for these outcomes and assign relative probabilities to each outcome  these estimates are by their nature highly subjective and are also subject to material change by our management over time based upon additional information from oc bvi s management and legal counsel  a change in the status of negotiations and or oc bvi s litigation with the bvi government 
after considering the september and october rulings of the eastern supreme court of the caribbean relating to the baughers bay dispute  we determined that the carrying value of our investment in oc bvi exceeded the estimated fair value for our investment in oc bvi by approximately  as of september  and therefore recognized an impairment loss of this amount on this investment during the three months ended september  in february  the bvi government announced that it had signed a year contract with another company for the construction and operation of a water plant that will provide potable water to the greater tortola area and we believe replace the current production of the baughers bay plant 
as a result of the decision by the bvi government to enter into the agreement with another company  we concluded that it was unlikely that oc bvi would derive any significant future revenues from an operating contract for the baughers bay plant 
consequently  we determined that an additional impairment loss of  was required and was recorded during the fourth quarter of to reduce our investment in oc bvi to its estimated fair value 
the remaining carrying value of our investment in oc bvi as of december  of million assumes that the bvi government will ultimately pay oc bvi the full amount awarded by the eastern supreme court in its rulings 
the bvi government has appealed these rulings  and the appellate court could ultimately overturn the rulings of the eastern supreme court or require the bvi government to pay oc bvi an amount lower than the amount awarded by the eastern supreme court 
if either of these occur  the actual cash flows from oc bvi could vary materially from the expected cash flows we used in determining oc bvi s fair value as of december   and we could be required to record an additional loss to reduce the carrying value of our investment in oc bvi 
such impairment loss would reduce our earnings and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess costs over fair value of the assets of an acquired business 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination accounted for as a purchase and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually 
generally accepted accounting principles require the amortization of intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment periodically 
we evaluate the possible impairment of goodwill annually 
management identifies our reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit by calculating the expected cash flows from each reporting unit and compare the fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we are required to perform the second step of the impairment test  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
in this step  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
if the implied fair value is less than its carrying amount  the impairment loss is recorded 
based upon our annual tests to date  we have not experienced any impairment losses on our recorded amounts of goodwill 
plant construction revenue and cost of plant construction revenue 
we recognize revenue and related costs as work progresses on fixed price contracts for the construction of desalination plants to be sold to third parties using the percentage of completion method  which relies on contract revenue and estimates of total expected costs 
we follow this method since we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract 
under the percentage of completion method  we record revenue and recognize profit or loss as work on the contract progresses 
our engineering personnel estimate total project costs and profit to be earned on each long term  fixed price contract prior to commencement of work on the contract and update these estimates as work on the contract progresses 
the cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at a specified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenue that incurred costs to date comprise of estimated total contract costs 
as work progresses  if the actual contract costs exceed estimates  the profit recognized on revenue from that contract decreases 
we recognize the full amount of any estimated loss on a contract at the time the estimates indicate such a loss 
to date we have not experienced a material adverse variation from our cost estimates for plants constructed for sale to third parties 
we assume the risk that the costs associated with constructing the plant may be greater than we anticipated in preparing our bid 
however  the terms of each of the sales contracts with our customers require us to guarantee the sales price for the plant at the bid amount 
because we base our contracted sales price in part on our estimation of future construction costs  the profitability of our plant sales is dependent on our ability to estimate these costs accurately 
the cost estimates we prepare in connection with the construction of plants to be sold to third parties are subject to inherent uncertainties 
the cost of materials and construction may increase significantly after we submit our bid for a plant due to factors beyond our control  which could cause the gross margin for a plant to be less than we anticipated when the bid was made 
the profit margin we initially expect to generate from a plant sale could be further affected by other factors  such as hydro geologic conditions at the plant site that differ materially from those we believed existed and relied upon when we submitted our bid

the volume of gallons sold in by the retail segment decreased by approximately from to the decline in retail revenues from to is principally attributable to the annual inflation related adjustment made to our base rates made during the first quarter of each year 
this adjustment decreased our rates in due to a downward movement in the consumer price indices from to used to determine such adjustment 
retail segment gross profit was  of revenues and  of revenues for and  respectively 
the decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenues from to reflects the base rate adjustment discussed in the previous paragraph 
as of the date of this filing we have not concluded negotiations with the cayman islands government for an extension of our retail license 
the outcome of these negotiations could have a material impact on the amounts of revenues and gross profit we have historically generated from our retail segment

the decline in bulk gross profit from to reflects the annual inflation related adjustment made during the first quarter of to the base rates charged by ocean conversion cayman 
this adjustment reduced occ s rates in due to a downward movement in the consumer price indices used to determine such adjustment 
the bulk segment s gross profit was also affected by the loss of the relatively higher margins earned on the previous contract the extension for which expired in late for the red gate plant  coupled with the delay in completing the refurbishment of this plant 
bulk segment g a expenses were  and  for and  respectively 
the decrease in this segment s g a expenses from to is primarily due to approximately  in penalties and interest assessed to our belize operations in relating to delinquent business taxes and a decrease in bank charges of approximately  for our bahamas operations 
the belize penalties and interest arose because we were erroneously informed in the past that our belize subsidiary was not subject to these taxes 
the bank charges incurred in resulted from the conversion of bahamas dollars into us dollars and the transfer of such dollars from the bahamas to grand cayman 
services segment the services segment incurred a loss from operations of  for the year ended december  the services segment contributed  to our income from operations for the year ended december services segment revenues were  and  for and  respectively

liquidity and capital resources overview our sources of cash are i revenues generated from our retail license  plant operating contracts and management agreements  ii borrowings under term loans  credit facilities and debt securities  and iii sales of equity securities 
our cash flows from operations are affected by tourism  rainfall patterns  weather conditions such as hurricanes  changes in our customer base  the timing and level of rate increases  overall economic conditions and other factors and the timing of the collection of these revenues from our customers 
our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets is impacted by our current and anticipated financial results  financial condition  existing level of borrowings  credit rating  and terms of debt agreements including our compliance therewith  and by conditions in the debt and equity markets

material commitments  expenditures and contingencies oc bvi contract dispute in october  our affiliate oc bvi notified us that the ministry of communications and works of the government of the british virgin islands the ministry had asserted a purported right of ownership of the baughers bay plant pursuant to the terms of the water supply agreement between the parties dated may the agreement and had invited oc bvi to submit a proposal for its continued involvement in the production of water at the baughers bay plant in light of the ministry s planned assumption of ownership 
under the terms of the agreement  upon the expiration of the initial seven year term in may  the agreement would automatically be extended for another seven year term unless the ministry provided notice  at least eight months prior to such expiration  of its decision to purchase the plant from oc bvi for approximately million 
in correspondence between the parties from late through early  the ministry indicated that the bvi government intended to purchase the plant but would be amenable to negotiating a new water supply agreement  and that it considered the agreement to be in force on a monthly basis until negotiations between the bvi government and oc bvi were concluded 
occasional discussions were held between the parties since without resolution of the matter 
oc bvi has continued to supply water to the ministry and expended approximately million between and to significantly expand the production capacity of the plant beyond that contemplated in the agreement 
early in  the ministry unilaterally took the position that until such time as a new agreement was reached on the ownership of the plant and the price for the water produced by the plant  the ministry would only pay that amount of oc bvi s billings that the ministry purported constituted oc bvi s costs of producing the water 
oc bvi responded to the ministry that the amount the ministry proposed to pay was significantly less than oc bvi s production costs 
payments made by the ministry to oc bvi since the ministry s assumption of this reduced price have been sporadic 
on november   oc bvi issued a demand letter to the bvi government for approximately million representing amounts that oc bvi claimed were due by the bvi government for water sold and delivered plus interest and legal fees 
in response to oc bvi s demand for payment  the bvi government issued a letter dated november  that reasserted its claim that ownership of the baughers bay plant has passed to the bvi government and rejected oc bvi s claim for payment 
on november   oc bvi s management was informed that the bvi government had filed a lawsuit with the eastern caribbean supreme court the court seeking ownership of the baughers bay plant 
oc bvi counterclaimed that it was entitled to continued possession and operation of the baughers bay plant until the bvi government paid oc bvi approximately million  which it believes represents the value of the baughers bay plant at its present expanded production capacity 
oc bvi took the legal position that since the bvi government never paid the million to purchase the baughers bay plant  the agreement terminated on may   which was eight months after the date that the ministry provided written notice of its intention to purchase the plant 
on july   oc bvi filed a claim with the court  and on april  amended and increased this claim  seeking payment for water sold and delivered to the bvi government through may  at the contract prices in effect before the bvi government asserted its purported right of ownership of the plant 
the court held a three day trial from july through july  to address both the baughers bay ownership issue and oc bvi s claim for payment of amounts owed for water sold and delivered to the bvi government 
on september   the court issued a preliminary ruling with respect to the litigation between the bvi government and oc bvi 
the court determined that the bvi government was entitled to immediate possession of the baughers bay plant and dismissed oc bvi s claim for compensation of approximately million for of expenditures made to expand the production capacity of the plant 
as a result of this determination by the court  oc bvi recorded an impairment loss of approximately million during the three months ended september  for fixed assets associated with the baughers bay plant 
however  the court determined that oc bvi was entitled to full payment of water invoices issued up to december   which had been calculated under the terms of the original agreement  and ordered the bvi government to make an immediate interim payment of million to oc bvi for amounts owed to oc bvi 
the court deferred deciding the entire dispute between the parties until it could conduct a hearing to determine the reasonable rate for water produced by oc bvi for the period from december  to the present 
after conducting hearings on october and   on october   the court ordered the bvi government to pay oc bvi at the rate of per thousand imperial gallons for water produced by oc bvi from december  to present  which amounted to a total recovery for oc bvi of million 
the bvi government made a payment of million to oc bvi under the court order during the fourth quarter of  a second payment of million under the court order during july and a third payment under the court order of million in february on october   oc bvi filed an appeal with the eastern caribbean court of appeals the appellate court asking the appellate court to review the september  ruling by the eastern caribbean supreme court as it relates to oc bvi s claim for compensation for expenditures made to expand the production capacity of the baughers bay plant 
on october   the bvi government filed an appeal with the appellate court seeking the appellate court s review of the september  ruling of the court that the bvi government pay oc bvi the reasonable rate for water produced by oc bvi for the period from december  to the present 
the bvi government is requesting a ruling from the appellate court that the bvi government should only pay oc bvi the actual cost of water produced at the plant 
under us generally accepted accounting principles revenue is generally realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
effective january   oc bvi changed its policy for the recording of its revenues from the baughers bay plant from the accrual to the equivalent of the cash method due to an inability to meet all of the above revenue recognition criteria 
as a result of this adjustment to oc bvi s revenues  we recorded losses from our equity in oc bvi s results of operations for all fiscal quarters of and for the first three quarters of any cash payments made by the bvi government on baughers bay related invoices were applied by oc bvi to the remaining balance of outstanding accounts receivable that arose from billings for periods prior to and including december and thus were not recognized as revenues 
sufficient payments were received from the bvi government during the three months ended september  to repay the remaining accounts receivable balances relating to period prior to december  oc bvi continues to apply the equivalent of the cash method with respect to the recognition of revenues from baughers bay 
consequently  oc bvi will not recognize as revenues any amounts to be paid to oc bvi as a result of the court ruling until such amounts are paid by the bvi government 
through december  the bvi government had made million in payments on the court order to oc bvi and during february the bvi government paid oc bvi another million on the court order 
in february  the bvi government announced that it had signed a year contract with another company for the construction and operation of a water plant that will provide potable water to the greater tortola area and we believe will replace the current production of the baughers bay plant 
we account for our investment in oc bvi in accordance with the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
this method requires recognition of a loss on an equity investment that is other than temporary  and indicates that a current fair value of an equity investment that is less than its carrying amount may indicate a loss in the value of the investment 
to test for possible impairment of our investment in oc bvi  we estimate its fair value as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
in making this estimate  we calculate the expected cash flows from our investment in oc bvi by i identifying various possible outcomes of the baughers bay litigation  ii estimating the cash flows associated with the bar bay plant and each possible baughers bay outcome  and iii assigning a probability to each baughers bay outcome based upon discussions held to date by oc bvi s management with the bvi government and oc bvi s legal counsel 
the resulting probability weighted sum represents the expected cash flows  and our best estimate of future cash flows  to be derived from our investment in oc bvi 
after considering the september and october rulings of the court  we determined that the carrying value of our investment in oc bvi exceeded the estimated fair value for our investment in oc bvi by approximately  as of september  and therefore recognized an impairment loss of this amount on this investment during the three months ended september  as a result of the decision by the bvi government to enter into the agreement with another company to build a new plant to serve tortola  we concluded that it is unlikely that oc bvi will derive any significant future revenues from an operating contract for the baughers bay plant 
consequently  we determined that an additional impairment loss of  was required and was recorded during the fourth quarter of to reduce our investment in oc bvi to its estimated fair value 
based upon the estimated fair value determined as of december  and the developments since that date to the date of this filing  we concluded that no impairment loss was required to be recognized on our investment in oc bvi during the year ended december  this conclusion assumes that the bvi government will fulfill its obligations under the bar bay agreement and that oc bvi will collect all of the million awarded by the court of which only million has been received to date 
the appellate court could ultimately overturn the ruling of the court  which currently requires the bvi government to pay oc bvi at the rate of per thousand imperial gallons for water previously supplied  or the appellate court could reduce the amount awarded to oc bvi under the court order  or the bvi government could fail to honor the terms of its agreement for water supplied by oc bvi s other plant located at bar bay  tortola 
if any of these events occur the actual cash flows from oc bvi could vary materially from the expected cash flows we used in determining oc bvi s fair value as of december  and we could be required to record an additional impairment loss to reduce the carrying value of our investment in oc bvi 
such impairment loss would reduce our earnings and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
mexico affiliate in may  we acquired  through our recently organized wholly owned netherlands subsidiary  consolidated water cooperatief  ua  a interest in nsc agua  nsc de nsc  nsc a mexican company 
nsc has been formed to pursue a project encompassing the construction  ownership and operation of a million gallon per day seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant to be located in northern baja california  mexico and an accompanying pipeline to deliver water to the us border 
we and our partners in nsc believe such a project can be successful due to what we anticipate will be a growing need for a new potable water supply for the areas of northern baja california  mexico and southern california  united states 
to complete this project we have engaged an engineering group with extensive regional experience and have partnered with doosan heavy industries and construction  a global leader in the engineering  procurement and construction of large seawater desalination plants 
once completed  we would operate the plant while retaining a minority position in its ownership 
nsc is in the development stage  and is presently involved in seeking contracts for the purchase of land on which to build the plant and for the electric power and feed water sources for the plant s proposed operations 
in addition to obtaining these contracts  nsc will be required to complete various other steps before it can commence construction of the plant and pipeline including  but not limited to  obtaining approvals and permits from various governmental agencies in mexico and the united states  securing contracts with its proposed customers to sell water in sufficient quantities and at prices that make the project financially viable  and obtaining equity and debt financing for the project 
nsc s potential customers will also be required to obtain various governmental permits and approvals in order to purchase water from nsc 
for our interest in nsc  we have agreed to provide initial funding of million in the form of equity for nsc s development activities 
because we exercise effective financial control over nsc and our partners in nsc will not participate in funding the first million in losses that nsc may incur  we consolidate nsc s results of operations 
included in our consolidated results of operations for year ended december  is approximately million in general and administrative expenses  consisting of organizational  legal  accounting  engineering  consulting and other costs relating to the project development activities of nsc 
approximately million and  of our initial funding commitment remained as of december  and the date of this filing  respectively 
we anticipate that substantially all of this initial funding we provide for nsc s development activities will be expensed 
upon completion of nsc s development activities we may decide to expend significant funds beyond the million to continue to pursue this project  including those necessary to purchase the land for the plant 
we estimate that it will take approximately one year for nsc to complete all of the activities which include purchasing the land for the plant  securing feed water and power supplies  completing the engineering and feasibility studies  negotiating the customer contracts  obtaining the required permits and arranging the project financing necessary to commence construction of the plant 
however  completing these activities could take significantly longer than a year 
nsc may ultimately be unable to complete all the activities required to proceed with the project

expansion of blue hill plant cw bahamas plant water supply agreement with the wsc for its blue hills was amended effective january  under the terms of the amended agreement we are required to increase the production capacity of the blue hills plant to million us gallons per day on or before september  after the expansion is completed  we will be required to deliver and the wsc will be required to purchase a minimum of million us gallons per week 
the term of the water supply agreement will be extended at the date that the expansion is completed for a period of twenty years  or until the plant has delivered approximately billion us gallons of water  whichever occurs later 
cw bahamas liquidity as of december   cw bahamas was due approximately million from the wsc 
we have been informed previously by representatives of the bahamas government that the delay in paying our accounts receivables is due to operating issues within the wsc  that the delay does not reflect any type of dispute with us with respect to the amounts owed  and that the amounts will ultimately be paid in full 
based on our january meeting with officials of the bahamas government  we believe the bahamas government will make a payment in the near future to reduce cw bahamas receivable balances to approximately days outstanding 
as reported in an article included in the february  issue of the tribune  a bahamas newspaper  bahamian prime minister hubert ingraham communicated in his mid year budget address that million had been budgeted for wsc to defray arrears and future payments to the consolidated water company 
based upon these communications  we believe that the accounts receivable from the wsc are fully collectible and therefore have not provided any allowance for possible non payment of these receivables as of december transfers of us dollars from cw bahamas to our other subsidiaries require authorization in advance from the central bank of the bahamas 
cw bahamas performance bonds we have two contracts  one for our windsor plant and one for our blue hill plant  to supply water to the wsc 
each contract requires us to guarantee delivery of a minimum quantity of water per week 
if we do not meet this minimum  we are required to pay the wsc for the difference between the minimum and actual gallons delivered at a per gallon rate equal to the price per gallon that wsc is currently paying us under the contract 
the windsor and blue hill contracts expire in and  respectively and require us to deliver million imperial gallons and million imperial gallons  respectively  of water each week 
we are required to provide the wsc with performance and operating guarantees  in the form of bank issued letters of credit  to secure any payments we may be required to make under the minimum delivery requirements of these contracts 
on august   a performance bond with the royal bank of canada in nassau  bahamas in the amount of  for the windsor plant expired and was not subsequently replaced 
we expect to obtain performance bonds for the windsor and blue hill plants once cw bahamas has received payment of its delinquent accounts receivable from the wsc

impact of inflation under the terms of our cayman islands license and our water sales agreements in belize  bahamas and the british virgin islands  our water rates are automatically adjusted for inflation on an annual basis  subject to temporary exceptions 
we  therefore  believe that the impact of inflation on our gross profit  measured in consistent dollars  will not be material 
however  significant increases in items such as fuel and energy costs could create additional credit risks for us  as our customers ability to pay our invoices could be adversely affected by such increases 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk credit risk we are not exposed to significant credit risk on retail customer accounts in the cayman islands or in bimini  the bahamas  as our policy is to cease supply of water to customers whose accounts are more than days overdue 
our primary exposure to credit risk is from accounts receivable arising from bulk water sales to the governments of belize  the bahamas  the british virgin islands  and the cayman islands 
as of december   we had approximately million in loans receivable due from the water authority cayman and  in a loan receivable due from our affiliate oc bvi 
both of these loans were current as to scheduled principal and interest payments as of december interest rate risk we are not exposed to significant interest rate risk as the annual interest rates on our series a bonds and bonds are fixed at and  respectively 
foreign exchange risk all of the currencies in our operating areas other than the mexican peso have been fixed to the united states dollar for over years and we do not employ a hedging strategy against exchange rate risk associated with our reporting in united states dollars 
if any of these fixed exchange rates becomes a floating exchange rate our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected
