overview product portfolio we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on protecting and enhancing life by developing and manufacturing vaccines and antibody therapeutics that are supplied to healthcare providers and purchasers for use in preventing and treating disease 
for financial reporting purposes  we operate in two business segments  biodefense and biosciences 
our biodefense segment focuses on vaccines and antibody therapies for use against biological agents that are potential weapons of bioterrorism or biowarfare 
our products and product candidates in this segment are focused on anthrax 
we manufacture and market biothrax anthrax vaccine adsorbed  the only vaccine licensed by the us food and drug administration  or fda  for the prevention of anthrax infection 
in addition to biothrax  we are developing previthraxtm recombinant protective antigen anthrax vaccine  purified  anthrivigtm human anthrax immunoglobulin  thravixatm fully human anthrax monoclonal antibody  nuthraxtm anthrax vaccine absorbed with cpg adjuvant  and a double mutant recombinant protective antigen anthrax vaccine 
operations in this segment include biologics manufacturing  regulatory and quality affairs  marketing and sales in support of biothrax and a product development infrastructure in support of our investigational product candidates 
our biosciences segment is directed to commercial opportunities 
our programs in this segment target oncology  including b cell malignancies of chronic lymphocytic leukemia  or cll  and non hodgkin s lymphoma  or nhl  autoimmune and inflammatory disorders  or aiid  including rheumatoid arthritis  or ra  and systemic lupus erythematosus  or sle  and other infectious diseases such as tuberculosis  influenza and typhoid 
our programs in this segment include clinical and preclinical stage investigational product candidates 
operations in this segment include product development in support of our investigational product candidates  and manufacturing and related infrastructure initiatives in support of our technology platforms 
our biodefense segment has generated net income for each of the last five fiscal years 
over this timeframe  our biosciences segment has generated revenue through development contracts and grant funding  but none of our biosciences product candidates has received marketing approval and  therefore  our biosciences segment has not generated any product sales revenues 
as a result  our biosciences segment has incurred a net loss for each of the last five fiscal years 
product sales we have derived substantially all of our product sales revenues from biothrax sales to the us department of health and human services  or hhs  and the us department of defense  or dod  and expect for the foreseeable future to continue to derive substantially all of our product sales revenues from our sales of biothrax to the us government 
our total revenues from biothrax sales were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we are focused on increasing sales of biothrax to us government customers  expanding the market for biothrax to other customers domestically and internationally and pursuing label expansions and improvements for biothrax 
contracts and grants we seek to advance development of our product candidates through external funding arrangements 
we may slow down development programs or place them on hold during periods that are not covered by external funding 
we have received funding awards for the following development programs biothrax post exposure prophylaxis  nuthrax  large scale manufacturing for biothrax  previthrax  anthrivig  thravixa  double mutant recombinant protective antigen anthrax vaccine  recombinant botulinum vaccine  and typhella additionally  our tuberculosis vaccine product candidate is indirectly supported by grant funding provided to the university of oxford by the wellcome trust and aeras global tuberculosis vaccine foundation 
our tru product candidate is being funded via a joint collaboration with abbott laboratories  or abbott  in which we and abbott share all funding responsibilities equally 
our sbi product candidate is substantially funded by pfizer inc  or pfizer 
we continue to actively pursue additional government sponsored development contracts and grants and to encourage both governmental and non governmental agencies and philanthropic organizations to provide development funding or to conduct clinical studies of our product candidates 
manufacturing infrastructure we conduct our primary vaccine manufacturing operations at a multi building campus on approximately acres in lansing  michigan 
to augment our existing manufacturing capabilities  we have constructed building  a  square foot large scale manufacturing facility on our lansing campus 
in july  we entered into an agreement with the biomedical advanced research and development authority  or barda  to finalize development of and obtain regulatory approval for large scale manufacturing of biothrax in building this agreement provides for funding from barda of up to approximately million over a five year contract term  including a two year base period of performance valued at approximately million 
prior to the award  we incurred costs of approximately million for the building and associated capital equipment  as well as for validation and qualification activities required for regulatory approval and initiation of commercial manufacture of biothrax 
in november  we purchased a building in baltimore  maryland for product development and manufacturing purposes  and have begun renovation and improvement of this facility 
our specific plans for this facility will be contingent on the progress of our existing development programs and the outcome of our efforts to acquire new product candidates 
as we proceed with this project  we expect the costs to be substantial and will likely seek external sources of funds to finance the project 
we also own two buildings in frederick  maryland that we currently expect to sell 
accordingly  we have classified these buildings as assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets 
we recorded the assets held for sale at fair market value  based on factors that include recent purchase offers  less estimated selling costs  and recorded impairment charges of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we continue to actively seek to sell these buildings 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to accrued expenses  income taxes  stock based compensation  investments  in process research and development  goodwill and contingent value rights 
we based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from product sales if four basic criteria have been met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or title has passed to our customer based on contract terms  the fee is fixed and determinable and no further obligation exists  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have generated biothrax sales revenues under us government contracts with hhs and the dod 
under our current contract with hhs  we invoice hhs and recognize the related revenues upon acceptance by the government at the delivery site  at which time title to the product passes to hhs 
from time to time  we are awarded reimbursement contracts for services and development grant contracts with government entities and philanthropic organizations 
under these contracts  we typically are reimbursed for our costs as we perform specific development activities  and we may also be entitled to additional fees 
revenue on our reimbursable contracts is recognized as costs are incurred  generally based on the allowable costs incurred during the period  plus any recognizable earned fee 
the amounts that we receive under these contracts vary greatly from quarter to quarter  depending on the scope and nature of the work performed 
we record the reimbursement of our costs and any associated fees as contracts and grants revenue and the associated costs as research and development expense 
we also generate revenues from our collaborations with pfizer and abbott 
certain internal and external research and development costs and patent costs are reimbursed in connection with our collaboration agreements 
reimbursed costs under the pfizer collaboration are recognized as revenue in the period in which the costs are incurred 
our collaboration with abbott provides for equal cost sharing of development and clinical costs 
each quarter we and abbott report to the other party the total costs incurred for development costs 
the total spending by each party is then compared to the spending by the other party 
in the event that our spending for a given quarter exceeds the spending of abbott  we record a net receivable in our financial statements for the difference between our spending and of the total spending for the period  and recognize revenue equal to this amount 
if abbott s spending for the quarterly period exceeds our spending  we record a net payable in our financial statements equal to the difference between our spending and of the total spending  and record additional research and development expenses in this amount 
as a result  our revenues and research and development expenses may fluctuate depending on which party in the collaboration is incurring the majority of the development costs in any particular quarterly period 
contracts and grants revenues are subject to the estimation processes to the extent that the reimbursable costs underlying these revenues are incurred but not billed and agreed to on a timely basis  and are subject to change in future periods when actual costs are known 
to date we have not made material adjustments to these estimates 
we recognize revenues from the achievement of research and development milestones  if deemed substantive  when the milestones are achieved 
if not deemed substantive  we recognize revenue on a straight line basis over the remaining expected term of continued involvement in the research and development process 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using a standard cost method  which approximates average cost 
average cost consists primarily of material  labor and manufacturing overhead expenses and includes the services and products of third party suppliers 
we analyze our inventory levels quarterly and write down inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and inventory in excess of expected customer demand 
we also write off costs related to expired inventory 
we capitalize the costs associated with the manufacture of biothrax as inventory from the initiation of the manufacturing process through the completion of manufacturing  labeling and packaging 
income taxes under the asset and liability method of income tax accounting  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the tax rates and laws that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a net deferred tax asset or liability is reported on the balance sheet 
our deferred tax assets include the unamortized portion of in process research and development expenses  the anticipated future benefit of the net operating losses and other timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we have historically incurred net operating losses for income tax purposes in some states  primarily maryland  and in some foreign jurisdictions  primarily the united kingdom 
in connection with our october acquisition of trubion pharmaceuticals  inc  or trubion  we acquired significant federal net operating losses and research and development tax credits along with other tax attributes 
the amount of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet reflects our expectations regarding our ability to use our net operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards  including those acquired in our acquisition of trubion  to offset future taxable income 
the applicable tax rules in particular jurisdictions limit our ability to use net operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards as a result of ownership changes 
in particular  we believe that these rules will significantly limit our ability to use net operating losses generated by microscience limited  or microscience  and antex biologics  inc  or antex  prior to our acquisition of microscience in june and our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of antex in may we do not expect that these limitation rules will significantly limit the net operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards acquired in the trubion acquisition 
we review our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to assess our ability to realize the benefit from these deferred tax assets 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that the amount of our expected future taxable income will not be sufficient to allow us to fully utilize our deferred tax assets  we increase our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by recording a provision for income taxes on our income statement  which reduces net income or increases net loss for that period and reduces our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
if we determine that the amount of our expected future taxable income will allow us to utilize net operating losses in excess of our net deferred tax assets  we reduce our valuation allowance by recording a benefit from income taxes on our income statement  which increases net income or reduces net loss for that period and increases our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
uncertainty in income taxes is accounted for using a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
contingent value rights in accordance with the terms of our acquisition of trubion  in october  we have committed to make potential future contingent value right  or cvr  payments of up to million to former shareholders and stock option holders of trubion 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones has not occurred as of december   the obligation for these contingencies has been recorded in our financial statements at fair value 
the fair value model used for the cvr obligations is based on a discounted cash flow model that has been risk adjusted based on the probability of achievement of the milestones 
we re evaluate the fair value of the cvr obligations on a quarterly basis 
any future increase in the fair value of the cvr obligations  based on an increased likelihood that the underlying milestones will be achieved and the associated payment or payments will therefore become due and payable  will result in a charge to research and development expense in the period in which the increase is determined 
similarly  any future decrease in the fair value of the cvr obligation will result in a reduction in research and development expense 
acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  represents the fair value assigned to research and development assets that we acquire that have not been completed at the date of acquisition 
the value assigned to acquired ipr d is determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting revenue from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to present value 
the revenue and costs projections used to value acquired ipr d were  as applicable  reduced based on the probability of developing a new product 
additionally  the projections considered the relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects are based on management s estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes from such projects 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were commensurate with the stage of development of the projects and uncertainties in the economic estimates used in the projections described above 
we determine the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date using discounted cash flow models 
these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the ipr d assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date 
if these product candidates are not successfully developed  our sales and profitability will be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of the acquired ipr d assets may become impaired 
our annual assessment will include a comparison of the fair value of ipr d to our existing carrying value 
we will recognize an impairment for amounts greater than the determined fair value 
we believe that the assumptions used in valuing the ipr d are reasonable and are based upon our best estimate of likely outcomes of our clinical development 
the underlying assumptions and estimates used to value these ipr d assets are subject to change in the future  and actual results may differ significantly from the assumptions and estimates 
our ipr d assets are assessed on an annual basis for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
goodwill we assess the carrying value of goodwill annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable  to determine whether any impairment in this asset may exist and  if so  the extent of such impairment 
the provisions of the relevant accounting guidance require that we perform a two step impairment test 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of the reporting units 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting units  then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded and charged to general and administrative expense 
we calculate the fair value of the reporting units utilizing a weighting of the income and market approaches 
the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model  using a discount rate based on our estimated cost of capital 
the market approach utilizes revenue and other metrics from similar publicly traded companies 
the results of both fair value calculations are then compared to our reporting unit s carrying value 
we have selected october st an our annual impairment test date 
the acquisition of trubion occurred on october   therefore we performed an assessment to determine whether goodwill was more likely than not impaired at december   which would require an interim impairment 
we determined that no such indicators were present 
the determination of the fair value of our reporting units is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the estimates and assumptions used in calculating fair value include identifying future cash flows  which requires that we make a number of critical legal  economic  market and business assumptions that reflect our best estimates as of the testing date 
our assumptions and estimates may differ significantly from actual results  or circumstances could change that would cause us to conclude that an impairment exists or that we previously understated the extent of impairment review 
stock based compensation in accordance with stock based compensation accounting guidance  all equity awards to employees  including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock units  are recognized in the income statement based on their estimated grant date fair values 
we determine the grant date fair value of restricted stock units using the closing market price of our common stock on the day prior to the date of grant 
we utilize the black scholes valuation model for estimating the grant date fair value of all stock options granted 
we measure the amount of compensation cost based on the fair value of the underlying equity award on the date of grant 
we recognize compensation cost over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
the effect of this accounting treatment on net income attributable to emergent biosolutions inc and earnings per share in any period is not necessarily representative of the effects in future years due to  among other things  the vesting period of the equity awards and the fair value of additional equity awards granted in future years 
financial operations overview revenues on september   we entered into an agreement with hhs to supply up to million doses of biothrax for placement into the strategic national stockpile  or sns 
this agreement was amended in july to  among other things  allow us to accelerate the delivery of biothrax doses into the sns by approximately three months 
the term of the agreement is from september  through september  delivery of doses under the agreement commenced in september and are scheduled through june funds for the procurement of these doses of biothrax have been fully committed 
the total purchase price for the million doses is approximately million 
through december   we have delivered approximately million doses under this agreement 
we have agreed to provide all shipping services related to delivery of doses into the sns over the term of the agreement  for which hhs has agreed to pay us approximately million 
we invoice under the agreement upon acceptance of each delivery of biothrax doses to the sns 
we have received contract and grant funding from national institute of allergy and infectious diseases  or niaid  and barda for the following development programs product candidate manufacturing funding source award date amount up to performance period anthrivig niaid million recombinant botulinum vaccine niaid million nuthrax niaid million thravixa niaid barda million nuthrax niaid barda million double mutant recombinant protective antigen anthrax vaccine niaid million large scale manufacturing for biothrax barda million nuthrax niaid million previthrax barda million our revenue  operating results and profitability have varied  and we expect that they will continue to vary on a quarterly basis  primarily because of the timing of our fulfilling orders for biothrax and work done under new and existing contracts and grants 
cost of product sales the primary expense that we incur to deliver biothrax to our customers is manufacturing costs  which are primarily fixed costs 
these fixed manufacturing costs consist of facilities  utilities and salaries and personnel related expenses for indirect manufacturing support staff 
variable manufacturing costs for biothrax consist primarily of costs for materials  direct labor and contract filling operations 
we determine the cost of product sales for doses sold during a reporting period based on the average manufacturing cost per dose in the period those doses were manufactured 
we calculate the average manufacturing cost per dose in the period of manufacture by dividing the actual costs of manufacturing in such period by the number of units produced in that period 
in addition to the fixed and variable manufacturing costs described above  the average manufacturing cost per dose depends on the efficiency of the manufacturing process  utilization of available manufacturing capacity and the production yield for the period of production 
research and development expenses we expense research and development costs as incurred 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees to professional service providers for  among other things  preclinical and analytical testing  independently monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data from our clinical trials and non clinical studies  costs of contract manufacturing services for clinical trial material  costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development  depreciation of capital assets used to develop our products  and operating costs  such as the operating costs of facilities and the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to be in a position to realize the potential of our product candidates 
we expect that spending for our product pipeline will increase as our product development activities continue based on ongoing advancement of our product candidates  including those recently acquired through our acquisition of trubion  and as we prepare for regulatory submissions and other regulatory activities 
we expect that the magnitude of any increase in our research and development spending will be dependent upon such factors as the results from our ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials  continued participation of our third party collaborators  the size  structure and duration of any follow on clinical programs that we may initiate  costs associated with manufacturing our product candidates on a large scale basis for later stage clinical trials  and our ability to use or rely on data generated by government agencies  such as studies with biothrax conducted by the centers for disease control and prevention  or cdc 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving the executive  sales and marketing  business development  finance  accounting  information technology  legal and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in cost of product sales or research and development expense and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
we currently market and sell biothrax directly to the us government with a small  targeted marketing and sales group 
as we seek to broaden the market for biothrax and if we receive marketing approval for additional products  we expect that we will increase our spending for marketing and sales activities 
total other income expense total other income expense consists primarily of interest income and interest expense  and in  a charge to reduce previously accrued interest income related to a settlement agreement with protein sciences corporation  or psc 
we earn interest income on our cash  cash equivalents and a note receivable  and we incur interest expense on our indebtedness 
we capitalize interest expense based on the cost of major ongoing projects which have not yet been placed in service  such as new manufacturing facilities 
some of our existing debt arrangements provide for increasing amortization of principal payments in future periods 
see liquidity and capital resources debt financing for additional information 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues product sales revenues increased by million  or  to million for from million for this increase in product sales revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of doses of biothrax delivered

product sales revenues in consisted of biothrax sales to hhs of million and aggregate international and other sales of  contracts and grant revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in contracts and grants revenue was primarily due to revenues from our recently awarded large scale manufacturing for biothrax contract and our collaboration with abbott and pfizer along with increased activity and associated revenue from our development contracts with niaid and barda for nuthrax  previthrax  and our double mutant recombinant protective antigen anthrax vaccine 
contracts and grants revenue for primarily consisted of million from niaid and barda  million from abbott and pfizer  million related to the us government s therapeutic discovery project program and  from a milestone payment related to the sale of technology rights and related materials to our pertussis technology 
contracts and grants revenues for consisted of million in development contract revenue from niaid and barda and  from sanofi pasteur under a collaboration agreement that was terminated in december cost of product sales cost of product sales increased by  or  to million for from million for this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of biothrax doses sold  substantially offset by a decrease in cost per dose sold associated with increased production yield in the period during which the doses sold were produced 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million for from million for this increase primarily reflects higher contract service and personnel costs  and includes increased expenses of million on product candidates that are categorized in the biodefense segment  increased expenses of million on product candidates and technology platform development activities categorized in the biosciences segment  and increased expenses of  in other research and development  which are in support of central research and development activities 
the increase in spending on biodefense product candidates  detailed in the table below  was primarily attributable to the timing of development efforts on various programs as we completed various studies and prepared for subsequent studies and trials 
the increase in spending for our nuthrax program was due to the conduct of stability and clinical studies along with potency assay development 
the increase in spending for our large scale manufacturing for biothrax program was primarily due to characterization assay and process development that increased subsequent to the associated development contract award in july the decrease in spending for biothrax related programs was related to timing of clinical and non clinical studies to support applications for marketing approval of these programs 
the decrease in spending for our previthrax product candidate was primarily due to reduced spending while awaiting a development contract award from barda  which we received in september the increase in spending for our double mutant recombinant protective antigen anthrax vaccine product candidate resulted from spending for process manufacturing and assay development 
the spending for our anthrivig product candidate was primarily for clinical studies  model development and regulatory activities 
the spending for our thravixa product candidate was primarily due to process and formulation development along with safety studies 
the spending for our botulinum vaccine product candidates resulted from conducting non clinical studies 
we expect that spending for our botulinum vaccine candidates will remain minimal in the future  due primarily to reduced funding by the us government for these product candidates 
the increase in spending on biosciences product candidates  detailed in the table below  was primarily attributable to the timing of development efforts partially offset by the termination or scaling back of certain programs 
the increase in spending for our tuberculosis vaccine product candidate is related to the costs incurred for the continued conduct of a phase iib clinical trial  which commenced in april the decrease in spending for typhella was primarily due to the timing of stability and clinical studies 
the increase in spending for our influenza vaccine product candidate is related to process and analytical development 
the increase in spending for our tru and sbi product candidates  primarily for clinical studies and manufacturing costs  is due to our october acquisition of trubion and its development programs for product candidates to treat certain autoimmune diseases and cancer  including ra  sle  cll and nhl 
the decrease in spending for our hepatitis b therapeutic vaccine product candidate was related to the cessation of the phase ii clinical trial in the united kingdom and serbia 
we have significantly reduced ongoing spending with regard to this product candidate while we investigate options to sell or outlicense the related technology  and expect that future spending will be reduced 
the increase in spending for our other biosciences activities was due to increased spending associated with development of platform technologies along with preclinical product candidates that we acquired in the acquisition of trubion 
the spending for other research and development activities was primarily attributable to central research and development activities

the increase in spending on biodefense product candidates  detailed in the table below  was primarily attributable to the timing of development efforts on various programs as we completed various studies and prepared for subsequent studies and trials  coupled with increased spending on product candidates that we acquired in the increase in spending for biothrax related programs was due to the preparation for and conduct of clinical and non clinical feasibility  efficacy and stability studies to support applications for marketing approval of these programs  along with formulation development and manufacture of clinical material 
the increase in spending for our previthrax product candidate was related primarily to costs incurred to respond to a request for proposal from barda and the continued advancement of the product candidate 
the decrease in spending for our double mutant protective antigen vaccine resulted from the timing of feasibility and stability studies 
the increase in spending for our anthrivig candidate was primarily due to the commencement of clinical and non clinical studies during the increase in spending for the thravixa candidate was primarily for manufacture of a working cell bank  formulation development and the conduct of non clinical studies 
the increase in spending for our botulinum vaccine product candidates resulted from conducting non clinical studies and the manufacture of master and working cell banks 
the decrease in spending on biosciences product candidates  detailed in the table below  was primarily attributable to the timing of development efforts and to the termination or scaling back of certain programs 
the increase in spending for our tuberculosis vaccine product candidate is related to the formation of our joint venture with the university of oxford in july  the procurement of licenses  and preparation for and conduct of a phase iib clinical trial  which commenced in april the spending for typhella in resulted from the manufacture of clinical material and conducting a phase iib clinical trial in the united states

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december payments due by period in thousands total after contractual obligations long term indebtedness including current portion operating lease obligations total contractual obligations there are a number of uncertainties that we face in the development of new product candidates that prevent us from making a reasonable estimate of the cash obligations under our material license and collaboration agreements 
because of these uncertainties  the preceding table excludes contingent contractual payments that we may become obligated to make under such agreements 
these agreements typically provide for the payment of milestone fees upon achievement of specified research  development and commercialization milestones  such as the commencement of clinical trials  the receipt of funding awards  the receipt of regulatory approvals  and the achievement of sales milestones 
the amount of contingent contractual milestone payments that we may become obligated to make is variable based on the actual achievement and timing of the applicable milestones and the characteristics of any products or product candidates that are developed  including factors such as number of products or product candidates developed  type and number of components of each product or product candidate  ownership of the various components and the specific markets affected  and the aggregate payments could be as much as approximately million 
the success of our efforts to commercialize our product candidates depends on many factors  including those set forth in risk factors our business depends significantly on our success in completing development and commercialization of our product candidates at acceptable costs  and is highly uncertain 
even if these efforts are successful  the timing of success is highly unpredictable and variable 
the same is true for any contingent contractual royalty payments that we may be obligated to make upon successful commercialization of these product candidates 
we do not expect that any such payments would have an adverse effect on our financial position  operations and capital resources because  if payable  we expect that the benefits associated with the achievement of the relevant milestones or the achievement of revenue would offset the burden of making these payments 
we are not obligated to pay any minimum royalties under our existing contracts 
debt financing as of december   we had million principal amount of debt outstanding  comprised primarily of the following million outstanding under a loan from the department of business and economic development of the state of maryland used to finance eligible costs incurred to purchase our first facility in frederick  maryland  million outstanding under a mortgage loan from pnc bank used to finance the remaining portion of the purchase price for our first frederick facility  million outstanding under a mortgage loan from hsbc realty credit corporation used to finance a portion of the purchase price for our second facility on the frederick site  million outstanding under a term loan from hsbc realty credit corporation used to finance a portion of the costs of our facility expansion in lansing  michigan  million outstanding under a mortgage loan from hsbc realty credit corporation used to finance a portion of the purchase price of our facility in baltimore  maryland  and million outstanding under a mortgage loan from hsbc realty credit corporation used to finance a portion of the purchase price of our facility in gaithersburg  maryland 
some of our debt instruments contain financial and operating covenants 
in particular under our loan from the state of maryland  we are not required to repay the principal amount of the loan if beginning december  and through we maintain a specified number of employees at the frederick site  by december  we have invested at least million in total funds toward financing the purchase of the buildings on the site and for related improvements and operation of the facility  and we occupy the facility through our plans for this facility have changed  and we currently plan to sell both frederick buildings 
as such we have not met the requirements for the loan to be forgivable as of december  we have reached an agreement with the state of maryland to repay the loan in full by march   with an earlier repayment due upon sale of the building

the facilities  software and other equipment that we purchased with the proceeds of our loans from pnc bank  the state of maryland and hsbc realty credit corporation serve as collateral for these loans 
our line of credit with fifth third bank is secured by accounts receivable under our hhs contracts 
our term loan with hsbc realty credit corporation is secured by substantially all of emergent biodefense operations assets  other than accounts receivable under our hhs contracts 
the covenants under our existing debt instruments and the pledge of our existing assets as collateral limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing

tax benefits in connection with our facility expansion in lansing  the state of michigan and the city of lansing have provided us a variety of tax credits and abatements 
we estimate that the total value of these tax benefits may be up to million over a period of up to years  beginning in these tax benefits are primarily based on our investment in our lansing facility 
in addition  we must maintain a specified number of employees in lansing to continue to qualify for these tax benefits 
funding requirements we expect to continue to fund our anticipated operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt service requirements from existing cash and cash equivalents  revenues from biothrax product sales  collaboration funding  development contract and grant funding  and our existing line of credit 
there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biothrax product sales and with the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
we may seek additional external debt financing to provide additional financial flexibility 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the level and timing of biothrax product sales and cost of product sales  our ability to obtain funding from government entities and non government and philanthropic organizations for our development programs  the level of participation of collaborative partners in our development programs  including those recently acquired in our acquisition of trubion  the acquisition of new facilities  and capital improvements to new or existing facilities  the timing of  and the costs involved in  completion of qualification and validation activities related to building  our large scale manufacturing facility in lansing  michigan  the build out of our new manufacturing facility in baltimore  maryland  and any other new facilities  the scope  progress  results and costs of our preclinical and clinical development activities  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates  the number of  and development requirements for  other product candidates that we may pursue  the costs of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the market acceptance and sales growth of any of our products and product candidates upon regulatory approval  the extent to which growth generates increased administrative costs  the extent to which we lend money to  and are able to obtain repayment from  third parties  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and the results of such litigation  the extent to which we acquire or invest in companies  businesses  products and technologies  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the extent to which we become obligated to make cash payments related to the contingent value rights issued to former holders of trubion common stock in connection with our acquisition of trubion that are not offset by corresponding cash inflows from our collaborative partners 
we may require additional sources of funds for future acquisitions that we may make or  depending on the size of the obligation  to meet balloon payments upon maturity of our current borrowings 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
current economic conditions may make it difficult to obtain financing on attractive terms or at all 
lenders may be able to impose covenants on us that could be difficult to satisfy  which could put us at increased risk of defaulting on debt 
if financing is unavailable or lost  we could be forced to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs or reduce our planned commercialization efforts 
our ability to borrow additional amounts under our revolving line of credit agreement is subject to our satisfaction of specified conditions 
additional equity or debt financing  grants  or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends 
any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms  such as liquidation and other preferences that are not favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties  it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us 
effects of inflation our most liquid assets are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
we also believe that we have intangible assets in the value of our intellectual property 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we have not capitalized the value of this intellectual property on our balance sheet 
due to the nature of this intellectual property  we believe that these intangible assets are not affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash that have maturities of less than three months  our investments  and our long term indebtedness 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure or interest on foreign currency exchange exposure  and the movement of foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse or positive impact on our results of operations 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
because of the short term maturities of our cash and cash equivalents and the small amount of our non cash investments of million as of december   we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have a significant impact on the realized value of our investments  but would likely increase the interest expense associated with our debt
