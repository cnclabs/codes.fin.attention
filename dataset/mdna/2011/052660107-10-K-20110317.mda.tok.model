item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation this section should be read in conjunction with cautionary statements and risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k and consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading provider of security and identity management solutions for pc  wireless device and information technology it markets 
we provide a series of products including fingerprint sensors  software and security hardware and software that provide security  convenience  personalization and navigation features in pcs  cell phones  printers  network servers and many other end products 
we continue to evolve from a mixed signal semiconductor component supplier focused primarily on fingerprint authentication sensor to a provider of complete solutions focused on a wide array of security and identity management solutions 
our product portfolio has significantly expanded during the past two years  and now includes smart fingerprint sensors  area sensors  fingerprint sensor chipsets and modules  usb fingerprint readers  identity management software and embedded security ip products and services 
our expansion has been driven by both internal product development efforts and strategic acquisitions 
in february  we acquired safenet s embedded security solutions division  further enhancing our offering of security and identity management solutions 
the embedded security solutions products are used in communication and network products to ensure data privacy and content protection for businesses and individuals 
with the addition of the embedded security solutions expertise in software development  network security and secure communication  we have the ability to offer secure end to end solutions  from the individual pc or cell phone all the way to the network server in the cloud 
in september  we acquired privately held upek inc  a leading supplier of fingerprint solutions for consumer  business and government applications 
we believe the combined company will benefit from authentec s leadership position in the pc and wireless markets as well as in embedded security  and from upek s software expertise  presence in the pc and wireless markets and leadership in silicon based biometrics for government and id 
in we shipped million sensor units as compared to million sensor units shipped in as the weak economy negatively affected customer demand for certain end products that our sensors were incorporated into 
correspondingly  our sensor revenues decreased to million in as compared to million in due to our acquisition of upek  we were able to reduce the negative impact on our sensor revenue and also recognize additional revenue of million from licensing and royalties in  as a result of the acquisition of safenet s embedded security solutions division 
we primarily sell our products to oems  odms  contract manufacturers  software application vendors  and service providers 
our customers products are complex and require significant time to define  design and ramp to volume production 
our sales cycle begins with our selling and marketing staff and application engineers engaging with our customers system designers and management  which is typically a multi month  or even multi year  process 
if we are successful  a customer will decide to incorporate our solution in its product  which we refer to as a design win 
there is no assurance that a design win will make it to full production as the product we are designed into could be cancelled for any number of reasons by the customer 
because the sales cycles for our products are long  we incur expenses to develop and sell our products  regardless of whether we achieve the design win and well in advance of generating revenue  if any  from those expenditures 
we do not have long term purchase commitments from any of our customers  as sales of our products are generally made under individual purchase orders 
however  once one of our products is incorporated into a customer s design  it is likely to remain designed in for the life cycle of that specific product 
we believe this to be the case because a redesign of a product already in production would generally be time consuming and expensive 
we do not own or operate our own semiconductor fabrication  wafer bumping  assembly or test facilities 
we depend on independent vendors to manufacture  assemble and test our fingerprint sensor products 
by outsourcing manufacturing  we are able to avoid the cost associated with owning and operating our own manufacturing facility and can take advantage of the scale of operations these third parties provide 
challenges and risks our future profitability and rate of growth  if any  will be directly affected by the continued acceptance of our products in the marketplace  as well as the timing and size of orders  product mix  average selling prices and costs of our products  timely introduction of new products  generation of ip license fees and royalties  as well as general economic conditions 
our ability to achieve profitability will also be affected by the extent to which we must incur additional expenses to expand our sales  marketing  development  and general and administrative capabilities to expand our business 
the largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs 
personnel costs consist of salaries  benefits and incentive compensation  including bonuses and stock based compensation  for our employees 
the following are material trends that are creating opportunities and risks to our business  and a discussion of how we are responding 
the global macroeconomic downturn accelerated the growth in sales of consumer pcs  including tablets 
the fingerprint sensor attach rate in lower cost pcs is lower relative to more expensive  feature rich models 
to increase penetration of the lower cost pc market  we are focusing development efforts on lower cost fingerprint sensors and client application software tailored for use in this growing portion of the pc market 
we introduced a small  lower cost fingerprint sensor for the pc market  the aes and our truesuite identity management software  in these new solutions are tailored for consumer pcs and the growing portion of the lower cost laptop market 
our revenue in the pc market declined in due to the effect of certain design losses in our smart sensor solutions segment 
we expect the incremental revenues from the upek acquisition to somewhat offset this decline in the future 
outside of japan  wireless network carriers are still evaluating the value proposition of integrating fingerprint sensors into wireless and other handheld devices sold for use on their networks 
we expect eventual widespread integration of fingerprint sensors into wireless devices  however  the timing of adoption by wireless network carriers  if at all  will have a significant impact on our future revenues 
in response  we are working with wireless device manufacturers to accelerate adoption of fingerprint sensors by highlighting features such as personalization and navigation as well as our application software 
we are starting to see results of our efforts and we are focused on improving the durability and aesthetics of our sensors for wireless devices through continued development of our new touchstone packaging technology 
in february  we introduced the aes  first smart sensor for the mobile systems market  which takes full advantage of authentec s new touchstone packaging technology 
in october  we introduced our aes  the smallest sensor we have developed to date  combining both advanced navigation with biometrically enabled touch based features  as a cost competitive alternative to navigation only devices in mobile phones 
weak macroeconomic conditions continued impacting customer demand in  resulting in a sequential decline in revenue and a net loss  as compared to fiscal we have and continue to take actions to reduce our expenses to minimize losses and  as a result of our acquisition of upek  we believe we will be able to achieve greater cost savings in the future 
description of our revenue  cost of revenue and expenses revenue 
our revenue is generated primarily from shipments of our smart fingerprint sensors  software and technology licenses  royalties  maintenance post contract customer support  and development arrangements and services 
the price of our products is based upon market and competitive conditions 
therefore  the main factors that impact our revenue are unit volumes  ip license fees and average selling prices 
we supply our products to several end customers either directly or through their suppliers  which may be odms  contract manufacturers or distributors 
distributors are used primarily to support logistics  including credit management and importation outside the us the majority of our revenue is denominated in us dollar  however we do generate revenue that is denominated in other currencies  mostly euro and japanese yen 
cost of revenue and gross margin 
we outsource all manufacturing activities associated with our fingerprint sensor products  which includes wafer fabrication  wafer bumping  assembly and test functions 
a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of the costs to manufacture our products 
cost of revenue also includes items such as technical support for licensed software and security hardware and software  equipment depreciation  royalty expense  production planning personnel and related expenses  warranty costs  inventory valuation write downs  amortization of acquired intangible assets and stock based compensation under asc topic  compensation stock compensation and asc subtopic  equity based payments to non employees 
the primary factors that impact our cost of revenue are the number of units sold  mix of products sold  wafer and other raw material costs  outsourced manufacturing costs and product yields 
in the future  we believe cost of revenue could increase in absolute dollars from an expected increase in revenue or could decline in absolute dollars from a decrease in revenue 
cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue in the smart sensor solutions segment may increase over time if decreases in average selling prices are not offset by corresponding decreases in our product costs 
our cost of revenue in the smart sensor solutions segment may increase as a result of amortization of acquired intangible assets which may increase our cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue 
cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue in the embedded solutions segment is expected to be relatively low due to the nature of licensing products 
we use third party foundries  bumping  assembly and test subcontractors  which are primarily located in asia  to manufacture our semiconductor products 
we purchase processed wafers from our fabrication suppliers  which are currently taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited  global foundries singapore pte ltd  and st microelectronics 
we also outsource the bumping  assembly  test and other processing of our products to third party subcontractors  primarily chipbond technology corporation  signetics corporation  isa micro electronics  and amkor technology 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our third party subcontractors 
a significant disruption in the operations of one or more of these subcontractors would impact the production of our products and could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including average selling prices of our products  product mix  and timing of cost reductions for outsourced manufacturing services  inventory write downs and the timing and changes in production yields 
in addition  we tend to experience lower yields on the initial production release of a new product 
following the acquisition of safenet s embedded security solutions division  our margins will be subject to fluctuation due to the mix of revenue between our operating segments as a result of the substantially higher margin products in the embedded security solutions segment 
our gross margins in the smart sensor solutions segment may decrease as a result of the upek acquisition as they have historically experienced lower gross margins 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses primarily include personnel  the cost of fabrication masks  engineering development software  depreciation and amortization associated with capital equipment and intellectual property  third party development support  allocated facilities expense  and stock based compensation under asc topic  compensation stock compensation and asc subtopic  equity based payments to non employees 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we believe that research and development expenses may increase in absolute dollars in fiscal as we obtained new engineering team in the embedded security solutions segment as a result of the safenet acquisition and in the smart sensor solutions segment as a result of the upek acquisition 
additionally  as a percentage of revenue  these costs fluctuate from one period to another 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for our sales and marketing personnel  independent sales representative commissions  travel  marketing communications  press releases  advertising  costs for tradeshows  marketing programs  allocated facilities expense  consultants and market studies  amortization of acquired intangible assets and stock based compensation under asc topic  compensation stock compensation and asc subtopic  equity based payments to non employees 
as we align our operating expenses with current economic conditions  we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal as a result of the safenet and upek acquisitions 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of general corporate costs  including personnel expenses  financial reporting  corporate governance and compliance and outside legal  audit  tax compliance fees  allocated facilities expense  and stock based compensation under asc topic  compensation stock compensation and asc subtopic  equity based payments to non employees 
our general and administrative expenses fluctuate from one period to another due to costs associated with mergers and acquisitions as well as litigation related costs 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease in fiscal year as a result of decreases in legal and acquisition related costs 
litigation dismissal 
the litigation dismissal expenses reflect estimated effective settlement charges of the patent lawsuits with upek  inc and atrua  llc that would have been incurred if the claims were not dismissed as a result of our acquisitions of these two companies 
we do not expect to incur this type of litigation charges on a continuous basis 
restructuring and impairment related charges 
restructuring charges reflect costs incurred as a result of restructuring activities and consist primarily of one time employee termination benefits  accounted under asc topic  exit or disposal cost obligations  impairment of long lived assets  accounted under asc topic  property  plant and equipment  and other costs related to the restructuring activities such as legal and travel expenses 
other income expense net 
other income expense net includes interest income earned on our short term and long term investments and cash and cash equivalents  realized and other than temporary unrealized losses on our available for sale investments  foreign currency related adjustments and the earn out adjustment arising from the change in contingent consideration associated with business acquisitions 
provision for income taxes 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million 
these federal net operating loss carry forwards will expire commencing in we also had million in foreign net operating loss carry forwards which will begin to expire in the year utilization of these net operating loss carry forwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  that are applicable if we have experienced an ownership change in the past or if an ownership change occurs in the future aggregated with certain other sales of our stock after our initial public offering 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  the disclosure of contingencies as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the periods represented 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies because they are important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgment and estimates about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition  inventory valuation  fair value measurements  goodwill and intangible assets  litigation related expenses  stock based compensation  product warranty  and accounting for income taxes 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
see risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report for certain matters that may affect our future financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue principally from products sales  software and technology licenses  royalties  maintenance post contract customer support  and development arrangements and services 
software and technology licenses sales are accounted for in accordance with asc revenue recognition software 
these sales typically contain multiple elements  including the license  maintenance and or other services 
for arrangements that include multiple elements  the fee is allocated to the various elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of each deliverable regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element 
vsoe of fair value for each element is established based on the sales price we charge when the same element is sold separately 
if vsoe does not exist for all delivered elements  but vsoe exists for the undelivered elements  we apply the residual method  provided that i all other applicable revenue recognition criteria are met  and ii the fair value of all of the undelivered elements is less than the arrangement fee 
under the residual method  the arrangement fee is recognized as follows i the total fair value of the undelivered elements  as indicated by vsoe  is deferred  and ii the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
generally  in our software and software related arrangements  we have established vsoe for maintenance and therefore recognize revenue under these arrangements using the residual method when the only remaining undelivered element is maintenance 
if vsoe of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered element of an arrangement  when the undelivered element is support  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized ratably over the period that the support is delivered 
revenues for support services are recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term  which is typically one year 
we recognize product revenue when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii our price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment 
however  we do not recognize revenue when any significant obligations remain 
customer purchase orders and or contracts are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents are used to verify product delivery 
we assess whether a price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess the collectability of our accounts receivable based primarily upon the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
in arrangements that include a combination of semiconductor products and software  where software is considered more than incidental and essential to the functionality of the product being sold  we account for the entire arrangement as a sale of software and software related items and allocate the arrangement consideration based on vsoe 
for our royalty revenue we rely on data provided by the licensee 
we earn royalties on such licensed products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that the licensees sales occur 
our licensees  however  do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter 
we recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter and when other revenue recognition criteria are met 
certain of our smart sensor sales are made to distributors under agreements providing for price protection and limited right of return on unsold merchandise 
revenue and cost relating to distributor sales are deferred until the product is sold by the distributor 
related revenue and costs are then reflected in income based on sales reported by distributors 
inventory valuation 
inventory  consisting principally of outsourced semiconductor products  is valued at the lower of cost or market 
we utilize a standard costing application which approximates the first in  first out method 
we evaluate inventory for excess and obsolescence and write down units that are unlikely to be sold based upon a twelve month demand forecast 
this evaluation takes into account various matters including expected demand  product obsolescence and other factors 
if actual future demand for our products is less than currently forecasted  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or scrapped 
if a unit that has been written down or off is subsequently sold  the cost associated with the revenue from this unit is reduced to the extent of the write down  resulting in an increase in gross profit 
fair value measurements 
effective december   we adopted asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  which defines fair value  provides a consistent framework for measuring fair value under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and expands fair value financial statement disclosure requirements 
asc does not require any new fair value measurements 
it only applies to accounting pronouncements that already require or permit fair value measures  except for standards that relate to share based payments asc  compensation stock compensation  asc topic  leases  and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under asc we determine the fair value of our available for sale securities using the criteria of asc this accounting standard  among other things  defines fair value  establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis 
asc clarifies that fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as a basis for considering such assumptions  asc establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level inputs  other than the quoted prices in active markets  that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions 
we estimate the fair value of our auction rate securities based on the following i the underlying structure of each security  ii the present value of future principal and interest payments discounted at rates considered to reflect current market conditions  iii consideration of the probabilities of default  passing a future auction  or repurchase at par for each period  and iv estimates of the liquidity risk for each security 
these estimated fair values could change significantly based on future market conditions 
we review declines in the fair value of our investments in marketable securities in accordance with asc to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
unrealized losses are recognized in our consolidated statement of operations when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
we review our investments on an ongoing basis for indications of possible impairment  and if impairment is identified  we determine whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary 
determination of whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary requires significant judgment 
the primary factors that we consider in classifying the impairment include the extent and period of time the fair value of each investment has declined below its cost basis  the expected holding or recovery period for each investment  and our intent and ability to hold each investment until recovery 
refer to liquidity and capital resources in this section and note fair value measurements and disclosures of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further discussion of our investments in marketable securities 
our long lived assets excluding goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
we assess current usage  estimated remaining useful life  and consider other general factors impacting value of these assets 
if an indication of impairment is present  we compare the estimated discounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset or the asset group to its carrying amount 
if the discounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset or the asset group  we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value 
any write downs are treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the assets 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we categorize our intangible assets between goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate considerations paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets 
the value of potential intangible assets separate from goodwill are evaluated and assigned to the respective categories 
certain estimates and assumptions are used in applying these methodologies including projected sales  which include incremental revenue to be generated from the product markets that we have not been previously exposed to  disclosed future contracts and adjustments for declines in existing core sales  ongoing market demand for the relevant products  and required returns on tangible and intangible assets 
in the event that actual results or market conditions deviate from these estimates and assumptions used  the future fair value may be different than that determined by management and may result in an impairment loss 
goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not amortized 
intangible assets that have a definite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful life 
on an annual basis  or more frequently as needed upon certain indicators  we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
to determine the fair value of these intangible assets  there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing 
determining whether impairment of indefinite lived intangibles has occurred requires an analysis of each identifiable asset 
if estimates used in the valuation of each identifiable asset proved to be inaccurate based on future results  there could beimpairment charges in subsequent periods 
product warranty 
we offer a one year product replacement warranty 
in general  our standard policy is to either credit or replace the defective units 
we accrue for estimated returns of defective products based on historical activity for the prior twelve months at the time revenue is recognized as well as for specific known product issues 
the determination of these accruals requires us to make estimates of the frequency and extent of warranty activity and estimate future costs to replace the products under warranty 
if the actual warranty activity and or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from these estimates  adjustments to recognize additional cost of revenue may be required in future periods 
litigation related expenses 
we accrue litigation related legal expenses if these costs are reasonably estimable  regardless of whether a liability can be estimated for the loss contingency  itself 
if actual and forecasted legal expenses differ from these estimates  adjustments to this account may be required in future periods 
stock based compensation 
we measure compensation expense for all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest 
we determine the fair value of our stock options using the black scholes valuation model 
restricted stock awards are measured based on the fair values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant and expensed over the corresponding vesting period 
the application of the black scholes model to the valuation of options requires the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected term  expected dividend yield and expected risk free interest rate 
expected volatilities are based on those of similar publicly traded companies as well as our own 
the expected term represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules 
the dividend yield was zero based on our history of not paying dividends and the low resultant future expectation of dividend payments  and the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the option 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of asc topic  income taxes 
in applying asc  we are required to estimate our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
as of december   our total deferred tax assets were principally comprised of net operating loss carry forwards 
we account for uncertain tax positions using a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision

our consolidated revenue was million in as compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the million in revenues from our embedded security solutions segment as a result of the acquisition of safenet s embedded security solutions  or ess  division  as well as million of incremental revenues in our smart sensor solutions segment due to the upek acquisition completed during the year 
the incremental revenues from the aforementioned acquisitions were somewhat offset by the decline in shipments of our sensors to the pc market due to consumer demand for low end laptop models at lower prices that do not incorporate our fingerprint sensors 
we are seeing growth in the wireless market which is being driven by the demand for smartphones  tablet computers and other emerging portable devices 
our embedded security solutions revenue consists primarily of technology licenses  royalty revenue  support and maintenance as well as shipments of integrated circuit chips 
while embedded security solutions added million in revenue for the year ended december   our revenue in smart sensor solutions segment declined by of million  or as compared to the last fiscal last year 
following is an analysis of revenue by reportable segment fiscal year ended december  january  january  in thousands smart sensor solutions embedded security solutions consolidated cost of revenue and gross margin 
our cost of revenue was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended january   resulting in a gross profit of million in as compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
consolidated gross margin was in as compared to in the increase in cost of revenue  gross profit and gross margin is primarily attributable to our acquisitions of safenet s embedded security solutions division and upek 
the smart sensor solutions segment gross margin was for the year ended december  as compared to in the prior year 
the decline in gross margin was primarily attributed to lower margin of upek products as well as additional costs recorded in the third quarter of associated with purchase accounting driven step up inventory costs and amortization of purchased intangible assets 
the decline in gross margin was also driven by product mix and product variances 
overall average selling prices asp declined by five percent in contrast to the prior year 
embedded security solutions segment gross margin was for the year ended december  the higher profit margin in this segment is primarily due to revenue from software licensing fees and royalties that contain no or minimal product costs 
cost of goods in the embedded security solutions segment is mostly comprised of the manufacturing costs associated with the integrated circuit chips  amortization expense as a result of acquired amortizable intangible assets and technical support costs 
depending on the revenue partition between hardware and software  profit margin may vary between periods 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in as compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
research and development expenses were and of revenue for and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to the increased research and development expenses as a result of the acquisition of the embedded security solutions segment and upek 
research and development expenses in the smart sensor solutions segment increased by million mostly due to research and developments costs attributable to upek business that consisted mainly of labor related costs  amortization of purchased intangible assets and rent expense  and amounted to million 
this increase was partially offset by lower direct material costs of million as a result of timing of wafer mask set purchases 
research and development expenses associated with embedded security solutions segment were million for the year and consisted predominantly of engineering labor and related personnel costs as well as depreciation of internally developed software acquired in that business 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses were million in in contrast to million in  an increase of million  or 
selling and marketing expenses were and of revenue for years ended december  and january   respectively 
the selling and marketing expenses for smart sensor solutions segment increased by million primarily due to an increase of incremental upek costs of million related to the acquisition and consisted primarily of labor costs  amortization of purchased intangible assets  facilities costs and travel expenses 
unrelated to the upek acquisition  personnel related expenses increased by million  offset by a decrease in commissions of million as a result of lower smart sensor solutions revenue 
the selling and marketing expenses for the embedded security solutions segment were million and were mostly associated with labor and personnel related costs  travel as well as amortization of purchased intangible assets 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
general and administrative expenses were and of revenue in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased by million in the smart sensor solutions segment mainly due to increase in acquisition and other related costs of million associated with the acquisitions of upek and safenet s embedded security division  accrual of estimated legal costs of million associated with ibt litigation see part i  item legal proceedings of this annual report for more information  increase in personnel related costs increased of million which included severance charge of million a result of management transition and incremental upek headcount related costs 
million of general and administrative costs consisting primarily of finance and legal expenses were allocated to the embedded security solutions segment 
the general and administrative expenses for the embedded security solutions segment  excluding allocations  were approximately million in and were related to outside legal fees and bad debt allowance 
litigation dismissal 
litigation dismissal expenses were million in as compared to million in  a decrease of million or 
litigation dismissal expenses were and of revenue in and  respectively 
during the twelve months ended december  we recorded million in estimated effective settlement charges as described above as a result of upek acquisition 
during the twelve months ended january  we recorded million in litigation dismissal charges which represented estimated effective settlement charges as a result of patent lawsuit dismissal in connection with atrua asset purchase completed july  restructuring charges 
restructuring charges were million in as compared to none in restructuring charges were and of revenue in and  respectively 
as a result of restructuring activities  we recorded one time employment termination benefits of million  impairment charges of long lived assets of million and legal fees of million 
we expect the restructuring actions to have a positive effect on future earnings and cash flows 
we anticipate annual savings of approximately million in cost of goods sold  million in research and development  million in selling and marketing  and million in general administrative spending resulting from reduced labor and approximately million impacting various operating expenses from facility consolidation 
we anticipate approximately million in additional restructuring charges during the three months ending april  we have paid approximately million in restructuring costs during the three months ended december  and anticipate additional payments of approximately million during the three months ending april  other income expense  net 
other income expense  net decreased by million to a net other expense of million in as compared to net other income of million in the decrease was primarily attributable to the note settlement charge of million recorded in fiscal  reflecting the difference between the initial value of the promissory note issued in connection with the acquisition of upek and the fair value of the  shares of our common stock issued in satisfaction of the note 
lower interest income of million as a result of lower interest rates and maturity of investments as well as foreign currency adjustment also contributed to the decrease whish was slightly offset with the reversal of the earnout liability of million associated with the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of safenet s embedded security solutions division 
income tax expense benefit 
income tax benefit increased to million in from none in mainly due to million reversal of federal amt and accrued interest attributable to the tax year due to the expiration of the federal statute of limitations associated with the upek acquisition 
this reversal was partially offset with the tax provision of million related mostly to our european subsidiaries 
fiscal compared to fiscal prior to  we operated in one reportable segment which is now classified as smart sensor solutions segment 
results in the years prior to represent stand alone amounts which are now considered part of smart sensor solutions segment 
revenue 
our revenue was million in as compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decline in revenue was mostly attributable to the overall global macroeconomic conditions which caused a dramatic drop in end user demand in the pc market for higher end laptops that incorporate our sensors 
the reduction in shipments to our customers adversely impacted our revenue by million for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to the same timeframe last year 
we are also experiencing declining sales prices at the product level which is considered a typical trend within the semiconductor industry 
our average selling prices asps  driven by market conditions and competition within the same  adversely impacted our revenue by million for the year ended january   as compared to the year ended january  cost of revenue and gross profit

although we do not operate manufacturing facilities under our business model  we do provide certain custom assembly and test related equipment to our subcontractors for use in manufacturing our products 
we anticipate that purchases of property and equipment may increase to the extent we invest in new products which require custom assembly and test related equipment 
we did not acquire any intellectual property in other than intangible assets included in business acquisitions 
we purchased intellectual property of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
in the year we purchased patent portfolios from veridicom and also atrua  as part of the asset purchase completed in the second quarter of in the fiscal year  we purchased patents from atmel as an outcome of litigation settlement 
financing activities 
net cash provided by our financing activities was   and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
net cash provided in  and was attributable to cash received from the exercise of stock options 
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity  preserve capital and achieve an acceptable return on invested assets 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of us treasury and us government agency funds and fixed income securities 
the weighted average maturity is less than twelve months 
we utilize investment vehicles such as treasuries  us government agency funds and auction rate securities 
as of december   million of our million in short term and long term investments were comprised of preferred stock investments and a student loan backed security with an auction reset feature auction rate securities 
the preferred stock is issued by a closed end mutual fund that invests primarily in common stock and fixed income securities 
our preferred stock investments carry aaa credit ratings 
the student loan backed auction rate security is a state issued note with its underlying student loans being substantially insured by the us government 
liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  usually every seven  or days 
in the beginning of the auction rate securities markets became disrupted and we experienced auction failures for the first time 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers 
in the event that there is a failed auction  the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for other types of similar short term instruments 
the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every seven  or days until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
as a result  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our remaining auction rate securities in the near term may be limited 
these developments resulted in the classification of these securities as long term investments in our consolidated financial statements at december  at december   the estimated fair value of our preferred stock ars was  less than its cost 
as we intend to hold on to this security until the sooner of a recovery in the ars market or a call of the security by the issuer and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell this ars prior to recovery  we concluded the decline in the fair value was temporary and recorded the unrealized loss to accumulated other comprehensive income on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  at december   the estimated fair value of our student loan ars was  less than its cost 
we recorded other than temporary impairment charge in the amount of  in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended january  we continue to believe that the impairment is other than temporary as this investment has been impaired for an extended period of time and we are not sure of the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments in the future or our ability to hold this security until maturity 
for the year ended december   we recorded a reduction in the other than temporary impairment in the amount of  we recorded additional other than temporary impairment in the amount of  in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended january  we believe that  even if we hold all such securities for an indefinite period of time  our remaining cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to support our projected operating requirements over the next twelve months 
our long term future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our level of revenue  the timing and extent of spending to support our research and development efforts  the expansion of selling and marketing activities  acquisitions  the timing of our introductions of new products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
we could be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing 
these additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
on february  we announced that we had acquired safenet  inc s embedded security solutions division in a cash and stock transaction 
under terms of the transaction  we paid million in cash and issued million of our common stock 
in september  we merged with privately held upek inc  a leading supplier of fingerprint solutions for consumer  business and government applications in a stock transaction 
as part of the merger  upek added million in cash to the combined companies 
contractual obligations the following table describes our contractual obligations as of december  total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases inventory purchase commitments license fees total open purchase obligations represent inventory commitments 
these obligations are not recorded in the consolidated financial statements until commitments are fulfilled and such obligations are subject to change based on negotiations with manufacturers 
we adopted the accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes as of december  the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions  including positions impacting only the timing of tax benefits  was million at december  due to the difficulty in determining the timing of settlements  these obligations are not included in the table above 
we do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risks foreign currency risk 
majority of our revenue is denominated in us dollar  however we do generate revenue that is denominated in other currencies  mostly euro and japanese yen 
we do have risk of our products being more expensive outside the united states if the value of the us dollar increases as compared to the local currency of our customer 
this could result in pricing pressure  lower revenue and lower gross margins 
our international sales and research and development operations incur expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies 
these expenses increased in fiscal as a result of the acquisitions of safenet s embedded security division and upek with main operations being located outside the united states 
to the extent that we expand our operations into europe and asia  the effects of inflation and currency fluctuations could impact our financial condition and results of operations 
a ten percent change in a currency exchange rate could cause an impact to our financial statements of approximately million and we could suffer foreign exchange losses associated with such currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk 
we had cash  cash equivalents and investments of million as of january   which were held for working capital and strategic purposes 
the primary objectives of our investment activity are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and achieve an acceptable return without significantly increasing our risk 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk and reduce exposure  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in investment grade securities that are primarily of a conservative nature 
since our results of operations are not dependent on investments  the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio  and we believe that a change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results from operations 
market risk 
our short term and long term investments consist of us treasury and us government agency funds and auction rate securities that are exposed to certain risks 
although these various investments are managed to a standard designed to avoid principal loss  market forces can have an adverse effect on asset valuations  and it is possible for these investment grade securities to lose a portion of their principal 
the ability to determine the risks presented by these investments is limited by  among other things  restrictions on the ability to know the holdings or the collateral backing of the securities 
at december   we held million in auction rate securities and consider them inactively traded securities 
the rate of interest paid on the auction rate securities is determined at auctions held at pre determined intervals  usually every seven  or days 
if sufficient clearing bids are not made in a particular auction  that can result in the inability to liquidate the asset backed securities in the auction 
all of our auction rate securities held as of december  had experienced failed auctions 
there can be no assurance that auctions on the auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  the fair value of those auction rate securities may decline even further and we may record additional temporary or other than temporary impairment charges 
credit ratings and the market for debt securities may continue to worsen which may also require us to record other than temporary impairment charges 
a change in interest rates would not have a material impact in the fair value of our investments 
for more information on fair value assumptions please see note  fair value measurements and disclosures to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report
