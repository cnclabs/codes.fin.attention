executive overview gas natural is a natural gas company  primarily operating local distribution companies in six states and serving approximately  customers 
our natural gas utility subsidiaries are energy west  incorporated montana and wyoming  cut bank gas company montana  northeast ohio natural gas corporation ohio  brainard gas corp 
ohio  orwell natural gas company ohio and pennsylvania  bangor gas company maine and frontier natural gas north carolina 
our operations also include production and marketing of natural gas and gas pipeline transmission and gathering 
approximately of our revenues in were derived from our utility operations 
for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   the company experienced significant growth in gross margin  income from operations and income before income taxes 
net income was million in as compared to million in the year ended december  included an income tax benefit of million  primarily as a result of the reduction of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset related to the acquisition of frontier utilities and penobscot natural gas 
this is offset by an increase in net income from operations of million in we are focused on building rate base profitably in all of our jurisdictions  maintaining cost discipline  adherence to safety standards  and generating recurring streams of earnings and cash flow that support our continued investment in fixed assets  as well as a return of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends 
in addition  we are actively pursuing our acquisition strategy to further grow our operations 
we intend to continue to reinforce success of bangor gas company and frontier natural gas given the current commodity environment 
we compete against fuel oil in maine and propane distributors in north carolina 
with fuel oil and propane commodity prices tied to the price of oil  we are able to offer a significant value savings to customers within those states 
we are specifically pursuing commercial and industrial customers as we build out our maine and north carolina platforms 
we continue to add residential customers to balance our portfolio 
in october  we entered into note purchase agreements with sunlife assurance company of canada for a private placement of senior secured notes to refinance the ohio utilities existing bank lines of credit and term loans 
on march   we obtained puco approval for the refinancing and expect to close the transaction in the second quarter 
if the refinancing is completed as proposed  orwell  neo  and brainard will jointly issue a million senior secured note 
this note will mature in june and will be fixed rate with interest only payments and no amortization of principal until final maturity 
additionally  great plains would issue a million three year senior secured floating rate note 
in november  we completed a public secondary offering of our common stock  selling million shares including  selling shareholder shares 
the offering proceeds will support our expansion projects in as we seek to obtain additional customers and build rate base across our platform  particularly in maine and north carolina 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to regulatory assets and liabilities  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
regulatory accounting our accounting policies historically reflect the effects of the rate making process in accordance with asc regulated operations 
our regulated natural gas segment continues to be cost of service rate regulated  and we believe the application of asc to that segment continues to be appropriate 
we must reaffirm this conclusion at each balance sheet date 
if  as a result of a change in circumstances  we determine that the regulated natural gas segment no longer meets the criteria of regulatory accounting under asc  that segment will have to discontinue regulatory accounting and write off the respective regulatory assets and liabilities 
the application of asc results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities 
regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
in some cases  we record regulatory assets before we have received approval for recovery from the state regulatory agencies 
we must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery 
we base this conclusion on certain factors  including changes in the regulatory environment  recent rate orders issued by regulatory agencies  and the status of any potential new legislation 
regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or for probable future refunds to customers 
at december   our total regulatory assets were million and our total regulatory liabilities were million 
a write off of the regulatory assets and liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
our natural gas segment contains regulated utility businesses in the states of montana  wyoming  ohio  pennsylvania  maine and north carolina and the regulation varies from state to state 
if future recovery of costs  in any such jurisdiction  ceases to be probable  we would be required to charge these assets to current earnings 
however  there are no current or expected proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that impact the probability of future recovery of these assets 
in addition  deregulation would be a change that occurs over time  due to legal processes and procedures  which could moderate the impact to our consolidated financial statements 
our most significant regulatory asset liability relates to the recoverable refundable costs of gas purchases 
we account for purchased gas costs in accordance with procedures authorized by the state regulatory agencies  under which purchased gas costs that are different from those provided for in present rates are accumulated and recovered or credited through future rate changes 
our gas cost recoveries are monitored closely by the regulatory commissions in all of the states in which we operate 
the gas cost recoveries are adjusted monthly in four of the six states in which we operate  and annually in the other two 
in addition  all of the states in which we operate require us to submit gas procurement plans  which we follow closely 
these plans are reviewed annually by each of the regulatory commissions 
the adjustment of gas cost recoveries and the gas procurement plans reduce the risk of disallowance of recoverable gas costs 
based on our experience  we believe it is highly probable that we will recover the regulatory assets that have been recorded 
during the year ended december   the puco conducted audits of neo and orwell of the rates as filed from january through august and january through june  respectively 
as of december   the puco had not completed the audits of neo and orwell 
the puco did provide the preliminary audit findings noting neo had not included approximately  of costs and orwell included an excess of approximately  of costs in the filings under audit 
in accordance with asc  regulated operations  the company recorded an adjustment of  and  in the company s consolidated statements of income for neo and orwell  respectively 
these adjustments appear on the company s consolidated balance sheet as part of recoverable cost of gas purchases and over recovered gas purchases  respectively 
when 
table of contents the puco concludes each audit  if the amounts are different than initially recorded  the company will record an additional adjustment 
we use our best judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities 
regulatory commissions  however  can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs and those conclusions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accumulated provisions for doubtful accounts we encounter risks associated with the collection of our accounts receivable 
as such  we record a provision for those accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate provision  we primarily utilize the historical accounts receivable write off amounts 
the underlying assumptions used for the provision can change from period to period and the provision could potentially cause a material impact to our income statement and working capital 
the actual weather  commodity prices  and other internal and external economic conditions  such as the mix of the customer base between residential  commercial and industrial  may vary significantly from our assumptions and may impact our operating income 
unbilled revenue and gas costs we estimate the gas service that has been rendered from the latest date of each meter reading cycle to the month end 
this estimate of unbilled usage is based on projected base load usage for each day unbilled plus projected weather sensitive usage for each degree day during the unbilled period 
unbilled revenues and gas costs are calculated from the estimate of unbilled usage multiplied by the rates in effect at month end 
each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable  and the prior month s estimate is reversed 
likewise  the associated gas costs are recorded as cost of revenue and a payable and the prior month s estimate is reversed 
actual price and usage patterns may vary from these assumptions and may impact revenues recognized and costs recorded 
the critical component of calculating unbilled revenue is estimating the usage on a calendar month basis 
our estimated volumes used in the unbilled revenue calculation have varied from our actual monthly metered volumes by less than plus or minus on december  and december  a variance of on our gross margin at december  would have been plus or minus fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and bank borrowings 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is assessed quarterly based on sales and the breakout of aged receivables 
in june  when the revenue cycle is low  specific customer accounts are chosen for write off 
after this adjustment is made  the adequacy of the allowance is considered once again  based on the aging of total accounts receivable and is adjusted if needed 
the fair values of the bank borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and december  and were determined based upon variable interest rates currently available to us for borrowings with similar terms 
recoverable refundable costs of gas we account for purchased gas costs in accordance with procedures authorized by the state regulatory agencies  under which purchased gas costs that are different from those provided for in present rates are accumulated and recovered or credited through future rate changes 
deferred tax asset and income tax accruals judgment  uncertainty  and estimates are a significant aspect of the income tax accrual process that accounts for the effects of current and deferred income taxes 
uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes  regulations  and income tax examinations require that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process 
the company has a deferred tax asset of approximately million as of december  related to the carryover tax basis of frontier utilities of north carolina  inc and penobscot natural gas company 
the million deferred tax asset relates to acquisitions of these two subsidiaries during the carryover tax basis is subject to section of the internal revenue code 
due to limitations imposed under section  the company s tax depreciation is limited in tax years through the company has approximately million of carryover tax basis as of december  starting in  the company will recognize potential future federal and state income tax benefits of approximately million over the remaining life of the carryover tax basis of the assets 
for the federal income tax purposes  the company has concluded that the realization of the deferred tax asset associated with the carryover tax basis will be realized in future reporting periods based on future taxable income projections 
for state income tax purposes  the company has concluded that the realization of the deferred tax asset associated with 
table of contents the carryover tax basis will not be realized  due to state net operating loss carryovers and future state taxable income projections 
as such  management has placed a valuation allowance of approximately million on the state deferred tax assets associated with the carryover tax basis of its subsidiaries acquired during management will reevaluate the valuation allowance each year based on future taxable income projections  and will adjust the deferred tax asset valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that the company will realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets 
if the projections indicate that we are unable to use all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets  the company will adjust the valuation allowance to income tax expense benefit 
the valuation allowance is based on projections of our taxable income in future reporting years 
based on future taxable income projections  the company s state net operating losses will not be realized and as such  management has placed a valuation allowance of approximately million on the state deferred tax asset associated with state net operating losses 
for the federal tax portion  there are two years remaining of the five year internal revenue code limitation period discussed above 
we estimate that approximately of the tax benefit will be available to us during this two year period 
based on our estimates of taxable income  we project that we will recover approximately of the benefit in the following nine years  with recovered in small increments in the remaining years 
based on this analysis  we believe that a valuation allowance on the federal portion of the benefit is not necessary 
failure to achieve projected levels of profitability could lead to a write down in the deferred tax asset if the recovery period becomes uncertain or longer than expected and could also lead to the expiration of the deferred tax asset between now and  either of which would adversely affect our operating results and financial position 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually  which is completed in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired

please see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
capital sources and liquidity sources and uses of cash operating activities provide our primary source of cash 
at december  and  we had approximately million and million of cash on hand  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities consists of net income loss adjusted for non cash items  including depreciation  depletion  amortization  deferred income taxes  and changes in working capital 
our ability to maintain liquidity depends upon our million credit facility with bank of america  shown as line of credit on the accompanying balance sheets 
our use of the bank of america revolving line of credit was million and million at 
table of contents december  and  respectively 
this change in our cash position is primarily due to increases in our capital expenditures due to expansion in our north carolina and maine markets 
we made capital expenditures for continuing operations of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we finance our capital expenditures on an interim basis by the use of our operating cash flow and use of the bank of america revolving line of credit 
we periodically repay our short term borrowings under the bank of america revolving line of credit by using the net proceeds from the sale of long term debt and equity securities 
long term debt was million and million at december  and  respectively 
cash increased to  at december   compared with  at december  for the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities increase in cash operating cash flow for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities decreased million as compared to the year ended december  items affecting the use of cash included an increase in amounts paid on accounts payable of million  an increase in amounts paid for gas supply of million  increased amounts paid for other assets and liabilities of million  and a million decrease in collections of recoverable costs of gas  offset by a million decrease in net deferred tax assets 
cash inflows increased from additional accounts receivable collections of  additional related party receivable collections of million  and a million increase in depreciation expense  offset by a decrease in net income of million 
other changes included higher payments on accrued interest of  a  decrease in prepayments  a  decrease in asset impairments  an increase in payments on accounts payable to related parties of  and a  increase in realized gains on marketable securities 
investing cash flow for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities decreased by million as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a million increase in the sale of marketable securities 
other changes include a million decrease in marketable securities purchases  decreased construction expenditures of  and a decrease of  in purchases of other investments 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures for continuing operations totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we finance our capital expenditures on an interim basis by the use of our operating cash flow and use of the bank of america revolving line of credit 
the majority of our capital spending is focused on the growth of our natural gas operations segment 
we conduct ongoing construction activities in all of our utility service areas in order to support expansion  maintenance  and enhancement of our gas pipeline systems 
we are actively expanding our systems in north carolina and maine to meet the high customer interest in natural gas service in those two service areas 
estimated capital expenditures our capital expenditures for and were as follows and we estimate future cash requirements for capital expenditures will be as follows 
table of contents estimated future year ended december  cash requirements in thousands natural gas operations marketing and production pipeline operations corporate and other total capital expenditures financing cash flow for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities increased by million as compared with the year ended december  the primary reason for this is an increase in sales of common stock of million due to the completion of a secondary public offering in november line of credit proceeds increased by million  while payments decreased by million 
other offsetting changes include an increase of million in payments on other short term borrowings  an increase in payments on related party notes payable of million  and an increase of million in dividends paid 
we fund our operating cash needs  as well as dividend payments and capital expenditures  primarily through cash flow from operating activities and short term borrowing 
historically  to the extent cash flow has not been sufficient to fund these expenditures  we have used our working capital line of credit 
we have greater need for short term borrowing during periods when internally generated funds are not sufficient to cover all capital and operating requirements  including costs of gas purchased and capital expenditures 
in general  our short term borrowing needs for purchases of gas inventory and capital expenditures are greatest during the summer and fall months and our short term borrowing needs for financing customer accounts receivable are greatest during the winter months 
our ability to maintain liquidity depends upon our million credit facility with bank of america  shown as line of credit on the accompanying balance sheets 
our use of the bank of america revolving line of credit was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we periodically repay our short term borrowings under the bank of america revolving line of credit by using the net proceeds from the sale of long term debt and equity securities 
long term debt was million and million at december   and  respectively 
in november  gas natural completed a million share secondary public offering 
of these shares   were selling shareholder shares and million were primary shares 
the primary shares sold by gas natural include a full exercise of the over allotment option 
gas natural did not receive any of the proceeds from the selling shareholder shares 
net proceeds to gas natural were approximately million after sales concessions  underwriting expenses  and deal expenses 
the primary uses of proceeds are for investment in utility operations as we continue to expand our organic footprint 
additionally  proceeds were used to repay three separate ohio utility maturing debt instruments as those entities await final approval of their financing application 
that application was originally filed with the puco in october and was approved on march  upon this approval  gas natural will be able to replenish cash at the holding company for investment in our operating subsidiaries 
in december  neo repaid upon maturity the citizens bank line of credit in the amount of million and orwell repaid upon maturity the huntington bank line of credit in the amount of million and the huntington bank term loan in the amount of million 
these notes were secured by all assets of the ohio utilities  as well as a personal guarantee from our chairman and ceo 
these three instruments had a maturity date due the end of november these notes were repaid and extinguished with no ability to redraw at this time 
as previously stated  gas natural is pursuing a refinancing of those notes through a private placement with qualified institutional investors 
in addition to these notes that had a pending maturity date  a related party demand note was also repaid in december lightning pipeline company  the intermediate holding company for orwell  had a million unsecured demand note payable with our chairman  which was repaid in december of  to include accrued interest 
the following discussion describes our credit facilities as of december  
table of contents bank of america credit facility on june   we established our new five year unsecured credit facility with bank of america for million which replaced a previous one year facility with bank of america for the same amount 
the current credit facility includes an annual commitment fee equal to of the unused portion of the facility and interest on amounts outstanding at the london interbank offered rate  plus to basis points  for interest periods selected by us

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks  including commodity price risk ie  natural gas prices and interest rate risk 
the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
commodity price risk we seek to protect ourself against natural gas price fluctuations by limiting the aggregate level of net open positions that are exposed to market price changes 
we manage such open positions with policies that are designed to limit the exposure to market risk  with regular reporting to management of potential financial exposure 
our risk management committee has limited the types of contracts we will consider to those related to physical natural gas deliveries 
therefore  management believes that although revenues and cost of sales are impacted by changes in natural gas prices  our margin is not significantly impacted by these changes 
credit risk credit risk relates to the risk of loss that we would incur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations under the various instruments with us 
credit risk may be concentrated to the extent that one or more groups of counterparties have similar economic  industry or other characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in market or other conditions 
in addition  credit risk includes not only the risk that a counter party may default due to circumstances relating directly to it  but also the risk that a counterparty may default due to circumstances that relate to other market participants that have a direct or indirect relationship with such counterparty 
we seek to mitigate credit risk by evaluating the financial strength of potential counterparties 
however  despite mitigation efforts  defaults by counterparties may occur from time to time 
to date  no such default has occurred
