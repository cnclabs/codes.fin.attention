you should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
introduction this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the historical performance of our business  its financial condition and its prospects 
we will discuss and provide our analysis of the following overview of business  business segments  results of operations and related information  liquidity and capital resources  adoption of new accounting pronouncements  and critical accounting policies and use of estimates 
overview of business we are a leading producer of technical products and premium fine papers 
we have two primary operations our technical products business and our fine paper business 
in managing our businesses  we believe that achieving and maintaining a leadership position in our markets  responding effectively to competitive challenges  employing capital optimally  controlling costs and managing risks are important to long term success 
changes in input costs and general economic conditions also impact our results 
in this discussion and analysis  we will refer to these factors 
market leadership 
achieving and maintaining market leadership through strong brands  product quality and performance  innovation and supply chain management is an important factor in our results 
our fine paper business  with its well known brands  has long been recognized as a leading manufacturer of world class premium writing  text and cover papers used in corporate identity packages  corporate annual reports  invitations  personal stationery  labels and high end packaging 
our technical products business is also recognized as a leading international supplier in the tape  filtration  component materials  graphics and identification and wall covering markets with products that meet unique and exacting customer requirements 
competitive environment 
our past results have been and our future prospects will be significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate 
in most of our markets  our businesses compete directly with well known competitors  some of which are larger and more diversified 
our businesses also face competitive pressures from lower value products 
economic condition and input costs 
the markets for all of our products are affected to a significant degree by economic conditions  including fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly for the euro 
rapid changes in input costs  particularly for pulp  latex and natural gas  also affect our results 

table of contents business segments our technical products business is a leading international producer of transportation and other filter media  durable  saturated and coated base papers for a variety of end uses and nonwoven wall coverings 
we sell our technical products globally in product categories through five sbus 
we focus on categories where we believe we are  or can be  a market leader  which include  among others  the tape  abrasive  transportation and other filtration media  nonwoven wall coverings  medical packaging and image transfer technical products markets 
we are also a global supplier of materials used for customer specific applications in furniture and book covers 
our customers are located in more than countries 
our technical products manufacturing facilities are located in munising  michigan and near munich and frankfurt  germany 
our fine paper business is a leading producer of premium writing  text  cover and specialty papers used in corporate identity packages  corporate annual reports  invitations  personal stationery  labels and high end packaging 
our products include some of the most recognized and preferred papers in north america  where we enjoy leading market positions in many of our product categories 
we sell our products primarily to authorized paper distributors  converters and specialty businesses  with sales to distributors and distributor owned paper stores accounting for more than two thirds of sales 
we believe that our fine paper manufacturing facilities located in appleton  neenah and whiting  wisconsin are among the most efficient in their markets and make us one of the lowest cost producers in the product categories in which we compete 
results of operations and related information in this section  we discuss and analyze our net sales  income before interest and income taxes which we refer to as operating income in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other information relevant to an understanding of our results of operations 
executive summary results of operations for the year ended december  showed substantial improvement from the depressed amounts reported in the prior year due to increased volume 
results for the year ended december  reflected sharply reduced market demand due to severe global economic weakness  particularly in the first half of in addition  higher selling prices and the benefits of cost reduction initiatives implemented in and allowed us to partially offset the impact of higher manufacturing input costs 
in march  neenah canada sold the woodlands to northern pulp for c million million 
the sale of the woodlands completed our transformation from an integrated pulp and paper company into a technical products and premium fine paper company 
proceeds from the sale were used to repay in full million of outstanding term loan borrowings and repay approximately million in outstanding revolving credit borrowings which reduced the balance of outstanding revolving credit borrowings to zero 
results of continuing operations for the year ended december   consolidated net sales increased approximately million from the prior year to million primarily due to substantially higher shipments in both paper businesses which benefited from improved market conditions higher selling prices  the successful execution of strategic initiatives and by our direct customers replenishing the supply chain 
for the year ended december   average net selling prices were million higher than the prior year period due to an approximately percent increase in average selling prices and a more favorable sales mix in our technical products business 
these favorable variances were partially offset by an million decrease in sales in due to a weakening of exchange rates for the euro versus the us dollar 
consolidated operating income of million for the year ended december  more than tripled from the prior year 
consolidated operating income for the years ended december  and include gains losses related to the closure of the ripon mill of million and million  respectively 
excluding these items  consolidated operating income increased million or percent primarily due to increased volume  including the benefit of improved paper machine utilization  and continuing benefits from initiatives implemented in to reduce spending  which more than offset the effect of higher manufacturing input costs 
for the year ended december   consolidated operating margins  excluding items related to the closure and sale of the ripon mill  of percent increased more than percentage points from the prior year 

table of contents results of discontinued operations the sale of the woodlands resulted in a pre tax gain  net of fees and other transaction costs  of million 
the sale of the woodlands resulted in the substantially complete liquidation of our investment in neenah canada 
in accordance with asc topic  million of cumulative currency translation adjustments attributable to our canadian subsidiaries were reclassified into earnings and recognized as part of the gain on sale of the woodlands 
the sale did not generate a cash tax liability because the tax basis for the woodlands was approximately equal to the sale price 
in addition  there were no tax consequences related to the repatriation of funds from the sale of the woodlands 
for the year ended december   timber sales to northern pulp pursuant to a stumpage agreement resulted in net sales from discontinued operations of million compared to net sales of million in the prior year 
for the year ended december   pre tax income from discontinued operations  excluding the gain on sale of the woodlands  was million compared to earnings from discontinued operations of million in the prior year 
analysis of net sales years ended december   and the following table presents net sales by segment  expressed as a percentage of total net sales before intersegment eliminations year ended december  technical products fine paper total the following table presents our net sales by segment for the periods indicated years ended december  net sales technical products fine paper consolidated commentary year versus for the year ended change in net sales compared to the prior year december  change due to total change volume average net price currency technical products fine paper consolidated consolidated net sales of million for the year ended december  were million higher than the prior year primarily due to increased volume in both segments which benefited from improved market conditions and our direct customers replenishing the supply chain 
for the year ended december   average net selling prices were million higher than the prior year period due to an approximately percent increase in average selling prices and a more favorable sales mix in our technical products business 
net sales in our technical products business of million increased million or percent primarily due to an percent increase in shipments 
higher sales volume reflected strong growth in transportation filter media  abrasive backing  wall covering and tape shipments 
average net selling prices increased due to a more favorable product mix and a two percent improvement in average selling prices 
these favorable variances were partially offset by an million decrease in sales due to a weakening of exchange rates for the euro versus the us dollar 

table of contents net sales in our fine paper business of million increased million or seven percent due to a five percent increase in shipments and higher average net selling prices 
the improved sales volume reflected higher shipments of both premium and value specialty papers  as well as non branded products 
in addition  we benefitted from increased export sales to markets outside north america and strong growth in label  packaging and envelope shipments which in the aggregate grew by more than percent in we believe that we were able to improve our market share position based on the af pa report of a six percent year over year industry decline in the premium writing  text and cover uncoated free sheet paper category 
average selling prices were approximately four percent higher than the prior year primarily as a result of pricing actions implemented in the second half of and throughout for both branded and non branded products 
higher average selling prices were partially offset by a less favorable sales mix which reflected higher growth rates for lower priced products relative to our branded products 
year versus for the year ended change in net sales compared to the prior year december  change due to total change volume average net price currency technical products fine paper consolidated consolidated net sales of million for the year ended december  were million lower than the prior year primarily due to lower volumes 
in addition  results reflected unfavorable currency translation effects due to the weakening of the euro versus the us dollar 
net sales in our technical products business of million decreased million or percent  primarily due to a percent decrease in shipments 
lower sales volume reflected decreased demand in most markets due to weaker economic conditions and inventory destocking by our direct customers  particularly in the first half of sales were also lower as a result of unfavorable currency translation effects due to average euro us dollar exchange rates that were five percent lower in than in the prior year 
net sales were also adversely affected by lower selling prices for certain products in our european business  particularly in the tape and wall cover sbus  which were influenced by currency factors for export prices and additional market capacity  respectively 
net sales in our fine paper business of million decreased million or percent primarily due to a percent decrease in shipments 
we believe that we were able to improve our market share position based on the af pa report of a percent year over year industry decline in the premium writing  text and cover uncoated free sheet paper category 
lower sales volume reflected a sharp decline in consumption for a number of key end use market segments  including advertising  financial institutions and the transportation and real estate segments 
market demand began to decline in late and continued throughout the increase in average net price reflected the realization of price increases on branded and non branded products that were implemented in price increases of approximately three percent on branded products announced late in did not meaningfully impact results until 
table of contents analysis of operating income years ended december   and the following table sets forth line items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated and is intended to provide a perspective of trends in our historical results year ended december  net sales cost of products sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses other income net loss gain on closure and sale of the ripon mill goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charge operating income loss interest expense net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations the following table sets forth our operating income loss by segment for the periods indicated year ended december  operating income loss technical products fine paper unallocated corporate costs consolidated operating income loss as reported adjustments for unusual items fine paper adjustments loss gain on closure and sale of the ripon mill gain on sale of fox river assets total technical products adjustment goodwill impairment charge unallocated corporate costs adjustment settlement of terrace bay retiree litigation total adjustments consolidated operating income as adjusted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  consolidated operating income loss includes the pre tax effects of unusual items 
we believe that by adjusting reported operating income loss to exclude the effects of these items  the resulting adjusted operating income is on a basis that reflects the results of our ongoing operations 
we believe that investors gain additional perspective of underlying business trends and results by providing a measure of operating results that excludes certain gains and losses that are not expected to affect future consolidated or segment operating performance 
adjusted operating income is not a recognized term under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income derived in accordance with gaap 
other companies may use different methodologies for calculating their non gaap financial measures and  accordingly  our non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to their measures

for the year ended december   sg a expense as a percentage of net sales was approximately percent and was percentage points lower than the prior year 
for the year ended december   sg a expense of million was million lower than the prior year primarily due to cost control initiatives implemented in for the years ended december   and  we incurred million  million and million  respectively  of interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense for as compared to was primarily due to lower average debt levels in as a result of the repayment of all term loan and us revolving credit borrowings with proceeds from the sale of the woodlands 
the decrease in interest expense for as compared to was due to lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we recognized additional interest expense of approximately million for costs incurred in conjunction with amending and restating our bank credit agreement and to write off deferred financing costs associated with our previous bank credit agreement 
in general  our effective tax rate differs from the us statutory tax rate of percent primarily due to the benefits of our corporate tax structure and the proportion of pre tax income in jurisdictions with marginal tax rates that differ from the us statutory tax rate

table of contents cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  was million favorable to cash provided by operating activities of million in the prior year 
the favorable comparison to the prior year reflected a million decrease in our investment in working capital  including a refund of us income taxes 
for the year ended december   our investments in working capital increased million 
excluding working capital changes  cash provided by operations for increased million from the prior year 
as of december   we had approximately million of us federal and million of us state nols that may be carried forward to offset future taxable income through investing commentary for the year ended december   cash provided by investing activities was million  compared to cash used by investing activities of million in the prior year 
cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  includes net proceeds from the sale of the woodlands and the ripon mill of million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million compared to spending of million in the prior year 
we have aggregate planned capital expenditures for of approximately million to million 
we believe that the level of our capital spending for will allow us to expand capabilities to successfully pursue strategic initiatives and to maintain the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our manufacturing assets 
for the year ended december   we invested million in long term marketable securities 
for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was million  a decrease of million versus the prior year due to a reduction in capital spending of million 
for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities includes payments by neenah canada of approximately million to northern pulp in connection with the transfer of the pictou mill 
in addition  we paid approximately million in transaction costs 
such payments were more than offset by proceeds from asset sales of million  primarily from the sale of certain fox river assets 
financing commentary our liquidity requirements are provided by cash generated from operations and short and long term borrowings 
we used the net proceeds of million from the sale of the woodlands to extinguish our senior secured term loan the term loan by repaying in full million of outstanding term loan borrowings and repaying approximately million in outstanding revolving credit borrowings which reduced the balance of outstanding revolving credit borrowings to zero 
in addition  we made million in contract termination payments related to the closure of the ripon mill that became due and payable upon the sale of the woodlands 
for the year ended december   cash and equivalents increased million from million at december  to million at december  for the year ended december   debt decreased million from million at december  to million at december  availability under our revolving credit facility varies over time depending on the value of our inventory  receivables and various capital assets 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under our revolving credit agreement and we had million of borrowing availability 
in addition  we have million million  based on exchanges rates at december  of available credit under our german revolving line of credit 
in november  neenah germany renewed the german revolving line of credit on an evergreen basis 
subsequent to november  the agreement may be terminated by either the company or hypovereinsbank upon giving proper notice 
we paid aggregate annual cash dividends of per share or approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in november  we announced a percent increase in the annual cash dividend to per share 
dividends will be paid in four equal quarterly installments effective with the march dividend payment 

table of contents for the year ended december   we purchased million principal amount of our senior notes at slightly less than par value 
from time to time we may purchase additional senior notes 
in february  we elected to conduct an early redemption on march  the partial redemption of million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes 
there are million of senior notes outstanding with a call premium of as of the date of the partial redemption 
the partial redemption is expected to be financed by approximately million of cash on hand  with the remainder to be provided by borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility 
following the partial redemption  million in senior notes will be outstanding and interest expense on the senior notes will be reduced by approximately million per year 
following the partial redemption  we expect to continue to have adequate liquidity to satisfy our cash needs 
we have required debt payments through december  of million 
such payments include required amortization payments on our german loan agreement of approximately million and million on our german line of credit which was extended for an additional months in november as a result of the partial redemption  debt payments for the year ending december  will be million 
management believes that our ability to generate cash from operations and our borrowing capacity are adequate to fund working capital  capital spending and other cash needs for the next months 
our ability to generate adequate cash from operations beyond will depend on  among other things  our ability to successfully implement our business strategies  control costs in line with market conditions and manage the impact of changes in input prices and currencies 
we can give no assurance we will be able to successfully implement these items 
contractual obligations the following table presents the total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable as of december  in millions beyond total long term debt payments a interest payments on long term debt a b open purchase orders c other post employment benefit obligations d contributions to pension trusts liability for uncertain tax positions operating leases minimum purchase commitments e total contractual obligations a in february  we elected to conduct a partial redemption of million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes 
the partial redemption is expected to be financed by approximately million of cash on hand  with the remainder to be provided by borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility following the partial redemption  million in senior notes will be outstanding and required debt payments of approximately million during the year ending december  b interest payments on long term debt includes interest on variable rate debt at december  weighted average interest rates 
c the open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts we anticipate will become payable within the next months for goods and services that we have negotiated for delivery 
d the above table includes future payments that we will make for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions  including expected future service  to project the future obligations 
e the minimum purchase commitments in are primarily for natural gas contracts 
although we are primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and minimum purchase commitments  based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows  we believe our exposure to losses  if any  under these arrangements is not material 

table of contents adoption of new accounting pronouncements for the year ended december   we did not adopt any amendments to the asc that had a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows or financial statement disclosures 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates  and changes in these estimates are recorded when known 
the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments with regard to estimates used 
these critical judgments relate to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of expenses 
the following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the consistent application of our policies provides readers of our financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with our board of directors and audit committee 
inventories we value us inventories at the lower of cost  using the last in  first out lifo method for financial reporting purposes  or market 
german inventories are valued at the lower of cost  using a weighted average cost method  or market 
the first in  first out value of us inventories valued on the lifo method was million and million at december  and  respectively and exceeded such lifo value by million and million  respectively 
cost includes labor  materials and production overhead 
income taxes as of december   we have recorded aggregate deferred income tax assets of million related to temporary differences  net operating losses and credits 
we have established a valuation allowance of million against certain state deferred income tax assets in states where we no longer have operations 
as of december   our aggregate deferred income tax assets were million and had a valuation allowance against such deferred income tax assets of million 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  we consider many factors  including specific taxing jurisdictions  sources of taxable income  income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction 
a valuation allowance would be recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
as of december  and  our liability for uncertain income taxes positions was million and million  respectively 
in evaluating and estimating tax positions and tax benefits  we consider many factors which may result in periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
pension benefits substantially all active employees of our us paper operations participate in defined benefit pension plans and or defined contribution retirement plans 
neenah germany has defined benefit plans designed to provide a monthly pension benefit upon retirement to substantially all of its employees in germany 
in addition  we maintain a supplemental retirement contribution plan the serp which is a non qualified defined benefit plan 
we provide benefits under the serp to the extent necessary to fulfill the intent of its defined benefit retirement plans without regard to the limitations set by the irs on qualified defined benefit plans 
our funding policy for qualified defined benefit plans is to contribute assets to fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation  as required by the pension protection act of subject to regulatory and tax deductibility limits  any funding shortfall is to be eliminated over a reasonable number of years 
nonqualified plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the taxing authorities are not funded 
there is no legal or governmental obligation to fund neenah germany s benefit plans and as such the plans are currently unfunded 

table of contents consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was percent  percent and percent for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets held by our pension trusts was determined based on several factors  including input from pension investment consultants and projected long term returns of broad equity and bond indices 
we also considered the plans historical year and year compounded annual returns 
we anticipate that  on average  actively managed us pension plan assets will generate annual long term rates of return of at least percent 
our expected long term rate of return on the assets in the plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about percent with equity managers  with expected long term rates of return of approximately percent  and percent with fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return of about percent 
the actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
we evaluate our investment strategy and long term rate of return on pension asset assumptions at least annually 
pension expense is estimated based on the fair value of assets rather than a market related value that averages gains and losses over a period of years 
investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of the assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets 
the variance between the actual and the expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a market related value for plan assets was used 
as of december   our pension plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately million 
these unrecognized net losses may increase our future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns  ii other factors  including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate our pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains  including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor determined under asc topic the discount or settlement rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations in the us is generally based on the yield for a theoretical basket of aa rated corporate bonds currently available in the market place  whose duration matches the timing of expected pension benefit payments 
the discount or settlement rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations in germany is generally based on the iboxx index of aa rated corporate bonds adjusted to match the timing of expected pension benefit payments 
the weighted average discount rate utilized to determine the present value of future pension obligations at december  and was percent and percent  respectively 
our consolidated pension expense in is based on the expected weighted average long term rate of return on assets and the weighted average discount rate described above and various other assumptions 
pension expense beyond will depend on future investment performance  our contributions to the pension trusts  changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 
the fair value of the assets in our defined benefit plans at december  of approximately million increased approximately million from the fair value of about million at december   as investment gains and employer contributions exceeded benefit payments 
at december   the projected benefit obligations of our defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately million which was approximately million smaller than the million deficit at december  the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
contributions to pension trusts for the year ended december  were million compared with million for the year ended december  in addition  we made direct benefit payments for unfunded supplemental retirement benefits of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with asc topic  property  plant  and equipment asc topic  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pre tax cash flows 
impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines  future sales volumes  growth rates for selling prices and costs  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets 
impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets 
an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pre tax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount 
we determine fair value based on an expected present value technique using multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value 

table of contents the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and would increase or decrease the impairment charge 
actual outcomes may differ from the estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives goodwill arising from a business combination is recorded as the excess of purchase price and related costs over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with asc topic  business combinations asc topic 
all of our goodwill was acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of neenah germany in october under asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc topic  goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually 
a fair value based test is applied at the reporting unit level  which is generally one level below the operating segment level 
the test compares the fair value of an entity s reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units 
this test requires various judgments and estimates 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using a market approach in combination with a discounted operating cash flow approach 
we record an adjustment to goodwill for any goodwill that is determined to be impaired 
impairment of goodwill is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the fair values of recognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually on november in conjunction with preparation of our annual business plan  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
certain trade names are estimated to have indefinite useful lives and as such are not amortized 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are annually reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc topic our annual test of goodwill for impairment at november  and indicated that the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to neenah germany was considered recoverable 
significant assumptions used in developing the discounted operating cash flow approach were revenue growth rates and pricing  costs for manufacturing inputs  levels of capital investment and estimated cost of capital for high  medium and low growth environments 
our annual test of goodwill for impairment at november   indicated that the carrying value of neenah germany exceeded its estimated fair value 
for the year ended december   we recognized a non cash pre tax loss of million we did not recognize a tax benefit related to the non tax deductible loss for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill assigned to neenah germany over the estimated fair value of goodwill 
the impairment loss was primarily due to a substantial increase in the estimated cost of capital we used to calculate the present value of neenah germany s estimated future cash flows which resulted in a substantially lower estimated fair value 
the higher estimated cost of capital reflected market financial conditions at the time the annual impairment test was performed which indicated higher risk premiums for debt and equity 
as of december   a one percentage point increase in the estimate for our cost of capital used in the impairment test would result in an approximately million change in the estimated fair value of the neenah germany and a corresponding reduction in the implied value of goodwill but would not result in an impairment of goodwill 
other intangible assets with finite lives acquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc topic intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships  trade names and acquired intellectual property 
such intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of between and years 
our annual test of other intangible assets for impairment at november  and indicated that the carrying amount of such assets was recoverable 
during our annual test of other intangible assets for impairment at november   we determined that certain trade names and customer based intangible assets were impaired 
for the year ended december   we recognized a non cash pre tax charge of approximately million for the impairment of such assets 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc topic 
the amount of stock based compensation cost recognized is based on the fair value of grants that are ultimately expected to vest and is recognized pro rata over the requisite service period for the entire award 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise  we are exposed to risks such as changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and environmental regulation 
a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks  including operating and financing activities and  where deemed appropriate  the use of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading 
presented below is a description of our most significant risks 
foreign currency risk our reported operating results are affected by changes in the exchange rates of the euro relative to the us dollar 
for the year ended december   a hypothetical percent decrease in the exchange rates of the euro relative to the u 
s dollar would have decreased our income before income taxes by approximately million 
we do not hedge our exposure to exchange risk on reported operating results 
currency transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the euro 
we performed a sensitivity test to quantify the effects that possible changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar would have on pre tax comprehensive income based on the transactional exposure at december  the effect is calculated by multiplying our net monetary asset or liability position by a percent change in the exchange rate of the euro versus the us dollar 
as of december   a percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the euro involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in net pre tax losses of approximately million 
the translation of the balance sheets of our german operations from euros into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the euro 
consequently  we performed a sensitivity test to determine if changes in the exchange rate would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of our german operations into us dollars 
these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments uta  a component of comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of our german operations by a percent change in the exchange rate of the euro versus the us dollar 
as of december   a percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the euro would have decreased our stockholders equity by approximately million 
the hypothetical decrease in uta is based on the difference between the december  exchange rate and the assumed exchange rate 
commodity risk pulp we purchase the wood pulp used to produce our products on the open market  and  as a result  the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand and government regulation 
we do not have significant influence over the price paid for our wood pulp purchases 
therefore  an increase in wood pulp prices could occur at the same time that prices for our products are decreasing and have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
based on pulp purchases  a percent increase in the average market price for pulp approximately per ton would have increased our annual costs for pulp purchases by approximately million 
other manufacturing inputs we purchase a substantial portion of the other manufacturing inputs necessary to produce our products on the open market  and  as a result  the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand and government regulation 
we do not have significant influence over our costs for such manufacturing inputs 
therefore  an increase in other manufacturing inputs could occur at the same time that prices for our products are decreasing and have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 

table of contents while we believe that alternative sources of critical supplies would be available  an interruption in supply of single source specialty grade latex or specialty softwood pulp to our technical products business or cotton fiber for our fine paper business could disrupt and eventually cause a shutdown of production of certain technical products and fine paper products 
we generate substantially all of the electrical energy used by our munising mill and approximately percent and percent of the electrical energy at our appleton and bruckm hl mills  respectively 
availability of energy is not expected to be a problem in the foreseeable future  but the purchase price of such energy can and likely will fluctuate significantly based on fluctuations in demand and other factors 
there is no assurance that that we will be able to obtain electricity or natural gas purchases on favorable terms in the future 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our fixed rate debt and our variable rate bank debt 
at december   we had million of fixed rate debt outstanding and million of variable rate borrowings outstanding 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt resulting from changes in market interest rates  but not to fluctuations in our earnings or cash flows 
at december   the estimated fair market value of our fixed rate debt was million based upon the quoted market price of the senior notes or rates currently available to us for debt of the same remaining maturities 
a basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate borrowings by approximately million 
we could in the future  reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our variable rate debt by entering into interest rate hedging arrangements  although those arrangements could result in us incurring higher costs than we would incur without the arrangements 
environmental regulation climate change legislation our manufacturing operations are subject to extensive regulation primarily by us  german and other international authorities 
we have made significant capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws  rules and regulations 
due to changes in environmental laws and regulations  including potential future legislation to limit ghg emissions  the application of such regulations and changes in environmental control technology  we are not able to predict with certainty the amount of future capital spending to be incurred for environmental purposes 
taking these uncertainties into account  we have planned capital expenditures for environmental projects during the period through of approximately million to million annually 
we believe these risks can be managed and will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
