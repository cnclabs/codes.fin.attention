table of contents business overview we are a leading national provider of pharmacy and home health services that partners with patients  physicians  hospitals  healthcare payors and pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide clinical management solutions and the delivery of cost effective access to prescription medications and home health services 
our services are designed to improve clinical outcomes to patients with chronic and acute healthcare conditions while controlling overall healthcare costs 
as of december   we had a total of locations in states plus the district of columbia  including community pharmacy locations  home nursing locations  three mail service facilities and home infusion locations  including two contract affiliated infusion pharmacies 
our platform provides nationwide service capabilities and the ability to deliver clinical management services that offer patients a high touch  community based and home based care environment 
our core services are provided in coordination with  and under the direction of the patient s physician 
our home health professionals  including pharmacists  nurses  respiratory therapists and physical therapists  work with the physician to develop a plan of care suited to our patient s specific needs 
whether in the home  physician office  ambulatory infusion center or other alternate site of care  we provide products  services and condition specific clinical management programs tailored to improve the care of individuals with complex health conditions such as gastrointestinal abnormalities  hiv aids  cancer  iron overload  multiple sclerosis  organ transplants  rheumatoid arthritis  immune deficiencies and congestive heart failure 
on march   we acquired chs  a privately held  leading provider of home infusion and home health services 
chs was principally owned by funds managed by kohlberg company  llc our acquisition of chs provided us with a national network of home infusion pharmacies and home health service providers 
the additional chs managed care organization mco relationships of more than increased our total mco relationships to over  the acquisition also significantly expanded our national footprint 
on july   the company acquired the prescription pharmacy business and assets of ds pharmacy  a wholly owned subsidiary of drugstore 
com  inc 
the acquisition provided the company with an expanded presence in on line pharmacy and a six year license of drugstore 
com capabilities  trademarks and trade names 
the agreements also allow customers to order from the company through the drugstore 
com website 
during the year ended december   we renegotiated certain discount cash card broker agreements to provide for the payment of higher broker fees for new discount cash card sales generation 
we expect these new rates to provide additional incentives for new member growth over the next several quarters  thereby increasing these programs profitability over the long term 
if anticipated growth is achieved  broker fees could increase million to million quarterly compared to prior year 
the net impact to operating income is expected to return to historical levels by the third quarter of and going forward 
the acquisition of chs caused us to re evaluate our segment reporting 
as a result of this review  we changed our segments from specialty pharmacy services and traditional pharmacy services to our new segments infusion home health services and pharmacy services 
these two new segments reflect how our codm reviews our results in terms of allocating resources and assessing operating and financial performance 
prior period disclosures reflect the change in reportable segments 
the infusion home health services segment consists of our legacy home infusion business combined with the home infusion and home health service businesses obtained in the chs acquisition 
the infusion services provided in this segment includes home infusion therapy  respiratory therapy and dme 
infusion services include the dispensing and administering of infusion based drugs  which typically require additional nursing and clinical management services  equipment to administer the correct dosage and patient training designed to improve patient outcomes 
through the home health services reported under this segment  we provide skilled nursing and therapy visits  private duty nursing services  rehabilitation services  hospice and medical social services to patients primarily in their home 
the pharmacy services segment consists of our traditional and specialty pharmacy mail operations  community pharmacies  prescription discount card programs and integrated pbm services 
the ds pharmacy business acquired in july is included in this segment 
these segment services are designed to offer customers and patients cost effective delivery of traditional and specialty pharmacy products and services 
the services also include care management programs customized to each patient s care plan in coordination with the patient s physician 
we have presented segment information on the basis of net loss income adjusted for net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense segment adjusted ebitda and prior to the allocation of corporate expenses 
segment adjusted ebitda excludes the loss on extinguishment of debt  acquisition  integration and severance expenses  restructuring expense  goodwill and intangible impairment  write off of receivables related to the cap contract and legal settlement expenses 
we believe that segment adjusted ebitda from operations provides a better indication of the segment operating performance 
the segment adjusted ebitda measurement is the primary measure used by the codm in evaluating our operating and financial performance 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates  and different assumptions or conditions may yield different estimates 
the following discussion highlights what we believe to be the critical accounting estimates and judgments made in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all the accounting estimates or judgments made in the preparation of our financial statements and in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in its application 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report  which contain a description of our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

table of contents revenue recognition we generate revenue principally through the sale of prescription drugs and nursing services 
prescription drugs are dispensed either through a pharmacy participating in our pharmacy network or a pharmacy owned by us 
fee for service agreements include i pharmacy agreements  where we dispense prescription medications through our pharmacy facilities and ii pbm agreements  where prescription medications are dispensed through pharmacies participating in our retail pharmacy network as well as through our traditional mail service facility 
financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements asc  addresses situations in which there are multiple deliverables under one revenue arrangement with a customer and provides guidance in determining whether multiple deliverables should be recognized separately or in combination 
we provide a variety of therapies to patients 
for infusion related therapies  we frequently provide multiple deliverables of drugs and related nursing services 
after applying the criteria from asc  we concluded that separate units of accounting exist in revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
drug revenue is recognized at the time the drug is shipped  and nursing revenue is recognized on the date of service 
revenue generated under pbm agreements is classified as either gross or net based on whether we are acting as a principal or an agent in the fulfillment of prescriptions through our retail pharmacy network 
when we independently have a contractual obligation to pay a network pharmacy provider for benefits provided to its plan sponsors members  and therefore are the primary obligor as defined in asc topic  revenue recognition asc  we include payments which include the drug ingredient cost from these plan sponsors as revenue and payments to the network pharmacy providers as cost of revenue 
these transactions require us to pay network pharmacy providers  assume credit risk of plan sponsors and act as a principal 
if we merely act as an agent  and consequently administer plan sponsors network pharmacy contracts  we do not have the primary obligation to pay the network pharmacy and assume credit risk and as such record only the administrative fees and not the drug ingredient cost as revenue 
in our infusion home health services segment  we also recognize infusion nursing revenue as the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and plan sponsors for services rendered and products provided 
this revenue is recognized as the treatment plan is administered to the patient and is recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement or payment arrangements with payors 
under the medicare prospective payment system program  home health net revenue is recorded based on a reimbursement rate which varies based on the severity of the patient s condition  service needs and certain other factors 
revenue is recognized ratably over a day episode period and is subject to adjustment during this period if there are significant changes in the patient s condition during the treatment period or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same day episodic period 
medicare cash receipts under the prospective payment system are initially recognized as deferred revenue and are subsequently recognized as revenue over the day episode period 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
the risk of collection varies based upon the product  the payor commercial health insurance and government and the patient s ability to pay the amounts not reimbursed by the payor 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon several factors including the age of the outstanding receivables  the historical experience of collections  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer accounts for the ability to pay 
collection agencies are employed and legal action is taken when we determine that taking collection actions is reasonable relative to the probability of receiving payment on amounts owed 
management judgment is used to assess the collectability of accounts and the economic ability of our customers to pay 
judgment is also used to assess trends in collections and the effects of systems and business process changes on our expected collection rates 
the company reviews the estimation process quarterly and makes changes to the estimates as necessary 
when it is determined that a customer account is uncollectible  that balance is written off against the existing allowance 
the following table sets forth the aging of our december  and december  gross accounts receivable net of allowance for contractual adjustments  and prior to allowance for doubtful accounts  aged based on date of service and categorized based on the three primary overall types of accounts receivable characteristics in thousands as of december  days over days total government commercial patient allowance for doubtful accounts total as of december  days over days total government commercial patient allowance for doubtful accounts total commercial includes one pharmacy network agreement under which various plan sponsors are served and which plan sponsors account for  in the aggregate  receivables that accounted for and of the company total accounts receivable balance as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents allowance for contractual discounts we are reimbursed by plan sponsors for services we provide 
payments for medications and services covered by plan sponsors are generally less than billed charges 
we monitor revenue and receivables from plan sponsors on an account specific basis and record an estimated contractual allowance for certain revenue and receivable balances at the revenue recognition date to properly account for anticipated differences between amounts billed and amounts reimbursed 
accordingly  the total revenue and receivables reported in our financial statements are recorded at the amounts expected to be received from these payors 
since billing functions for a majority of our revenue are largely computerized  which enables on line adjudication ie  submitting charges to medicare  medicaid or other third party payors electronically  with simultaneous feedback of the amount the primary insurance plan expects to pay at the time of sale to record net revenue  exposure to estimating contractual allowance adjustments is limited primarily to unbilled and or initially rejected medicare  medicaid and third party claims typically approved for reimbursement once additional information is provided to the payor 
for the remaining portion of our revenue  the contractual allowance is estimated based on several criteria  including unbilled and or initially rejected claims  historical trends based on actual claims paid  current contract and reimbursement terms  and changes in customer base and payor product mix 
contractual allowance estimates are adjusted to actual amounts as cash is received and claims are settled 
we do not believe these changes in estimates are material 
amounts due to plan sponsors payables to plan sponsors primarily represent payments received from plan sponsors in excess of the contractually required reimbursement 
these amounts are refunded to plan sponsors 
these payables also include the sharing of manufacturers rebates with plan sponsors in the pharmacy services segment 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes under asc topic  income taxes asc 
asc requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred taxes are determined by calculating the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial accounting and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize the benefit from our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is reversed when sufficient evidence exists that we will be able to realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets 
income tax expense in the year ended december  included the establishment of a valuation allowance recorded on deferred tax assets of million 
the income tax benefit in the year ended december  included million related to the reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
we file income tax returns  including returns for our subsidiaries  as prescribed by federal tax laws and the tax laws of the state and local jurisdictions in which we operate 
our uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination and are recognized in the financial statements when the recognition threshold and measurement attributes of asc are met 
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as income tax expense 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc  we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 
the valuation is based on a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the first step indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the second step must be performed which determines the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill 
the measurement of possible impairment is based upon the comparison of the implied fair value of reporting unit to its carrying value 
we use a third party valuation specialist to assist in the annual impairment valuation 
as of december   our reporting units include goodwill of million and indefinite lived assets of million in the infusion home health reporting unit and goodwill of million in the pharmacy services reporting unit 
the goodwill of the infusion home health reporting unit was recorded as a result of the acquisition of chs in march in performing 
in performing an annual evaluation of goodwill  a reporting unit fair value is determined based on discounted future cash flows and a market based comparison to industry peers 
significant estimates used in a fair value determination include future forecasted earnings and the working capital requirements of the business to generate estimated cash flows 
carrying values are determined based on the specific assets and liabilities of each reporting unit and allocations of corporate assets  liabilities and expenses 
if future cash flows do not achieve estimated levels  goodwill could be become impaired in future periods 
definite lived intangible assets are also evaluated to determine if the carrying value of those assets is recoverable 
at december   definite lived intangible assets included million in trademarks  trade names and customer relationships acquired in the chs transaction 
definite lived intangible assets also included million in assets related to the acquisition of the prescription pharmacy business from ds pharmacy 
the value of these assets is determined based largely upon discounted cash flows 
if future cash flows do not achieve estimated levels  intangible assets could become impaired in future periods 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  property  plant and equipment asc 
the measurement of possible impairment of property  plant and equipment is based on the ability to recover the balance of assets from expected future operating cash flows on an undiscounted basis 
impairment losses  if any  would be determined based on the present value of the cash flows using discount rates that reflect the inherent risk of the underlying business 
accounting for stock base compensation compensation cost for all share based payments are based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option pricing model that uses the following assumptions i expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock  ii the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant  and iii the expected life of options granted is derived from previous history of stock exercises from the grant date and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
we use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination assumptions under the valuation model 
the fair value of the award is amortized to expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we expense restricted stock awards based on vesting requirements  including time elapsed  market conditions  and or performance conditions 
because of these requirements  the weighted average period for which the expense is recognized varies 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any unconsolidated special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
reclassifications certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
such reclassifications had no material effect on our previously reported consolidated financial statements

the increase was partially offset by price concessions granted to a major customer starting january  totaling million 
also partially offsetting the increase was a million decrease in reimbursement from certain state governmental agencies that declined to adjust their reimbursement rates following the implementation of the industry wide awp settlement in september as such  our reimbursement for services provided to government funded and or operated programs was reduced 
in addition to reimbursement reductions from government funded and or operated plans  we experienced other rate reductions from commercial payors in the wake of the awp settlement of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the year ended december  were million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue  for the same period in the increase in sg a was primarily due to million of additional expense related to chs  a million increase in wages and salaries to strengthen the management and sales team and an increase of million in brokers fees related to growth in our prescription discount cash card business 
due to the management costs associated with the large number of care professionals involved in delivering services  the infusion home health services segment operates at a higher operating expense ratio to revenue than the pharmacy services segment 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in management bonus expense  as the related specified annual criteria was not achieved

should we recover amounts reserved  they will be a reduction of future bad debt expense 
the write off of cap receivables during the year resulted in an increase in bad debt expense of of revenue 
approximately million of the bad debt expense increase was related to the acquisition of chs and resulting increase in revenue 
the remaining million increase is due to our current collection experience on aged balances 
restructuring expense 
in the fourth quarter of  the we commenced a strategic assessment of its business

these expenses are included in selling  general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
while these expenses have not been material to our financial performance or condition  there is no assurance that these expenses will not increase 
we also are not able to predict the outcome of these investigations  which could result in damage claims  fines or monetary settlements that may be material to our financial performance in the reporting period in which they occur 
interest expense  net

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we utilize funds generated from operations for general working capital needs  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
net cash used in operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million of cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  this million decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of an increase in working capital requirements of million compared to the prior year 
working capital includes the impact of changes in receivables  inventory  prepaid expenses and other assets  accounts payable  claims payable  amounts due to plan sponsors and accrued expenses and other liabilities 
approximately million of the increased working capital requirements related to receivables due to a delay in payment of million on a total balance of million from a major customer as of december  as of march   million of outstanding december  receivables have been collected from this customer 
there was a reduction of million in accrued expenses and other liabilities  excluding liabilities acquired  mainly due to bonuses paid in in addition to the increase in working capital requirements  cash provided by operations decreased due to an increase in interest paid on the original senior secured facility and senior unsecured notes

net cash used in investing activities in was million compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in this million decrease was a result of decreased spending on information technology infrastructure 
net cash used in financing activities in was million compared to million net cash provided by financing activities in the million change was primarily due to a net reduction in our debt level during at december   we had working capital of million compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily due to an increase in the current portion of long term debt as a result of the revolving credit facility  defined below 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in working capital from the operations of chs and ds pharmacy

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our outstanding debt 
at december   we had million of long term debt which is not subject to variable interest rates and million of short term debt  of which is subject to variable interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowing activities under the revolving credit facility  discussed in item of this report 
a one percent increase in current market interest rates would have approximately  impact on our annual net interest expense 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not a party to any derivative financial instruments at this time 
management does not believe that our exposure to interest rate market risk is material at this time because the variable interest rate negotiated in the revolving credit facility is subject to a rate floor which is above current market rates 
market rates can increase and not cause an increase in our variable interest rate 
our revolving credit facility agreement provides for the use of interest rate swaps as a strategy to manage interest rate market risk 
we regularly assess the significance of interest rate market risk as part of our treasury operations and as circumstances change and will enter into interest rate swaps as appropriate 
at december   the carrying values of accounts receivable  accounts payable  claims payable  payables to plan sponsors and others approximate fair value due to their short term nature 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility include debt with variable interest rates totaling million at december  we believe the carrying value of our long term debt under our revolving credit facility approximates fair market value
