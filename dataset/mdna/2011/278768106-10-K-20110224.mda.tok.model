item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cash flows from investing activities 
our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities  capital expenditures and strategic investments 
for the years ended december   and  we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in net cash outflows from investing activities from to of million primarily resulted from net purchases of marketable investment securities of million in and net sales of marketable investment securities of million in for a net change of million  partially offset by cash inflows of million related to the assignment of rights under a launch contract to dish network  cash inflows related to a decline in the capital expenditures of million compared to and proceeds from the sale of strategic investments of million 
the decrease in net cash outflows from investing activities from to of million primarily resulted from net sales of marketable investment securities of million in and net purchases of marketable investment securities of million in for a net change of million 
cash flows from financing activities 
our financing activities generally include cash used for payment of capital lease obligations  mortgages or other notes payable  and repurchases of our class a common stock 
for the years ended december  and we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december  we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of million 
the decline in net cash outflows from financing activities from to of million principally resulted from a decrease in repurchases of class a common stock during compared to the decline in net cash flow from financing activities from to of million principally resulted from the contribution from dish network in connection with the spin off of million  partially offset by a decrease in repurchases of class a common stock during compared to satellites as our satellite fleet ages  we will be required to evaluate replacement alternatives such as acquiring  leasing or constructing additional satellites  with or without customer commitments for capacity 
stock repurchases during the years ended december   and  we repurchased  million  and million shares of our common stock for  million and million  respectively 
on november   our board of directors extended the plan and authorized an increase in the maximum dollar value of shares that may be repurchased under the plan  such that we are currently authorized to repurchase up to million of our outstanding shares of class a common stock through and including december  as of december   we may repurchase up to million under this plan 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued obligations and future capital requirements contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december  future maturities of our contractual obligations are summarized as follows payments due by period total thereafter in thousands long term debt obligations capital lease obligations interest expense on long term debt and capital lease obligations satellite related obligations operating lease obligations purchase and other obligations total in certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed 
these amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction  launch or lease of additional satellites 
the table above does not include million of liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits which were accrued  discussed in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  and are included on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  we do not expect any portion of this amount to be paid or settled within the next twelve months 
in connection with terrestar networks bankruptcy  we entered into agreements to provide a million credit facility to terrestar networks and certain of its affiliates  of which million has been funded as of december  the table above does not include any unfunded amounts 
see note under investments in terrestar in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
during december  we entered into a joint venture to provide a dth satellite service in taiwan and certain other targeted regions in asia 
we own and have joint control of the joint venture 
pursuant to these arrangements  we sell hardware such as digital set top boxes and provide certain technical support services to the joint venture 
we have provided million of cash to the joint venture  and an million line of credit that the joint venture may only use to purchase set top boxes from us 
this investment is subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis 
this quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing  among other things  company business plans and current financial statements  if available  for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million charge to fully impair this investment  which is included in unrealized and realized gains losses on marketable investment securities and other investments on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
as of december   the remaining amount available under the line of credit is million and if advanced would be subject to our evaluation for other than temporary impairment 
the table above includes this million under purchase and other obligations 
in general  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued satellite related obligations satellites under construction 
as of december   we had entered into the following contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next two years 
future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under satellite related obligations 
quetzsat during  we entered into a ten year satellite service agreement with ses to lease all of the capacity on quetzsat quetzsat is expected to be launched during the second half of and will operate at the degree orbital location 
upon expiration of the initial term  we have the option to renew the transponder service agreement on a year to year basis through the end of life of the quetzsat satellite 
dish network has agreed to lease of the dbs transponders on this satellite from us 
the expected future payments related to quetzsat included in the table above are million 
echostar xvi 
during november  we entered into a contract for the construction of echostar xvi  a dbs satellite  which is expected to be completed during the second half of and will operate at the degree orbital location 
dish network has agreed to lease all of the capacity on this satellite from us for a portion of its useful life 
the expected future payments related to echostar xvi included in the table above are million 
purchase obligations our purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for digital set top boxes and related components  digital broadcast operations and transitional service agreements 
our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to  among other things  management s control of inventory levels  and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances  and our future working capital requirements 
satellite insurance we generally do not carry insurance for any of the in orbit satellites that we use because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite failure 
the loss of a satellite or other satellite malfunctions or anomalies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance which we may not be able to mitigate by using available capacity on other satellites 
there can be no assurance that we can recover critical transmission capacity in the event one or more of our in orbit satellites were to fail 
in addition  the loss of a satellite or other satellite malfunctions or anomalies could affect our ability to comply with fcc regulatory obligations and our ability to fund the construction or acquisition of replacement satellites for our in orbit fleet in a timely fashion  or at all 
future capital requirements we primarily rely on our existing cash and marketable investment securities balances  as well as cash flow generated through operations to fund our investment needs 
since we currently depend on dish network for a substantial portion of our revenue  our cash flow from operations depends heavily on their needs for equipment and services 
as disclosed by dish network in its annual report on form k for the year ended december   dish network had higher than normal inventory levels of digital set top boxes and related components at december  and also experienced fewer gross subscriber additions during while we expect that dish network will continue to purchase digital set top boxes and related components from us  dish network s higher than normal inventory levels  could result in fewer purchases of digital set top boxes and related components from us than it has purchased during the year ended december  a significant decline in dish network s purchases from us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
to the extent that dish network experiences a net loss of subscribers  sales of our digital set top boxes and related components to dish network may further decline  which in turn could have a further material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
as a result  there can be no assurances that we will always have positive cash flows from operations and should our cash flows turn negative  our existing cash and marketable investment securities balances may be reduced 
our future capital expenditures are likely to increase if we make additional investments in infrastructure necessary to support and expand our satellite services business  or if we decide to purchase one or more additional satellites 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other aspects of our business operations may also require additional capital 
we periodically evaluate various strategic initiatives  the pursuit of which also could require us to raise significant additional capital 
we may also use a significant portion of our existing cash to fund our stock buyback program of up to million of our class a common stock  all of which remained available as of december  however  there can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms or at all 
any renewed weakness in the financial markets could make it difficult for certain borrowers to access capital markets at acceptable terms or at all  which may significantly constrain our ability to obtain financing to support our business operations 
this may have a significant effect on our cost of financing and our liquidity position and may  as a result  cause us to defer or abandon profitable business strategies that we would otherwise pursue if financing were available on acceptable terms 
in particular  it may be difficult for us to raise debt financing on acceptable terms in light of the fact that we have never previously raised debt financing 
in addition  sustained economic weakness may limit our ability to generate sufficient internal cash to fund investments  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other strategic transactions 
any renewed instability in the equity markets could make it difficult for us to raise equity financing without incurring substantial dilution to our existing shareholders  and debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets and enter into covenants that could restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our shareholders or us 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or joint venture agreements on unattractive terms 
on february   we and certain of our subsidiaries  including echostar satellite services llc  ess entered into an agreement and plan of merger the hughes agreement with hughes  whereby we will acquire all of the outstanding equity of hughes and its subsidiaries  including its main operating subsidiary  hughes network systems  llc hns the hughes merger 
pursuant to the hughes agreement  each issued and outstanding share of common stock of hughes other than common stock with respect to which appraisal rights have been exercised will be converted into the right to receive in cash 
the hughes agreement also contemplates the repayment of all of the outstanding debt of hughes and hns including the senior notes due issued by hns  except that the million loan facility guaranteed by coface  the french export credit agency  will continue to remain outstanding following the merger if certain consents are obtained 
as a result  the hughes merger is valued at approximately billion  including the hughes debt expected to be refinanced 
the hughes merger is expected to close later this year  subject to certain closing conditions  including among others  certain government regulatory approvals  such as approval by the fcc and the federal trade commission 
the hughes agreement contains certain termination rights for both hughes and us 
in order to finance the hughes merger  we and ess obtained an aggregate financing commitment of billion in senior secured bridge financing and million in senior unsecured bridge financing  in each case from deutsche bank ag cayman islands branch collectively  the bridge commitment 
deutsche bank s obligations under the bridge commitment are subject to a number of conditions  including that the conditions to closing under the hughes agreement have been met subject to certain exceptions  that we have a minimum amount of cash on hand at the closing  that we have provided certain financial statements and other information relating to us and hughes in specified time periods  and that our aggregate indebtedness not exceed specified levels 
there is no assurance that we will be able to satisfy these conditions 
the initial term of the bridge commitment is six months 
we have the option to extend the term of the bridge commitment to nine months so long as we have delivered certain required information  including certain financial statements  and have complied with our obligations to issue debt securities in lieu of borrowing under the bridge commitment 
subject to certain exceptions  we do not have the ability to terminate the hughes agreement until nine months after the date the hughes agreement was executed 
accordingly  there is no assurance that the bridge commitment will remain in effect for the duration of our obligations under the hughes agreement 
we do not have the ability to terminate the hughes agreement if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our obligations under the hughes agreement 
if the funding under the bridge commitment were to become unavailable for any reason  there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our obligations under the hughes agreement 
in addition  if we are unsuccessful in overturning the district court s ruling on tivo s motion for contempt  we are not successful in developing and deploying potential new alternative technology and we are unable to reach a license agreement with tivo on reasonable terms  we may be required to cease distribution of digital set top boxes with dvr 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued functionality 
in that event  our sales of digital set top boxes to dish network and others would likely significantly decrease and could even potentially cease for a period of time 
furthermore  the inability to offer dvr functionality would place us at a significant disadvantage to our competitors and make it even more difficult for us to penetrate new markets for digital set top boxes 
the adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations if the district court s contempt order is upheld would be significant 
if we are successful in overturning the district court s ruling on tivo s motion for contempt  but unsuccessful in defending against any subsequent claim in a new action that our original alternative technology or any potential new alternative technology infringes tivo s patent  we could be prohibited from distributing dvrs 
in that event  we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering dvr functionality and the adverse effect on our business would be material 
because both we and dish network are defendants in the tivo lawsuit  we and dish network are jointly and severally liable to tivo for any final damages and sanctions that may be awarded by the district court 
dish network has agreed that it is obligated under the agreements entered into in connection with the spin off to indemnify us for substantially all liability arising from this lawsuit 
we contributed an amount equal to our million intellectual property liability limit under the receiver agreement  and during  we recorded a charge included in general and administrative expenses dish network on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for this amount to reflect this contribution 
we and dish network have further agreed that our million contribution would not exhaust our liability to dish network for other intellectual property claims that may arise under the receiver agreement 
we and dish network also agreed that we would each be entitled to joint ownership of  and a cross license to use  any intellectual property developed in connection with any potential new alternative technology 
because we are jointly and severally liable with dish network  to the extent that dish network does not or is unable to pay any damages or sanctions arising from this lawsuit  we would then be liable for any portion of these damages and sanctions not paid by dish network 
any amounts that dish network may be required to pay could impair its ability to pay us and also negatively impact our future liquidity 
if we become liable for any portion of these damages or sanctions  we may be required to raise additional capital at a time and in circumstances in which we would normally not raise capital and there can be no assurance that such capital would be available on terms that would be attractive to us or at all 
therefore  any capital we raise may be on terms that are unfavorable to us  which might adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and might also impair our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms in the future to fund our own operations and initiatives 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
management bases its estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results reported in future periods may be affected by changes in those estimates 
the following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation  judgment and complexity 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities 
we hold debt and equity interests in companies  some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices 
we record an investment impairment charge in unrealized and realized gains losses on marketable investment securities and other investments within other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary 
we monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment  market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment 
future adverse changes in these factors 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
fair value of financial instruments 
fair value estimates of our financial instruments are made at a point in time  based on relevant market data as well as the best information available about the financial instrument 
weak economic conditions have resulted in inactive markets for certain of our financial instruments  including marketable and other investment securities on our consolidated balance sheets 
for certain of these instruments  there is no or limited observable market data 
fair value estimates for financial instruments for which no or limited observable market data is available are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions  liquidity discounts  currency  credit and interest rate risks  loss experience  bankruptcy and other factors 
these estimates involve significant uncertainties and judgments and may be a less precise measurement of fair value as compared to financial instruments where observable market data is available 
we make certain assumptions related to expected maturity date  credit and interest rate risk based upon market conditions and prior experience 
as a result  such calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrument 
in addition  changes in the underlying assumptions used in the fair value measurement technique  including liquidity risks  and estimate of future cash flows  could significantly affect these fair value estimates  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
for example  as of december   we held million of securities that lack observable market quotes and a decrease in our estimated fair value of these securities would result in a decrease of the reported amount by approximately million 
furthermore  our investments accounted for at fair value are speculative 
the changes in the fair value of these investments have historically been volatile 
if the fair value of these investments of million as of december  decreased by  for example  we would have recorded a decrease in the reported amount by million in unrealized losses under unrealized gains losses on investments accounted for at fair value  net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
acquisition of investments in non marketable investment securities 
we calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either as consideration given  or for non cash acquisitions  based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or dcf model 
the dcf methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required 
valuation of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recorded in impairments of goodwill  indefinite lived and long lived assets on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs 
among other reasons  changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually  and also when events and circumstances warrant 
we use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment  if any  of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
while our impairment tests in indicated the fair value of our intangible assets were significantly above their carrying amounts  significant changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period  which would be recorded in impairments of goodwill  indefinite lived and long lived 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued assets on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss and could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
a decrease in the estimated future cash flows or a increase in the discount rate used in estimating the fair value of these assets while all other assumptions remain unchanged would not result in these assets being impaired 
income taxes 
our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities 
we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence  including trends  and future expectations in each reporting period 
any such valuation allowance is recorded in either income tax provision benefit  net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss or accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity deficit on our consolidated balance sheets 
future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits  or reversals of valuation allowances  as reported in our consolidated results of operations 
uncertainty in tax positions 
management evaluates the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions based on applicable tax law  regulations  case law  administrative rulings and pronouncements and the facts and circumstances surrounding the tax position 
changes in our estimates related to the recognition and measurement of the amount recorded for uncertain tax positions could result in significant changes in our income tax provision benefit  which could be material to our consolidated results of operations 
contingent liabilities 
a significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when  or if  an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual 
estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes 
due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event  it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter  a charge could be recorded in a future period to selling  general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued new accounting pronouncements revenue recognition multiple deliverable arrangements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple deliverable arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price 
this standard was effective january  we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
seasonality we are affected by seasonality to the extent it impacts our customers 
our customers in the pay tv industry  including dish network  our largest customer  typically experience seasonality 
historically  the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers for the pay tv industry than the second half of the year 
however  we can not provide assurance that this will continue in the future 
inflation inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years 
we believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures or contractual terms 
backlog we do not have any material backlog

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks associated with financial instruments our investments and debt are exposed to market risks  discussed below 
cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had a fair value of billion 
of that amount  a total of million was invested in a cash  b vrdns convertible into cash at par value plus accrued interest generally in five business days or less  c debt instruments of the united states government and its agencies  d commercial paper and corporate notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  and or e instruments with similar risk  duration and credit quality characteristics to the commercial paper and corporate obligations described above 
the primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to  among other things  fund operations  make strategic investments and expand the business 
consequently  the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business 
the value of this portfolio is negatively impacted by credit losses  however  this risk is mitigated through diversification that limits our exposure to any one issuer 
interest rate risk a change in interest rates would affect the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities portfolio 
based on our december  current non strategic investment portfolio of million  a hypothetical increase in average interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately million in fair value of this portfolio 
we normally hold these investments to maturity  however  the hypothetical loss in fair value would be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 
our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had an average annual rate of return for the year ended december  of 
a change in interest rates would affect our future annual interest income from this portfolio  since funds would be re invested at different rates as the instruments mature 
a hypothetical decrease in average interest rates during would result in a decrease of approximately million in annual interest income 
strategic marketable investment securities as of december   we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of million 
these investments  which are held for strategic and financial purposes  are concentrated in a small number of companies  are highly speculative and have experienced and continue to experience volatility 
the fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally  as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in  risks associated with specific industries  and other factors 
these investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses 
in general  the debt instruments held in our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio are not significantly impacted by interest rate fluctuations as their value is more closely related to factors specific to the underlying business 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of these investments 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued restricted cash and marketable investment securities and noncurrent marketable and other investment securities restricted cash and marketable investment securities as of december   we had million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities invested in a cash  b vrdns convertible into cash at par value plus accrued interest generally in five business days or less  c debt instruments of the united states government and its agencies  d commercial paper and corporate notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  and or e instruments with similar risk  duration and credit quality characteristics to the commercial paper described above 
based on our december  investment portfolio  a hypothetical increase in average interest rates would not have a material impact in the fair value of our restricted cash and marketable investment securities 
other investment securities as of december   we had million of public and nonpublic debt and equity instruments that we hold for strategic business purposes and account for under the cost  equity and or fair value methods of accounting 
of this amount  million relates to our investments in terrestar networks and terrestar corporation  which are accounted for under the fair value method 
terrestar networks and terrestar corporation filed for bankruptcy protection under the us bankruptcy code on october  and february   respectively 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of these debt and equity instruments would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of these investments 
the remaining amount of our other investment securities portfolio of million is accounted for under the cost and or equity methods of accounting 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of these debt and equity instruments would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of these investments 
our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded depends on the success of those companies businesses and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans 
because private markets are not as liquid as public markets  there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments  or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them 
long term debt as of december   we had million of long term debt  of which million represented our capital lease obligations  which are not subject to fair value disclosure requirements 
derivative financial instruments in general  we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes  but we may do so in the future
