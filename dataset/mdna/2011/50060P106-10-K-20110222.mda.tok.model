table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading integrated global provider of carbon compounds and commercial wood treatment products and services 
our products are used in a variety of niche applications in a diverse range of end markets  including the aluminum  railroad  specialty chemical  utility  rubber  concrete and steel industries 
we serve our customers through a comprehensive global manufacturing and distribution network  with manufacturing facilities located in the united states  australia  china  the united kingdom  denmark and the netherlands 
we operate two principal businesses carbon materials chemicals cm c and railroad utility products r up 
through our cm c business  we process coal tar into a variety of products  including carbon pitch  creosote  naphthalene and phthalic anhydride  which are intermediate materials necessary in the production of aluminum  the pressure treatment of wood  the production of high strength concrete  and the production of plasticizers and specialty chemicals  respectively 
through our r up business  we believe that we are the largest supplier of railroad crossties to the north american railroads 
our other commercial wood treatment products include the provision of utility poles to the electric and telephone utility industries 
our cm c business has entered into a number of strategic transactions during the last year to expand and focus on its core business related to coal tar distillation and derived products 
in march  we completed the acquisition of cindu chemicals bv  a coal tar distillation company located in the netherlands 
this company was subsequently renamed koppers netherlands bv koppers netherlands 
the revenues from this facility from march through december  amounted to approximately million 
in october we also purchased the midwestern united states refined tar business of stella jones inc to increase our presence in this market 
our r up business purchased the rail joint bar business of portec rail products  inc located in huntington  west virginia in december this acquisition strengthens our product portfolio offerings to our existing class i and commercial railroad customers in the united states 
on october   we sold our percent interest in koppers monessen partners lp monessen to arcelormittal sa for cash of million plus working capital of million 
net cash proceeds  after deduction for the limited partner interest  taxes and transaction costs  were approximately million 
monessen is a metallurgical furnace coke facility 
effective as of the end of the second quarter of  monessen was classified as a discontinued operation in the company s statement of operations 
outlook trend overview our businesses and results of operations are impacted by various competitive and other factors including i the impact of global economic conditions on demand for our products both in the united states and overseas  ii raw materials pricing and availability  in particular the amount and quality of coal tar available in global markets  which could be negatively impacted by reductions in steel production  iii volatility in oil prices  which impacts selling prices and margins for certain of our products including carbon black feedstock and phthalic anhydride  iv competitive conditions in global carbon pitch markets  and v changes in foreign exchange rates 
our businesses and results of operations were impacted by the global recession starting in late and continuing through certain key end markets experienced significant global reductions in demand that has negatively affected the profitability of our products 
during our key end markets showed increased stability for our carbon materials chemicals business  however  volumes for our railroad utility products business declined substantially from levels as our class i railroad customer base reduced their purchases 
during we saw the idling or closure of several aluminum smelters  particularly in north america and europe  as global production of aluminum declined over previous levels 
however  in late several north american smelters announced that they are planning to increase production and restart some of their previously idled capacity during we also believe we are well positioned to supply the new middle eastern smelters due to our capacity expansions in china 

table of contents koppers holdings inc annual report while our volumes of carbon pitch have increased as our chinese operations supply several of the new smelters in the middle east  profit margins in this region have been reduced as coal tar costs have increased in response to reduced availability and higher oil prices  and carbon pitch pricing has been negatively affected by excess supplies of product in asia 
our carbon black facility in australia experienced operating problems related to a boiler in that had a negative impact on operating profit of approximately million for the year ended december  our railroad business was down substantially in from an unusually strong prior year as we believe the railroads reduced their untreated crosstie purchases and treating volumes in order to reduce inventory levels 
we produced lower volumes in and as compared to in many of our products which reduced the capacity utilization at our facilities 
lower throughput volumes combined with increasing pressure for price reductions has led us to review our capacity utilization and has resulted in production cutbacks  from time to time  at certain facilities  which can result in lower margins 
to the extent these trends continue  we may temporarily idle or permanently close facilities 
for example  in december we announced the sale of our gainesville utility pole treatment plant  and in the fourth quarter of we recorded impairment and related charges of million related to a wood treating plant in the united states 
utility pole markets are expected to continue to remain competitive with resulting low margins 
we will continue to review underperforming assets and rationalize capacity as necessary to remain competitive in this market and will reduce market share if warranted 
several of our products  particularly carbon black feedstock and phthalic anhydride  have end market pricing that is linked to oil 
during the past few years we have benefited in terms of revenues and profitability from the higher pricing for these products as the cost of coal tar has not increased proportionally with oil 
however  when the price of oil declined in late we saw significant price and profit declines for these products 
the availability of our key raw material  coal tar  is linked to levels of metallurgical coke production 
as the global steel industry has reduced production of steel and metallurgical coke the volumes of coal tar by product were also reduced 
our ability to obtain coal tar and the price we are able to negotiate have a significant impact on the level of profitability of our business 
many of our sales contracts include provisions that allow for price increases based on increases in the price of raw materials  which has allowed us to generally maintain profit dollars in our core businesses 
however  significant increases in raw material costs will result in margin dilution because only the increased cost of the raw material is passed on to the customer 
additionally  in certain regions such as china that have competing markets for coal tar  we may not be able to recover raw material cost increases in the selling prices of all of our end products 
seasonality and effects of weather on operations our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors that are outside of our control  including inclement weather conditions  which in the past have affected operating results 
operations at several facilities have been halted for short periods of time during the winter months 
moreover  demand for some of our products declines during periods of inclement weather 
as a result of the foregoing  we anticipate that we may experience material fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
historically  our operating results have been significantly lower in the fourth and first calendar quarters as compared to the second and third calendar quarters 
we expect this seasonality trend to continue in future periods 

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended december  and december  consolidated results net sales for the years ended december  and are summarized by segment in the following table year ended december  net change dollars in millions carbon materials chemicals railroad utility products cm c net sales increased by million or percent due to the following changes in volume  pricing and foreign exchange price volume foreign exchange net change carbon materials a distillates b coal tar chemicals c other d total cm c a includes carbon pitch  petroleum pitch and refined tar 
b includes creosote and carbon black feedstock 
c includes naphthalene and phthalic anhydride 
d includes carbon black  benzole  freight and other products 
carbon materials pricing for carbon pitch decreased five percent due to lower demand and excess pitch availability 
offsetting this decrease were higher sales volumes of carbon pitch from chinese operations of five percent and europe of three percent due primarily to the acquisition in the netherlands 
the volume increases are due to increased worldwide demand for aluminum products and the increased production from our chinese operations to supply carbon pitch to smelters in the middle east 
distillate pricing for carbon black feedstock increased two percent in europe due to higher average worldwide oil prices as compared to the prior year 
the increase in distillate sales volume is due to the acquisition in the netherlands 
for coal tar chemicals  increases in phthalic anhydride prices in the us of three percent and naphthalene prices of one percent were experienced 
higher volumes of phthalic anhydride of one percent resulted from increased production in the us auto industry  and higher volumes of naphthalene of one percent were due to the acquisition in the netherlands 
with respect to other products  pricing for benzole increased one percent as compared to the prior year

we record long lived assets at the lower of cost or fair value  with fair value based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows 
since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of fixed assets  there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated 

table of contents goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment at least on an annual basis 
in making this assessment  management relies on various factors  including operating results  estimated future cash flows  and business plans 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in our management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
because management s judgment is involved in performing goodwill impairment analyses  there is risk that the carrying value of goodwill is overstated 
goodwill valuations are performed using an average of actual and projected operating results of the relevant reporting units 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods 
additionally  disruptions to our business such as prolonged recessionary periods or unexpected significant declines in operating results of the relevant reporting units could result in charges for goodwill and other asset impairments in future periods 
deferred tax assets 
at december  our balance sheet included million of deferred tax assets  net of an million valuation allowance 
we have determined that this valuation allowance is required for our deferred tax assets based on future earnings projections 
to the extent that we encounter unexpected difficulties in market conditions  adverse changes in regulations affecting our businesses and operations  adverse outcomes in legal and environmental matters  or any other unfavorable conditions  the projections for future taxable income may be overstated and we may be required to record an increase in the valuation allowance related to these deferred tax assets which could have a material adverse effect on income in the future 
accrued insurance 
we are insured for property  casualty and workers compensation insurance up to various stop loss amounts after meeting required retention levels 
losses are accrued based upon estimates of the liability for the related retentions for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on our experience 
in the event we incur a significant number of losses beyond the coverage retention limits  additional expense beyond the actuarial projections would be required 
asset retirement obligations 
we measure asset retirement obligations based upon the applicable accounting guidance  using certain assumptions including estimates regarding the recovery of residues in storage tanks 
in the event that operational or regulatory issues vary from our estimates  we could incur additional significant charges to income and increases in cash expenditures related to the disposal of those residues 
pension and postretirement benefits 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided far into the future and allocating that cost over the time period each employee works 
this calculation requires extensive use of assumptions regarding inflation  investment returns  mortality  medical costs  employee turnover and discount rates 
in determining the expected return on plan assets assumptions  we evaluate long term actual return information  the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and estimates of future investment returns 
in selecting rates for current and long term health care assumptions  we take into consideration a number of factors including our actual health care cost increases  the design of our benefit programs  the characteristics of our active and retiree populations and expectations of inflation rates 
because these items require our management s judgment  the related liabilities currently recorded by us could be lower or higher than amounts ultimately required to be paid 
litigation and contingencies 
we record liabilities related to legal matters when an adverse outcome is probable and reasonably estimable 
to the extent we anticipate favorable outcomes to these matters which ultimately result in adverse outcomes  we could incur material adverse impacts on earnings and cash flows 
because such matters require significant judgments on the part of management  the recorded liabilities could be lower than what is ultimately required 
environmental liabilities 
we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations and potential liabilities relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety  including  among other things  the cleanup of contaminated sites  the treatment  storage and disposal of wastes  the discharge of effluent into waterways  the emission of substances into the air and various health and safety matters 
we expect to incur substantial costs for ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations 
we may also incur costs as a result of governmental or third party claims  or otherwise incur costs  relating to cleanup of  or for injuries resulting from  contamination at sites associated with past and present operations 
we accrue for environmental liabilities when a determination can be made that they are probable and reasonably estimable 

table of contents koppers holdings inc annual report item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk like other global companies  we are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the objective of our financial risk management is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our earnings  cash flows and equity 
to manage the interest rate risks  we use a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
this reduces the impact of short term fluctuations in interest rates 
to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks  we enter into foreign currency debt instruments that are held by our foreign subsidiaries 
this reduces the impact of fluctuating currencies on net income and equity 
we also use forward exchange contracts to hedge firm commitments up to twelve months and all such contracts are marked to market with the recognition of a gain or loss at each reporting period 
the following analyses present the sensitivity of the market value  earnings and cash flows of our financial instruments and foreign operations to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates as if these changes occurred at december  and the range of changes chosen for these analyses reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the interest rate and exchange rate assumptions 
these forward looking statements are selective in nature and only address the potential impacts from financial instruments and foreign operations 
they do not include other potential effects that could impact our business as a result of these changes 
interest rate and debt sensitivity analysis 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations 
we have fixed variable rate debt and the ability to incur variable rate debt under the koppers inccredit agreement 
at december  we had million of fixed rate debt and at december   we had million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt 
our ratio of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at december  was approximately percent 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
holding other variables constant such as debt levels and foreign exchange rates  a one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december  and would have increased the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million and million  respectively 
exchange rate sensitivity analysis 
our exchange rate exposures result primarily from our investment and ongoing operations in australia  denmark  china and the united kingdom 
holding other variables constant  if there were a ten percent reduction in all relevant exchange rates  the effect on our earnings  based on actual earnings from foreign operations for the years ended december  and  would be reductions of approximately million and million  respectively
