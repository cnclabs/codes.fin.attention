recent developments re domestication to ireland in february  our board of directors approved a plan for us to re domesticate from the cayman islands to ireland 
at a special shareholders meeting held on may   our shareholders approved the re domestication proposal pursuant to which all united america indemnity  ltd 
ordinary shares would be cancelled and all holders of such shares would receive ordinary shares of global indemnity plc  a newly formed irish company  on a one for two basis 
the re domestication transaction was completed on july   following approval from the grand court of the cayman islands  at which time global indemnity plc replaced united america indemnity  ltd 
as the ultimate parent company  and united america indemnity  ltd 
became a wholly owned subsidiary of global indemnity plc 
shares of united america indemnity  ltd 
previously traded on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol indm 
shares of the irish company  global indemnity plc  began trading on the nasdaq global select market on july  under the symbol gbli 
profit enhancement initiative on november   we committed to a profit enhancement initiative with respect to our us insurance operations 
the plan was initiated on november   and is part of our efforts to streamline our operations in response to the continuing impact of the domestic recession as well as the competitive landscape within the excess and surplus lines market 
as part of this initiative  the company intended to enhance profitability and earnings through reducing its us based census by approximately  closing underperforming us facilities  and supplementing staffing in bermuda and in ireland 
all action items relating to this initiative were implemented by december  the total cost of implementing this initiative was recorded in our consolidated statements of operations within our insurance operations segment in the fourth quarter of components of the initiative included employee termination and severance charges of million  expenses of million relating to discontinuing use of leased office space  net of sublease income  restructuring expenses of million for related asset and leasehold improvement impairments  and expenses of million relating to the curtailment of our workers compensation product initiative  consisting of a minimum ceded premium charge of on our workers compensation reinsurance treaty and million in asset impairments 
we project that this restructuring plan will result in annual savings beginning in of approximately million to million on a pre tax basis  although there can be no assurance that all of these savings will be realized

new zealand earthquake on february   an earthquake struck christchurch  new zealand 
given the magnitude and recent occurrence of this event  there is a lack of data available from industry participants resulting in significant uncertainty with respect to potential insured losses  and as a result  the company s potential losses from this event 
while we are still evaluating the potential loss  our current estimate is approximately million 
actual losses from this event may vary materially from our current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties resulting from several factors  including the preliminary nature of the loss data available and potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided 
japan earthquake and tsunami on march   an earthquake and resultant tsunami struck off the northeast coast of japan 
given the magnitude and recent occurrence of this event  there is a lack of data available from industry participants resulting in significant uncertainty with respect to potential insured losses  and as a result  the company s potential losses from this event 
we are evaluating our exposure to loss from this event and have not determined an initial estimate 
overview our insurance operations distribute property and casualty insurance products through a group of approximately professional general agencies that have limited quoting and binding authority  as well as a number of wholesale insurance brokers who in turn sell our insurance products to insureds through retail insurance brokers 
we operate predominantly in the excess and surplus lines marketplace 
to manage our operations  we differentiate them by product classification 
these product classifications are penn america  which includes property and general liability products for small commercial businesses distributed through a select network of wholesale general agents with specific binding authority  united national  which includes property  general liability  and professional lines products distributed through program administrators with specific binding authority  and diamond state  which includes property  casualty  and professional lines products distributed through wholesale brokers and program administrators with specific binding authority 

table of contents our reinsurance operations are comprised of the operations of wind river reinsurance  a bermuda based treaty reinsurer of excess and surplus lines and specialty property and casualty insurance 
we derive our revenues primarily from premiums paid on insurance policies that we write and from income generated by our investment portfolio  net of fees paid for investment management services 
the amount of insurance premiums that we receive is a function of the amount and type of policies we write  as well as of prevailing market prices 
our expenses include losses and loss adjustment expenses  acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses  corporate and other operating expenses  interest  other investment expenses  and income taxes 
losses and loss adjustment expenses are estimated by management and reflect our best estimate of ultimate losses and costs arising during the reporting period and revisions of prior period estimates 
we record losses and loss adjustment expenses based on an actuarial analysis of the estimated losses we expect to incur on the insurance policies we write 
the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses will depend on the actual costs to resolve claims 
acquisition costs consist principally of commissions that are typically a percentage of the premiums on the insurance policies we write  net of ceding commissions earned from reinsurers and allocated internal costs 
other underwriting expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses and general operating expenses 
corporate and other operating expenses are comprised primarily of outside legal fees  other professional fees  including accounting fees  directors fees  management fees  salaries and benefits for company personnel whose services relate to the support of corporate activities  and capital duty taxes incurred 
interest expense consists primarily of interest on senior notes payable  junior subordinated debentures  and funds held on behalf of others 
critical accounting estimates and policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of part ii of this report 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and estimation 
liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses although variability is inherent in estimates  we believe that the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses reflects our best estimate for future amounts needed to pay losses and related loss adjustment expenses and the impact of our reinsurance coverages with respect to insured events 
in developing loss and loss adjustment expense loss or losses reserve estimates for our insurance operations  our actuaries perform detailed reserve analyses each quarter 
to perform the analysis  the data is organized at a reserve category level 
a reserve category can be a line of business such as commercial automobile liability  or it can be a particular type of claim such as construction defect 
the reserves within a reserve category level are characterized as short tail through long tail 
most of our business can be characterized as medium to long tail 
for long tail business  it will generally be several years between the time the business is written and the time when all claims are settled 
our long tail exposures include general liability  professional liability  products liability  commercial automobile liability  and excess and umbrella 
short tail exposures include property  commercial automobile physical damage  and equine mortality 
to manage our insurance operations  we differentiate them by product classifications  which are penn america  united national  and diamond state 
for further discussion about our product classifications  see general our insurance operations in item of part i of this report 
each of our product classifications contain both long tail and short tail exposures 
every reserve category is analyzed by our actuaries each quarter 
the analyses generally include reviews of losses gross of reinsurance and net of reinsurance 
in addition to our internal reserve analysis  independent external actuaries performed a detailed review of our reserves for the second and fourth quarters of we do not rely upon the review by the independent actuaries to develop our reserves  however  the data is used to corroborate the analysis performed by the in house actuarial staff 

table of contents loss reserve estimates for our reinsurance operations are developed by independent  external actuaries 
the data for this analysis is organized by treaty and treaty year 
as with our reserves for our insurance operations  reserves for our reinsurance operations are characterized as short tail through long tail 
most of our business can be characterized as medium to long tail 
long tail exposures include workers compensation  professional liability  and excess and umbrella liability 
short tail exposures are primarily catastrophe exposed property accounts 
every treaty is reviewed each quarter  both gross and net of reinsurance 
the methods used to project ultimate losses for both long tail and short tail exposures include  but are not limited to  the following paid development method  incurred development method  expected loss ratio method  bornhuetter ferguson method using premiums and paid loss  bornhuetter ferguson method using premiums and incurred loss  and average loss method 
the paid development method estimates ultimate losses by reviewing paid loss patterns and applying them to accident years with further expected changes in paid loss 
selection of the paid loss pattern requires analysis of several factors including the impact of inflation on claims costs  the rate at which claims professionals make claim payments and close claims  the impact of judicial decisions  the impact of underwriting changes  the impact of large claim payments and other factors 
claim cost inflation itself requires evaluation of changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property  changes in the cost of medical care  changes in the cost of wage replacement  judicial decisions  legislative changes and other factors 
because this method assumes that losses are paid at a consistent rate  changes in any of these factors can impact the results 
since the method does not rely on case reserves  it is not directly influenced by changes in the adequacy of case reserves 
for many reserve categories  paid loss data for recent periods may be too immature or erratic for accurate predictions 
this situation often exists for long tail exposures 
in addition  changes in the factors described above may result in inconsistent payment patterns 
finally  estimating the paid loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available in the data analyzed often involves considerable uncertainty for long tail reserve categories 
the incurred development method is similar to the paid development method  but it uses case incurred losses instead of paid losses 
since this method uses more data case reserves in addition to paid losses than the paid development method  the incurred development patterns may be less variable than paid development patterns 
however  selection of the incurred loss pattern requires analysis of all of the factors listed in the description of the paid development method 
in addition  the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place and the use of case incurred losses may not eliminate the issues associated with estimating the incurred loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available 
the expected loss ratio method multiplies premiums by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate loss estimates for each accident year 
this method may be useful if loss development patterns are inconsistent  losses emerge very slowly  or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses 
the selection of the expected loss ratio requires analysis of loss ratios from earlier accident years or pricing studies and analysis of inflationary trends  frequency trends  rate changes  underwriting changes  and other applicable factors 
the bornhuetter ferguson method using premiums and paid losses is a combination of the paid development method and the expected loss ratio method 
this method normally determines expected loss ratios similar to the method used for the expected loss ratio method and requires analysis of the same factors described above 
the method assumes that only future losses will develop at the expected loss ratio level 
the percent of paid loss to ultimate loss implied from the paid development method is used to determine what percentage of ultimate loss is yet to be paid 
the use of the pattern from the paid development method requires consideration of all factors listed in the description of the paid development method 
the estimate of losses yet to be paid is added to current paid 
table of contents losses to estimate the ultimate loss for each year 
this method will react very slowly if actual ultimate loss ratios are different from expectations due to changes not accounted for by the expected loss ratio calculation 
the bornhuetter ferguson method using premiums and incurred losses is similar to the bornhuetter ferguson method using premiums and paid losses except that it uses case incurred losses 
the use of case incurred losses instead of paid losses can result in development patterns that are less variable than paid development patterns 
however  the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place  and the method requires analysis of all the factors that need to be reviewed for the expected loss ratio and incurred development methods 
the average loss method multiplies a projected number of ultimate claims by an estimated ultimate average loss for each accident year to produce ultimate loss estimates 
since projections of the ultimate number of claims are often less variable than projections of ultimate loss  this method can provide more reliable results for reserve categories where loss development patterns are inconsistent or too variable to be relied on exclusively 
in addition  this method can more directly account for changes in coverage that impact the number and size of claims 
however  this method can be difficult to apply to situations where very large claims or a substantial number of unusual claims result in volatile average claim sizes 
projecting the ultimate number of claims requires analysis of several factors including the rate at which policyholders report claims to us  the impact of judicial decisions  the impact of underwriting changes and other factors 
estimating the ultimate average loss requires analysis of the impact of large losses and claim cost trends based on changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property  changes in the cost of medical care  changes in the cost of wage replacement  judicial decisions  legislative changes and other factors 
for many exposures  especially those that can be considered long tail  a particular accident year may not have a sufficient volume of paid losses to produce a statistically reliable estimate of ultimate losses 
in such a case  our actuaries typically assign more weight to the incurred development method than to the paid development method 
as claims continue to settle and the volume of paid losses increases  the actuaries may assign additional weight to the paid development method 
for most of our reserve categories  even the incurred losses for accident years that are early in the claim settlement process will not be of sufficient volume to produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses 
in these cases  we will not assign any weight to the paid and incurred development methods and will use the bornhuetter ferguson and expected loss ratio methods 
for short tail exposures  the paid and incurred development methods can often be relied on sooner primarily because our history includes a sufficient number of years to cover the entire period over which paid and incurred losses are expected to change 
however  we may also use the expected loss ratio  bornhuetter ferguson and average loss methods for short tail exposures 
generally  reserves for long tail lines use the expected loss ratio method for the most recent accident year  shift to the bornhuetter ferguson methods for the next two years  and then shift to the incurred and or paid development method 
claims related to umbrella business are usually reported later than claims for other long tail lines 
for umbrella business  the expected loss ratio and bornhuetter ferguson methods are used for as many as six years before shifting to the incurred development method 
reserves for short tail lines use the bornhuetter ferguson methods for the most recent accident year and shift to the incurred and or paid development method in subsequent years 
for other more complex reserve categories where the above methods may not produce reliable indications  we use additional methods tailored to the characteristics of the specific situation 
such reserve categories include losses from construction defects and a e 
for construction defect losses  our actuaries organize losses by the year in which they were reported 
to estimate losses from claims that have not been reported  various extrapolation techniques are applied to the pattern of claims that have been reported to estimate the number of claims yet to be reported 
this process requires analysis of several factors including the rate at which policyholders report claims to us  the impact of judicial decisions  the impact of underwriting changes and other factors 
an average claim size is determined from past experience and applied to the number of unreported claims to estimate reserves for these claims 
establishing reserves for a e and other mass tort claims involves considerably more judgment than other types of claims due to  among other things  inconsistent court decisions  an increase in bankruptcy filings as a result of asbestos related liabilities  and judicial interpretations that often expand theories of recovery and broaden the scope of coverage 
the insurance industry continues to receive a substantial number of asbestos related bodily 
table of contents injury claims  with an increasing focus being directed toward other parties  including installers of products containing asbestos rather than against asbestos manufacturers 
this shift has resulted in significant insurance coverage litigation implicating applicable coverage defenses or determinations  if any  including but not limited to  determinations as to whether or not an asbestos related bodily injury claim is subject to aggregate limits of liability found in most comprehensive general liability policies 
in response to these continuing developments  management increased gross and net a e reserves during the second quarter of to reflect its best estimate of a e exposures 
in  one of our insurance companies was dismissed from a lawsuit seeking coverage from it and other unrelated insurance companies 
the suit involved issues related to approximately  existing asbestos related bodily injury claims and future claims 
the dismissal was the result of a settlement of a disputed claim related to accident year the settlement is conditioned upon certain legal events occurring which will trigger financial obligations by the insurance company 
management will continue to monitor the developments of the litigation to determine if any additional financial exposure is present 
reserve analyses performed by our internal and external actuaries result in actuarial point estimates 
the results of the detailed reserve reviews were summarized and discussed with our senior management to determine the best estimate of reserves 
this group considered many factors in making this decision 
the factors included  but were not limited to  the historical pattern and volatility of the actuarial indications  the sensitivity of the actuarial indications to changes in paid and incurred loss patterns  the consistency of claims handling processes  the consistency of case reserving practices  changes in our pricing and underwriting  and overall pricing and underwriting trends in the insurance market 
management s best estimate at december  was recorded as the loss reserve 
management s best estimate is as of a particular point in time and is based upon known facts  our actuarial analyses  current law  and our judgment 
this resulted in carried gross and net reserves of  million and million  respectively  as of december  a breakout of our gross and net reserves  excluding the effects of our intercompany pooling arrangements and intercompany stop loss and quota share reinsurance agreements  as of december  is as follows gross reserves dollars in thousands case ibnr total insurance operations reinsurance operations total net reserves dollars in thousands case ibnr total insurance operations reinsurance operations total losses incurred but not reported  including the expected future emergence of case reserves 
does not include reinsurance receivable on paid losses 
we continually review these estimates and  based on new developments and information  we include adjustments of the estimated ultimate liability in the operating results for the periods in which the adjustments are made 
the establishment of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves makes no provision for the possible broadening of coverage by legislative action or judicial interpretation  or the emergence of new types of losses not sufficiently represented in our historical experience or that cannot yet be quantified or estimated 
we regularly analyze our reserves and review pricing and reserving methodologies so that future adjustments to prior year reserves can be minimized 
however  given the complexity of this process  reserves require continual updates and the ultimate liability may be higher or lower than previously indicated 
changes in estimates for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are recorded in the period that the change in these estimates is made 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for details concerning the changes in the estimate for incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses related to prior accident years 

table of contents the detailed reserve analyses that our internal and external actuaries complete use a variety of generally accepted actuarial methods and techniques to produce a number of estimates of ultimate loss 
we determine our best estimate of ultimate loss by reviewing the various estimates and assigning weight to each estimate given the characteristics of the reserve category being reviewed 
the reserve estimate is the difference between the estimated ultimate loss and the losses paid to date 
the difference between the estimated ultimate loss and the case incurred loss paid loss plus case reserve is considered to be ibnr 
ibnr calculated as such includes a provision for development on known cases supplemental development as well as a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported pure ibnr 
in light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels  we review our reserve estimates on a regular basis and make adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined 
the anticipated future loss emergence continues to be reflective of historical patterns  and the selected development patterns have not changed significantly from those underlying our most recent analyses 
the key assumptions fundamental to the reserving process are often different for various reserve categories and accident years 
some of these assumptions are explicit assumptions that are required of a particular method  but most of the assumptions are implicit and cannot be precisely quantified 
an example of an explicit assumption is the pattern employed in the paid development method 
however  the assumed pattern is itself based on several implicit assumptions such as the impact of inflation on medical costs and the rate at which claim professionals close claims 
loss frequency is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure  and loss severity is a measure of the average size of claims 
each reserve segment has an implicit frequency and severity for each accident year as a result of the various assumptions made 
previous reserve analyses have resulted in our identification of information and trends that have caused us to increase or decrease our frequency and severity assumptions in prior periods and could lead to the identification of a need for additional material changes in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  which could materially affect our results of operations  equity  business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings 
factors affecting loss frequency include  among other things  the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns 
factors affecting loss severity include  among other things  changes in policy limits and deductibles  rate of inflation and judicial interpretations 
another factor affecting estimates of loss frequency and severity is the loss reporting lag  which is the period of time between the occurrence of a loss and the date the loss is reported to us 
the length of the loss reporting lag affects our ability to accurately predict loss frequency loss frequencies are more predictable for short tail lines as well as the amount of reserves needed for ibnr 
if the actual levels of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected  the ultimate losses will be different than management s best estimate 
for most of our reserving classes  we believe that frequency can be predicted with greater accuracy than severity 
therefore  we believe management s best estimate is more sensitive to changes in severity than frequency 
the following table  which we believe reflects a reasonable range of variability around our best estimate based on our historical loss experience and management s judgment  reflects the impact of changes which could be favorable or unfavorable in frequency and severity on our current accident year net loss estimate of million for claims occurring during the year ended december  severity change dollars in thousands frequency change 
table of contents our net reserves for losses and loss expenses of million as of december  relate to multiple accident years 
therefore  the impact of changes in frequency and severity for more than one accident year could be higher or lower than the amounts reflected above 
recoverability of reinsurance receivables we regularly review the collectability of our reinsurance receivables  and we include adjustments resulting from this review in earnings in the period in which the adjustment arises 
am best ratings  financial history  available collateral  and payment history with the reinsurers are several of the factors that we consider when judging collectability 
changes in loss reserves can also affect the valuation of reinsurance receivables if the change is related to loss reserves that are ceded to reinsurers 
certain amounts may be uncollectible if our reinsurers dispute a loss or if the reinsurer is unable to pay 
if our reinsurers do not pay  we are still legally obligated to pay the loss 
at december   our reinsurance receivables were million  net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance receivables of million 
at december   the company held collateral securing its reinsurance receivables of million 
reinsurance receivables  net of collateral held  were million at december  for a listing of the ten reinsurers for which we have the largest reinsurance asset amounts as of december   see reinsurance of underwriting risk in item of part i of this report 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for more details concerning the collectability of our reinsurance receivables 
investments the carrying amount of our investments approximates their estimated fair value 
we regularly perform various analytical valuation procedures with respect to investments  including reviewing each fixed maturity security in an unrealized loss position to determine the amount of unrealized loss related to credit loss and the amount related to all other factors  such as changes in interest rates 
the credit loss represents the portion of the amortized book value in excess of the net present value of the projected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the debt security prior to impairment 
the credit loss component of the other than temporary impairment is recorded through earnings  whereas the amount relating to factors other than credit losses are recorded in other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
during our review  we consider credit rating  market price  and issuer specific financial information  among other factors  to assess the likelihood of collection of all principal and interest as contractually due 
securities for which we determine that a credit loss is likely are subjected to further analysis to estimate the credit loss to be recognized in earnings  if any 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for the specific methodologies and significant assumptions used by asset class 
upon identification of such securities and periodically thereafter  a detailed review is performed to determine whether the decline is considered other than temporary 
this review includes an analysis of several factors  including but not limited to  the credit ratings and cash flows of the securities  and the magnitude and length of time that the fair value of such securities is below cost 
for an analysis of our securities with gross unrealized losses as of december  and  and for other than temporary impairment losses that we recorded for the years ended december    and  please see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
fair value measurements we categorize our assets that are accounted for at fair value in the consolidated statements into a fair value hierarchy 
the fair value hierarchy is directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs utilized to determine the fair value of these assets 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for further information about the fair value hierarchy and our assets that are accounted for at fair value 
goodwill and intangible assets during  the gross written premium of penn america declined and the company s and certain of its competitors market values declined  indicating that goodwill and other intangible assets might be impaired 
after 
table of contents testing  the company concluded that impairment of goodwill and partial impairment of the intangible assets related to the merger with penn america group  inc was necessary 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million  net of tax  in the fourth quarter of related to the company s merger with penn america group  inc the impairment charge of million is comprised of a goodwill impairment of million  an impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets of million pre tax  million after tax  and an impairment of definite lived intangible assets of million pre tax  million after tax 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for details concerning the goodwill and intangible asset testing related to during there were no changes to goodwill which was fully impaired in there were no impairments to indefinite lived or definite lived intangible assets 
the balance of definite lived intangible assets related to the merger with the penn america group  inc of million  net of accumulated amortization  amortized fully in in april  the company recorded goodwill of million and intangible assets of million as a result of an acquisition 
the acquisition was recorded as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
the intangible assets were comprised of trademarks  customer relationships  and non compete agreements 
the trademarks were determined to be indefinite lived and are not subject to amortization 
the customer relationships and non compete agreements were determined to be definite lived and will be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the customer relationships will be amortized over fifteen years  and the non compete agreements will be amortized over two years 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for details concerning the acquisition 
taxation we provide for income taxes in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
at each balance sheet date  management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a valuation allowance would be based on all available information including our assessment of uncertain tax positions and projections of future taxable income from each tax paying component in each jurisdiction  principally derived from business plans and available tax planning strategies 
there are no valuation allowances as of december  the deferred tax asset balance is analyzed regularly by management 
based on these analyses  we have determined that our deferred tax asset is recoverable 
projections of future taxable income incorporate several assumptions of future business and operations that are apt to differ from actual experience 
if  in the future  our assumptions and estimates that resulted in our forecast of future taxable income for each tax paying component prove to be incorrect  a valuation allowance may be required 
this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
in  we recognized million of investment income related to the liquidation of investments in two limited partnerships 
our tax provision includes federal income tax expense of million related to this investment income 
we apply a more likely than not recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties  only allowing the recognition of those tax benefits that have a greater than likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
please see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for a discussion of our tax uncertainties

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of economic losses due to adverse changes in the estimated fair value of a financial instrument as the result of changes in interest rates  equity prices  credit risk  illiquidity  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
our consolidated balance sheet includes the estimated fair values of assets that are subject to market risk 
our primary market risks are interest rate risk and credit risks associated with investments in fixed maturities  equity price risk associated with investments in equity securities  and foreign exchange risk associated with premium received that is denominated in foreign currencies 
each of these risks is discussed in more detail below 
we have no commodity risk 
interest rate risk our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
our fixed income investments are exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed income investments fall  and the converse is also true 
we seek to manage interest rate risk through an active portfolio management strategy that involves the selection  by our managers  of investments with appropriate characteristics  such as duration  yield  currency  and liquidity that are tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our liabilities 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk also includes maintaining a high quality bond portfolio with a relatively short duration to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value 
a significant portion of our investment portfolio matures each year  allowing for reinvestment at current market rates 
as of december   assuming identical shifts in interest rates for securities of all maturities  the table below illustrates the sensitivity of market value in global indemnity s bonds to selected hypothetical changes in basis point increases and decreases change in dollars in thousands market value basis point change market value no change credit risk we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income investments as well as corporate loans 
with the exception of corporate loans  our investment policy requires that we invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the rating of the security 
our corporate loan portfolio is subject to default risk since these investments are typically below investment grade 
to mitigate this risk  our investment managers perform an in depth structural analysis 
as part of this analysis  they focus on the strength of any security granted to the lenders  the position of the loan in the company s capital structure and the appropriate covenant protection 
in addition  as part of our risk control  our investment managers maintain appropriate portfolio diversification by limiting issuer and industry exposure 
as of december   we had approximately million worth of investment exposure to subprime and alt a investments 
as of december   approximately million of those investments have been rated aaa by standard poor s  million were rated bbb to aa  and million were rated below investment 
table of contents grade 
as of december   the company had approximately million worth of investment exposure to subprime and alt a investments 
of that amount  approximately million have been rated aaa by standard poor s  million were rated bbb to aa  and million were rated below investment grade 
impairments on these investments were million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  we have credit risk exposure to our general agencies and reinsurers 
we seek to mitigate and control our risks to producers by typically requiring our general agencies to render payments within no more than days after the month in which a policy is effective and including provisions within our general agency contracts that allow us to terminate a general agency s authority in the event of non payment 
with respect to our credit exposure to reinsurers  we seek to mitigate and control our risk by ceding business to only those reinsurers having adequate financial strength and sufficient capital to fund their obligation 
in addition  we seek to mitigate credit risk to reinsurers through the use of trusts and letters of credit for collateral 
as of december   million of collateral and million in letters of credit were held in trust to support the reinsurance receivables 
equity price risk in  the strategy for our equity portfolio followed a large cap value approach 
this investment style will place primary emphasis on selecting the best relative values from those issues having a projected normalized price earnings ratio at a discount to the market multiple 
we compare the results of our equity portfolio to a s p citigroup excluding p c insurers  multi line insurers and investment banks brokers index 
to protect against equity price risk  the sector exposures within our equity portfolio closely correlate to the sector exposures within the custom benchmark index 
in  our common stock portfolio had a return of  not including investment advisor fees  compared to the benchmark return of 
the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risk are based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet dates 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and thus the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of an equity security results from perceived changes in the underlying economic makeup of a stock  the price of alternative investments and overall market conditions 
we attempt to mitigate our unsystematic risk  which is the risk that is associated with holding a particular security  by holding a large number of securities in that market 
at year end  no security represented more than of the market value of the equity portfolio 
we continue to have systematic risk  which is the risk inherent in the general market due to broad macroeconomic factors that affect all companies in the market 
as of december   the table below summarizes our equity price risk and reflects the effect of a hypothetical and increase or decrease in market prices 
the selected hypothetical changes do not indicate what could be the potential best or worst scenarios 
hypothetical estimated fair value percentage increase dollars in thousands after hypothetical decrease in hypothetical price change change in prices shareholders equity no change net of tax 
table of contents foreign currency exchange risk we have foreign currency exchange risk associated with a portion of the business written at wind river reinsurance  as well as a small portion of expenses related to corporate overhead in our ireland office 
we generally keep premiums received in non us currencies in their respective original currencies until there is greater certainty of net profits under individual reinsurance contracts  at which time we convert some of those original currencies into us dollars 
we also maintain cash accounts in foreign currencies in order to pay international expenses 
at period end  we re measure those non us currency assets to their current non us dollar equivalent 
corresponding financial liabilities  if any  are adjusted within the reserving process 
if liabilities exceed assets  we intend to purchase the relevant non us currencies at the prevailing rates in order to minimize the impact of foreign exchange risk to our operations
