item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview arlington asset investment corp 
is a principal investment firm that acquires and holds mortgage related and other assets 
we acquire  on a leveraged basis  residential mortgage backed securities mbs  either issued by a us government agency  or guaranteed as to principal and interest by us government agencies or us government sponsored entities agency backed mbs 
we also acquire mbs issued by private organizations private label mbs subject to maintaining our exemption from regulation as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended act 
when we use the terms arlington asset  aaic  we us our and the company  we mean arlington asset investment corp 
and its consolidated subsidiaries 
we are taxed as a c corporation for federal income tax purposes 
we operate primarily in the united states 
business environment our mbs portfolio is affected by general us residential real estate market conditions and the overall us economic environment 
in particular  our mbs strategy and the performance of our mbs portfolio is influenced by the specific characteristics of these markets  including prepayment rates  credit losses  interest rates and the interest rate yield curve 
our results of operations with respect to our mbs portfolio primarily depend on  among other things  the level of our interest income and the amount and cost of borrowings we may obtain by pledging our investment portfolio as collateral for the borrowings 
our interest income  which includes the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of discounts  varies primarily as a result of changes in prepayment speeds of the securities in our mbs portfolio 
our borrowing cost varies based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount we can borrow which is generally based on the fair value of the mbs portfolio and the advance rate the lenders are willing to lend against the collateral provided 
the payment of principal and interest on the agency backed mbs that we acquire and hold is guaranteed by freddie mac or fannie mae 
the payment of principal and interest on agency backed mbs issued by the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or the federal national mortgage association fannie mae is not guaranteed by the us government 
any failure to honor its guarantee of agency backed mbs by freddie mac or fannie mae or any downgrade of securities issued by freddie mac or fannie mae by the rating agencies could cause a significant decline in the value of and cash flow from  any agency backed mbs we own that are guaranteed by such entity 
due to increased market concerns about fannie mae and freddie mac s ability to withstand future credit losses associated with securities held in their investment portfolios  and on which they provide guarantees  without the direct support of the federal government  the government passed the housing and economic recovery act of hera on july  as a result of this legislation  fannie mae and freddie mac have been placed into the conservatorship of the federal housing finance agency fhfa  their federal regulator  pursuant to its powers under the hera 
as the conservator of fannie mae and freddie mac  the fhfa now controls and directs the operations of fannie mae and freddie mac and may i take over the assets of and operate fannie mae and freddie mac with all the powers of the shareholders  the directors  and the officers of fannie mae and freddie mac and conduct all business of fannie mae and freddie mac  ii collect all obligations and money due to fannie mae and freddie mac  iii perform all functions of fannie mae and freddie mac which are consistent with the conservator s appointment  iv preserve and conserve the assets and property of fannie mae and freddie mac  and v contract for assistance in fulfilling any function  activity  action or duty of the conservator 
a primary focus of this new legislation is to increase the availability of mortgage financing by allowing fannie mae and freddie mac to continue to grow their guarantee business without limit  while requiring fannie mae and freddie mac to gradually reduce their agency security portfolios 
conditions in the markets improved during despite a slow recovery for the us economy 
the recovery in the markets  however  remains uneven and vulnerable to changes in investor sentiment 
while us 
table of contents corporate bond markets increased new issue volumes during  securitization markets have been slower to recover and conditions in certain segments remain uncertain 
while the trading activity has increased in the private label mbs market  the supply of newly issued securities is still limited 
as a result  the overall value of these private label mbs has increased 
the increase in competition for the available supply of the private label mbs may prohibit us from acquiring the private label mbs at a favorable price 
the us treasury has signaled that it will announce plans for the future of fannie mae and freddie mac in late february the future roles of fannie mae and freddie mac could be significantly reduced and the nature of their guarantees could be considerably limited relative to historical measurements 
in addition  the us treasury  the federal reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions to address the financial crisis 
we cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur or what impact  if any  such actions could have on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we believe the general business environment will continue to be challenging 
our growth outlook is dependent in part on the extent and severity of the financial market dislocation  results from fiscal and monetary policy actions  and the overall market value of us equities and liquidity 
for further discussions on how markets conditions may affect our business see risk factors 
executive summary during the year ended december   we continued our strategic initiatives designed to strengthen and stabilize our financial and operational positions to maximize the returns to our shareholders and increase our shareholder value 
we evaluate the rates of return that can be achieved in each asset class and for each individual security within an asset class in which we participate 
historically  based on market conditions  we believe our mbs investments have provided us with higher relative risk adjusted rates of return than most other investment opportunities we have evaluated 
consequently  we have maintained a high allocation of our assets and capital in this sector 
we intend to continue to evaluate investment opportunities against the returns available in each of our investment alternatives and endeavor to allocate our assets and capital with an emphasis toward what we believe will generate the highest risk adjusted return available 
this strategy may cause us to have different allocations of capital in different environments 

table of contents for the year ended december   we had net income of million  or per share diluted 
as of december   the company s book value per share was

shareholders as of december   our private label mbs portfolio consisted of million in face value with an amortized cost basis of million  was fair valued at million and had million in unaccreted purchase discount 
during the year ended december   we recognized net interest income of million  representing an annualized yield  including coupon and accretion of purchase discount  from our private label mbs portfolio 
previously  our agency backed mbs portfolio was structured to substantially eliminate market price risk and had a nominal impact on income 
however  as of december   we completed the migration of our agency backed mbs portfolio to a position in which our funding is hedged with eurodollar futures to mitigate interest rate risk 
these eurodollar futures mature through september  and have a lifetime weighted average rate of as of december  as of december   we owned million in fair value  with million in face value  of securities in our leveraged agency backed mbs portfolio 
our private label mbs are primarily senior and re remic tranches in securitization trusts issued between and the senior securities represent interests in securitizations that have the first right to cash flows and absorb losses last 
the re remic securities category represents interests in re securitizations of senior residential mortgage backed securities rmbs and pro rata mezzanine securities 
for re remic securities  the cash flows from  and any credit losses absorbed by  the underlying rmbs are allocated among the re remic securities issued in the re securitization transactions based on the re remic structure 
for example  prime and non prime residential senior securities have been resecuritized to create a two tranche structure with a re remic senior security and a re remic subordinated security 
in these re remic securities  all principal payments from the underlying securities are directed to the re remic senior security until the face value is fully paid off 
thereafter  all principal payments are directed to the re remic subordinated security 
for pro rata mezzanine securities  principal payments from the underlying rmbs are typically allocated concurrently and proportionally to the mezzanine securities along with senior securities 
the re remic subordinated and mezzanine securities 
table of contents absorb credit losses first  if any  however  these credit losses occur only when credit losses exceed the credit protection provided to the underlying securities 
senior  re remic  and mezzanine securities receive interest while any face value is outstanding 
our private label mbs have approximately credit enhancement  which provides protection to our invested capital in addition to our purchase discount 
we generally purchase these private label mbs at a discount to face value 
we estimate  at minimum on a quarterly basis  the future expected cash flows based on our observation of current information and events and applying a number of assumptions related to prepayment rates  interest rates  default rates  and the timing and amount of credit losses 
these assumptions are difficult to predict as they are subject to uncertainties and contingencies related to future events that may impact our estimates and interest income 
based on our estimates of the expected cash flows associated with our discounted private label mbs  a portion of the purchase discount that we are entitled to earn which we consider to be a credit reserve against future potential credit losses  may not be accreted into interest income 
the amount designated as credit reserve may be adjusted over time  based on the actual performance of the security  its underlying collateral  actual and projected cash flow from such collateral  economic conditions and other factors 
if the performance of a security with a credit reserve is more favorable than forecasted  a portion of the amount designated as credit reserve may be accreted into interest income over time 
conversely  if the performance of a security with a credit reserve is less favorable than forecasted  additional amounts of the purchase discount may be designated as a credit reserve  or impairment charges and write downs of such securities to a new cost basis could result 
as of december   we designated million as a credit reserve of the million purchase discount on such securities 
we have been and will continue to evaluate the potential impact of recent developments related to foreclosure suspensions  affidavit errors  and various state and federal government actions on the market price of mbs and related derivative securities 
while it is predictably difficult to foresee the short term and long term impact from the foreclosure issues given all the uncertainties  we anticipate the current foreclosure issues to not have a material negative effect on our overall position and results of operations at this time 
in our private label mbs  we have continued to benefit from the increased allocation of capital to re remic mezzanine securities as well as an average purchase price basis of of face value 
continued expectations of stabilization and improvement in housing  increased liquidity and available leverage have raised prices for private label mbs  particularly among re remic mezzanine securities 
our re remic securities are predominantly held in the subordinate tranches and we will continue to closely monitor the performance of these securities 
we believe we have constructed a private label mbs portfolio with attractive characteristics and will continue to monitor relative value between the various classes of mbs including agency backed mbs and may re allocate our portfolio at any time based on management s view of the market 
we will continue to seek to identify potential opportunities to strengthen our position and to maximize return to our shareholders 
in addition to the financial results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as consistently applied in the united states gaap  we calculate non gaap core operating income for the year ended december  our core operating income for the year ended december  was million 
in determining core operating income  we excluded certain costs and the following non cash expenses compensation costs associated with stock based awards  accretion of mbs purchase discounts adjusted for principal repayments in excess of proportionate invested capital  and unrealized mark to market adjustments on the trading mbs and interest rate hedge instruments 
this non gaap measurement is used by management to analyze and assess the operating results and dividends 
we believe that this non gaap measurement assists investors in understanding the impact of these non core items and non cash expenses on our performance and provides additional clarity around our forward earnings capacity and trend 
a limitation of utilizing this non gaap measure is that the gaap accounting effects of these events do in fact reflect the underlying financial results of our business and these effects should not be ignored in evaluating and analyzing our financial results 
therefore  we believe net income on a gaap basis and core operating income on a non gaap basis should be considered together 

table of contents the following is a reconciliation of gaap net income to non gaap core operating income for the year ended december  dollars in thousands gaap net income adjustments adjusted expenses stock compensation net unrealized mark to market loss on trading mbs and interest rate hedge instruments adjusted interest related to purchase discount accretion non gaap core operating income adjusted expenses represents certain professional fees and income taxes that are not considered representative of routine or core operating related activities of the company 
adjusted interest related to purchase discount accretion represents purchase discount accretion in excess of principal repayment in excess of proportional share of invested capital

table of contents december  and in previous years  in determining the lower of cost or market value of the securitized mortgage loans  we considered various factors affecting the overall value of the portfolio  including but not limited to factors such as prepayment speeds  default rates  loss assumption  geographic locations  collateral values and mortgage insurance coverage 
based on such factors  we assessed the present value of expected loan cash flows considering the specific characteristics of each individual loan 
significant assumptions used by us in determining this value were supported by comparisons to market data for similar portfolios and transactions  when available

shareholders 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund investments  and for other general business purposes 
our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of short term borrowings eg  repurchase agreements  principal and interest payments on mbs  dividends on equity securities and proceeds from sales of mbs 
liquidity  or ready access to funds  is essential to our business 
failures of similar businesses have often been attributable in large part to insufficient liquidity 
liquidity is of particular importance to our business and perceived liquidity issues may affect our clients and counterparties willingness to engage in transactions with us 
our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control  such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects us or third parties 
further  our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time 
if we cannot obtain funding from third parties or from our subsidiaries  our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
potential future sources of liquidity for us include existing cash balances  borrowing capacity through margin accounts and repurchase agreements and cash flows from operations  future issuances of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities or derivatives of those securities 
funding for agency mbs through repurchase agreements continues to be available to us at rates we consider to be attractive from multiple counterparties and 
table of contents we have observed increased availability for funding for private label mbs through repurchase agreements 
although the availability of the third party sources of liquidity has improved  we have observed that market conditions are still constraining access to debt capital relative to pre crisis levels of as a result  the availability of certain short term liquidity such as commercial paper borrowings was still limited as of december  on january   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s file no 
with the sec 
the shelf registration statement was declared effective on january  pursuant to the shelf registration statement  we may issue and publicly distribute various types of securities  including class a common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants and units  or any combination of such securities  from time to time  in one or more offerings  up to an aggregate amount of million 
we filed the shelf registration statement to gain additional flexibility in accessing capital markets for  among other things  the acquisition of mbs and other assets  the repayment of outstanding indebtedness  the pursuit of growth initiatives that may include acquisitions  working capital  and for liquidity needs 
there is no assurance  however  that we will be able to access the capital markets on favorable terms or at all 
cash flows as of december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million representing a net increase in the balance of million from million as of december  from continuing operations 
cash provided by operating activities of million during was offset by net cash outflows of million from investing activities and net cash inflows of million from financing activities 
cash provided by operating activity was attributable primarily to cash operating income and net changes in operating assets and liabilities from continuing operations 
our investing activities during included proceeds from sales of  and receipt of principal payments from mbs totaling million 
these cash inflows were offset by million used to purchase mbs 
our financing activities reflected net proceeds from repurchase agreement borrowings of million and million in dividends paid 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million representing a net decrease in the balance of million from million as of december  from continuing operations 
our cash and cash equivalents held by discontinued operations were and million as of december  and  respectively 
cash used in operating activities of million during was offset by net cash inflows of million from investing activities and net cash outflows of million from financing activities 
cash used in operating activity was attributable primarily to cash operating losses and net changes in operating assets and liabilities for both continuing and discontinued operations 
our investing activities during included proceeds from sales of  and receipt of principal payments from mbs totaling billion and proceeds of million from us treasury bond maturity 
these cash inflows were offset by million used to purchase mbs 
our financing activities reflected net repayments of repurchase agreement borrowings of million  million related to the extinguishment of long term debt  and million proceeds from the sale of fbr capital markets common stock during sources of funding we believe that our existing cash balances  investment in private label mbs  net investments in agency backed mbs  cash flows from operations  borrowing capacity and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
we have obtained  and believe we will be able to continue to obtain  short term financing in amounts and at interest rates consistent with our financing objectives 
we may  however  seek debt or equity financings  in public or private transactions  to provide capital for 
table of contents corporate purposes and or strategic business opportunities  including possible acquisitions  joint ventures  alliances or other business arrangements which could require substantial capital outlays 
our policy is to evaluate strategic business opportunities  including acquisitions and divestitures  as they arise 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient funds from future operations  or raise sufficient debt or equity on acceptable terms  to take advantage of investment opportunities that become available 
should our needs ever exceed these sources of liquidity  we believe that most of our investments could be sold  in most circumstances  to provide cash 
however  we may be required to sell our assets at depressed prices 
as of december   our liabilities totaled million 
in addition to other payables and accrued expenses  our indebtedness consisted of repurchase agreements and long term debentures 
these long term debt securities accrue and require payments of interest quarterly at annual rates of three month libor plus to  mature between and  and are currently redeemable by us  in whole or in part  without penalty 
as of december   we had million of total long term debt 
we also have short term financing facilities that are structured as repurchase agreements with various financial institutions to primarily fund our portfolio of agency backed mbs 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate under these agreements was 
our repurchase agreements include provisions contained in the standard master repurchase agreement as published by the securities industry and financial markets association sifma and may be amended and supplemented in accordance with industry standards for repurchase facilities 
our repurchase agreements include financial covenants  with which the failure to comply would constitute an event of default under the applicable repurchase agreement 
similarly  each repurchase agreement includes events of insolvency and events of default on other indebtedness 
as provided in the standard master repurchase agreement as typically amended  upon the occurrence of an event of default or termination event the applicable counterparty has the option to terminate all repurchase transactions under such counterparty s repurchase agreement and to demand immediate payment of any amount due from us to the counterparty 
under our repurchase agreements  we may be required to pledge additional assets to our repurchase agreement counterparties in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral ie  a margin call  which may take the form of additional securities or cash 
margin calls on repurchase agreements collateralized by our mbs investments primarily result from events such as declines in the value of the underlying mortgage collateral caused by factors such as rising interest rates or prepayments 
to date  we have not had any margin calls on our repurchase agreements that we were not able to satisfy with either cash or additional pledged collateral 
however  should we encounter increases in interest rates or prepayments  margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result in a manner that could cause a material adverse change in our liquidity position 
in the event that market conditions are such that we are unable to obtain financing for our investments in mbs in amounts and at interest rates consistent with our financing objectives  to the extent deemed appropriate  we may use cash to finance our investments or we may liquidate such investments 
accordingly  depending on market conditions  we may incur significant losses on any such sales of mbs 
the following table provides information regarding our outstanding repurchase agreement borrowings as of the dates and periods indicated dollars in thousands december  outstanding balance weighted average rate weighted average term to maturity days days maximum amount outstanding at any month end during the year 
table of contents assets our principal assets consist of mbs  cash and cash equivalents  receivables  deposits and long term investments 
as of december   liquid assets consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents of million and net investments in mbs of million 
cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in debt obligations of the us government 
our total assets increased from million at december  to million as of december  the increase in total assets reflects the results of implementing our strategic plan as previously discussed 
as of december   the total par and fair value of the mbs portfolio was million and million  respectively 
as of december   the weighted average coupon of the portfolio was dividends pursuant to our variable dividend policy  our board of directors evaluates dividends on a quarterly basis and  in its sole discretion  approves the payment of dividends 
our dividend payments  if any  may vary significantly quarter to quarter 
the board of directors approved and we declared and paid the following dividends for quarter ended dividend amount declaration date record date pay date december december december january  september september september october june may june july march february march april the company did not declare or pay out dividends on our class a or class b common stock during and contractual obligations we have contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with borrowings and non cancelable lease agreements and other contractual commitments as well as uncalled capital commitments to various investment partnerships that may be called over the next ten years 
the following table sets forth these contractual obligations by fiscal year in thousands thereafter total borrowings minimum rental and other contractual commitments capital commitments this table excludes interest payments to be made on our long term debt securities 
based on the weighted average interest rate of as of december   approximately thousand in accrued interest on the current outstanding principal will be paid for the quarter ending march  interest on the million of long term debt floats based on the month libor  therefore  actual coupon interest will likely differ from this estimate 
these long term debt securities mature beginning in october through july equipment and office rent expense for  and was thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively 
the table above excludes million of uncalled capital commitments as of december  to various investment partnerships that may be called over the next ten years 
this commitment was million at

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we monitor market and business risk  including credit  interest rate  equity  operations  liquidity  compliance  legal  reputational  and equity ownership risks through a number of control procedures designed to identify and evaluate the various risks to which our business and assets are exposed 
market risk generally represents the risk of loss through a change in realizable value that can result from a change in the prices of securities  a change in the value of financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates  a change in the volatility of interest rates or a change in the credit rating of an issuer 
we are exposed to the following market risks as a result of our investments in mbs and equity investments 
credit risk although we do not expect to encounter credit risk in our agency backed mbs portfolio assuming fannie mae and freddie mac remain solvent  we are exposed to credit risk in our private label mbs portfolio 
with respect to our private label mbs  credit support contained in these mbs deal structures provides a level of protection from losses  as do the discounted purchase prices in the event of the return of less than of par 
we also evaluate the impact of credit risk on our investments through a comprehensive investment review and a selection process  which is predominantly focused on quantifying and pricing credit risk 
we review our private label mbs based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of the risk adjusted returns on such investments 
through modeling and scenario analysis  we seek to evaluate each investment s credit risk 
credit risk is also monitored through our ongoing asset surveillance 
despite these measures to manage credit risk  unanticipated credit losses could nevertheless occur which could adversely impact our operating results 
our private label mbs are generally purchased at a discount 
we estimate the future expected cash flows based on our observation of current information and events and applying a number of assumptions related to prepayment rates  interest rates  default rates  and the timing and amount of credit losses 
these assumptions are difficult to predict as they are subject to uncertainties and contingencies related to future events that may impact our estimates and interest income 
based on the expected cash flows  to the extent that a security has a probability of incurring credit loss  a portion of the purchase discount that we are entitled to earn which we consider to be a credit reserve against future potential credit losses  may not be accreted into interest income 
the amount designated as credit reserve may be adjusted over time  based on the actual performance of the security  its underlying collateral  actual and projected cash flow from such collateral  economic conditions and other factors 
if the performance of a security with a credit reserve is more favorable than forecasted  a portion of the amount designated as credit reserve may be accreted into interest income over time 
conversely  if the performance of a security with a credit reserve is less favorable than forecasted  additional amounts of the purchase discount may be designated as credit reserve  or impairment charges and write downs of such securities to a new cost basis could result 
as of and for the year ended december   we designated million as credit reserve on such securities which is net of a million reclassification from credit reserve to accretable discount as a result of improvements in actual and projected performance of the securities 

table of contents the following table represents certain statistics of our non agency mbs portfolio as of and for the year ended december  senior securities re remic securities total yield of amortized cost average cost of face value weighted average coupon delinquencies greater than plus days credit enhancement severity three months average constant prepayment rate three months average key credit and prepayment measures in our non agency mbs portfolio continued a positive trend during the year ended december  total day plus delinquencies in the company s non agency mbs portfolio declined to at december  from at december  and trailing three month average loss severities on liquidated loans declined to at december  from at december  the table that follows shows the expected change in fair value for our current mbs related to our principal investing activities under several hypothetical credit loss scenarios 
our private label mbs are classified as level assets of the fair value hierarchy as they are valued using present value techniques based on estimated cash flows of the security taking into consideration various assumptions derived by management and used by other market participants 
these assumptions include  among others  interest rates  prepayment rates  discount rates  credit loss rates  and the timing of credit losses 
credit default and loss severity rates can significantly affect the prices of private label mbs 
while it is impossible to project exact amount of changes in value  the table below illustrates the impact a increase and a decrease in the credit default and loss severity rates  from those used as our valuation assumptions  would have on the value of our total assets and our book value as of december  the changes in rates are assumed to occur instantaneously 
actual changes in market conditions are likely to be different from these assumptions dollars in thousands  except per share amounts

through our principal investment activities  we invest in agency backed mbs and finance these investments with repurchase agreements which are interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
we are exposed to interest rate risk that fluctuates based on changes in the level or volatility of interest rates and mortgage prepayments and in the shape 
table of contents and slope of the yield curve 
we attempt to hedge a portion of our exposure to interest rate fluctuations primarily through the use of eurodollar futures 
the counterparties to our derivative agreements at december  are us financial institutions 
we assess and monitor the counterparties non performance risk and credit risk on a regular basis 
our primary risk is related to changes in both short and long term interest rates  which affect us in several ways 
as interest rates increase  the market value of the mbs may be expected to decline  prepayment rates may be expected to go down  and duration may be expected to extend 
an increase in interest rates is beneficial to the market value of our derivative instruments 
for example  for interest rate swap positions  the cash flows from receiving the floating rate portion increase and the fixed rate paid remains the same under this scenario 
if interest rates decline  the reverse is true for mbs  paying fixed and receiving floating interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  and eurodollar futures and put option contracts 
the table that follows shows the expected change in fair value for our current mbs and derivatives related to our principal investing activities under several hypothetical interest rate scenarios 
interest rates are defined by the us treasury yield curve 
the changes in rates are assumed to occur instantaneously 
it is further assumed that the changes in rates occur uniformly across the yield curve and that the level of libor changes by the same amount as the yield curve 
actual changes in market conditions are likely to be different from these assumptions 
changes in value are measured as percentage changes from their respective values presented in the column labeled value at december  management s estimate of change in value for mbs is based on the same assumptions it uses to manage the impact of interest rates on the portfolio 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
for mbs  the estimated change in value of the mbs reflects an effective duration of in a rising interest rate environment and in a declining interest rate environment 
the effective durations are based on observed market value changes  as well as management s own estimate of the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of the investments including assumptions regarding prepayments based  in part  on age of and interest rate on the mortgages underlying the mbs  prior exposure to refinancing opportunities  and an overall analysis of historical prepayment patterns under a variety of past interest rate conditions dollars in thousands  except per share amounts 
value at december  value at december  with basis point increase in interest rates percent change value at december  with basis point decrease in interest rates percent change assets mbs other total assets liabilities repurchase agreements derivative liabilities other total liabilities equity total liabilities and equity book value per share as shown above  our portfolio of mbs generally will be more adversely affected by a increase in interest rates than the same scale decrease in interest rates 

table of contents equity price risk although limited  we are exposed to equity price risk as a result of our investments in marketable equity securities and investment partnerships 
equity price risk changes as the volatility of equity prices changes or the values of corresponding equity indices change 
while it is impossible to exactly project what factors may affect the prices of equity sectors and how much the effect might be  the table below illustrates the impact a increase and a decrease in the price of the equities held by us would have on the value of our total assets and our book value as of december  dollars in thousands  except per share amounts

critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience  when available  and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  management exercises significant judgment in the final determination of our estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our most critical policies that are both very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates are discussed below 
principal investing securities we account for our holdings in mbs and marketable equity securities in accordance with accounting principles related to accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these principles require that investments in debt securities be designated at the time of acquisition as held to maturity  available for sale or trading  and investments in equity securities be designated as either available for sale or trading 
nearly 
table of contents all of our mbs and marketable equity securities are designated as available for sale and are carried at their estimated fair values with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income or loss  a component of equity 
although we generally intend to hold our mbs until maturity  we may  from time to time  sell any of our mbs as part of the overall management of our business 
the available for sale designation provides us with the flexibility to sell our mbs in order to act on potential market opportunities or changes in economic conditions to ensure future liquidity and to meet other general corporate purposes as they arise 
the accounting principles related to fair value measurements define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  not adjusted for transaction costs 
these accounting principles also establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level as described below level inputs unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that is accessible by us  level inputs quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable  either directly or indirectly  and level inputs unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  including our significant assumptions and other market participants 
our agency backed mbs  which are guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac  and other aaa rated private label mbs  if any  are generally classified within level of the fair value hierarchy as they are valued using quoted market prices provided by a broker or dealer  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
the independent brokers and dealers providing market prices are those who make markets in these financial instruments 
we classify certain non agency mbs within level of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and  therefore  have little or no price transparency 
these mbs include private label mbs  residual interests in securitizations of non prime mortgage loans  and collateralized mortgage obligations 
we utilize present value techniques based on estimated cash flows of the instrument taking into consideration various assumptions derived by management and used by other market participants 
these assumptions are corroborated by evidence such as historical data  risk characteristics  transactions in similar instruments  and completed or pending transactions  when available 
establishing market value is inherently subjective given the volatile and sometimes illiquid markets for some of our mbs and requires us to make a number of assumptions  including assumptions about the future of interest rates  prepayment rates  discount rates  credit loss rates  and the timing of credit losses 
the assumptions we apply are specific to each mbs 
although we rely on our internal calculations to compute the fair value of these mbs  we request and consider indications of value mark from third party dealers to assist us in our valuation process 
we evaluate available for sale securities and equity securities of non public companies carried at cost for other than temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
the value of our mbs and our investments in marketable equity securities can fluctuate significantly 
in evaluating these investments for other than temporary impairment  consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been lower than carrying value  the severity of the decline in fair value  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  our intent to sell  and whether it is more likely than not we would be required to sell the security before 
table of contents anticipated recovery 
if it is determined that an investment impairment is other than temporary then the amount that the fair value is below its current basis is recorded as an impairment charge and recorded through earnings 
for unrealized losses that are determined to be temporary  a further evaluation is performed to determine the credit portion of the other than temporary impairment and the credit portion is recorded through our income statement 
we continue to evaluate unrealized losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss at each reporting date and if we determine at a future date that impairment is other than temporary  the applicable unrealized loss will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss and recorded as a realized loss at the time the determination is made 
for the year ended december   we recorded no other than temporary impairment write downs on the mbs portfolio 
accounting for taxes we provided for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
the measurement of net deferred tax assets is adjusted by a valuation allowance if  based on our evaluation  it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
we recognize tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position 
a position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized upon settlement 
a liability is established for differences between positions taken in a tax return and the financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amended accounting principles related to accounting for fair value measurements and disclosures 
this amendment improved the disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements and disclosures 
we adopted this guidance effective june  the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued amended accounting principles related to accounting for transfers of financial assets 
this amendment improved financial reporting by eliminating the exceptions for qualified special purpose entities from the consolidation guidance and the exception that permitted sale accounting for certain mortgage securitizations when a transferor has not surrendered control over the transferred financial assets 
in addition  comparability and consistency in accounting for transferred financial assets was improved through clarifications of the requirements for isolation and limitations on portions of financial assets that are eligible for sale accounting 
we adopted this guidance effective january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued amended accounting principles related to the consolidation of variable interest entities 
this amendment replaced the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity 
an approach that is expected to be primarily qualitative is considered more effective for identifying which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
we adopted this guidance effective january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements
