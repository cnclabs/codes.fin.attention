table of contents critical business metrics of the reis services business management considers certain metrics in evaluating the performance of the reis services business 
these metrics are revenue  ebitda which is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and ebitda margin 
following is a presentation of these historical metrics for the reis services business for a reconciliation of gaap net income loss to ebitda and adjusted ebitda for both the reis services segment and on a consolidated basis for each of the periods presented here  see below 
amounts in thousands  excluding percentages for the three months ended december  percentage increase increase revenue ebitda ebitda margin for the three months ended percentage december  september  increase decrease increase decrease revenue ebitda ebitda margin for the years ended percentage december  increase increase decrease decrease revenue ebitda ebitda margin reis services s revenue increased by approximately  from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of this revenue increase over the corresponding prior quarterly period is the third consecutive quarterly increase in revenue over the prior year s quarter 
in addition  revenue increased by approximately  from the year ended december  to in general  the improving revenue results in the period reflect positive improvements in overall renewal rates as the trailing twelve month renewal rate improved to at december  as compared to for the year ended december   reduced budgeting constraints by current and prospective subscribers  which during and negatively impacted renewal rates and pricing on subscription contracts entered into at that time  as well as the cumulative impact of the strength of contract signings beginning in the fourth quarter of and continued throughout our overall trailing twelve month renewal rates improved from to and  for institutional subscribers  the renewal rates improved from to from december  to december   respectively 
the fourth quarter and full year of were record periods for the company for total contracts signed based upon the value of annual contracts executed in those periods for both new and renewal business 
the fourth quarter of also represented the best quarter for new business  based upon the value of annual contracts executed in that period  and the annual period was the second best annual period for new business trailing only the annual period 
the renewal rate improvements  coupled with new business from both existing and new subscribers  allowed revenue to stabilize in the first nine months of as older prior year contracts rolled out of the revenue base and a higher percentage of expiring contracts were renewed 
the level of contract signings in  and specifically in the fourth quarter of  resulted in revenue growth in the fourth quarter of and is expected to translate into revenue growth in over amounts 
reis s revenue model is based primarily on annual subscriptions that are paid in accordance with contractual billing terms 
reis recognizes revenue from its contracts on a ratable basis  for example  one twelfth of the value of a one year contract is recognized monthly 
therefore  increases in the dollar value of new contracts are spread evenly over the life of a contract  thereby moderating an immediate impact on revenue 
it took over four quarters to realize the full impact of contract declines on revenue in late and into these older  lower value contracts will roll and be replaced by renewals with more favorable pricing over a similar time period 
this trend is evidenced by our quarterly revenue  as each of the first three quarters reported stable revenue at slightly over 
table of contents  followed by growth in the fourth quarter of to  or an increase of  or  over the third quarter our contract pricing model is based on actual and projected report consumption  we believe it is generally not as susceptible to economic downturns and personnel reductions at our subscribers as a model based upon individual user licenses 
we generally impose contractual restrictions limiting our immediate exposure during existing contract terms to revenue reductions due to mergers and consolidations 
however  we have been  and we may in the future be  impacted by consolidation among our subscribers and potential subscribers  or in the event that subscribers enter bankruptcy or otherwise go out of business 
as budget constraints and economic pressures moderate  there has been an overall positive impact on revenue stabilization and growth 
these impacts can be seen in the reported results for in excess of revenue and the growth on a consecutive quarter basis from the third quarter to fourth quarter two additional metrics management believes are critical in understanding the business and future performance are deferred revenue and aggregate revenue under contract 
analyzing these amounts can provide additional insight into reis services s financial performance 
deferred revenue  which is a gaap basis accounting concept and is reported by the company on the consolidated balance sheet  represents revenue from annual or longer term contracts for which we have billed and or received payments from our subscribers related to services we will be providing over the period and for which we have charged the subscribers 
it does not include future revenue under non cancellable contracts for which we do not yet have the contractual right to bill  this aggregate number we refer to as aggregate revenue under contract 
deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of a contract 
the following table reconciles deferred revenue to aggregate revenue under contract at december  and december  percentage increase increase deferred revenue gaap basis amounts under non cancellable contracts for which the company does not yet have the contractual right to bill at december  a aggregate revenue under contract b a amounts are billable subsequent to december  and represents i non cancellable contracts for subscribers with multi year subscriptions where the future years are not yet billable  or ii subscribers with non cancellable annual subscriptions with interim billing terms 
b included in aggregate revenue under contract at december  was approximately  related to amounts under contract for the remainder reflects amounts under contract for and included in aggregate revenue under contract at december  was approximately  related to amounts under contract for at that date  representing an increase of 
the increases in both the deferred revenue and aggregate revenue under contract are the result of an improved sale environment for renewals  increased new business and the signing of more multi year contracts in over as described above in the revenue discussion 
ebitda decreased  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this is primarily a result of cost increases  primarily in sales and marketing expenses for increases in commissions in over  salary and benefit increases in from hiring for product development and enhancement initiatives  wage increases for existing employees  increased marketing expenses related to our reisreports offering and the continuing increase in the cost of employee benefits  primarily for medical insurance 
ebitda for the fourth quarter of modestly improved  over the fourth quarter of  primarily from a revenue increase  in excess of cost increases 
however  on a sequential quarter basis  ebitda declined slightly  by  primarily from increased commissions on fourth quarter sales 
management expects that ebitda and ebitda margins in will be negatively impacted in the short term by our continuing product development and enhancement initiatives  as well as marketing expenses for reisreports 
although this spending is likely to reduce margins for the reis services segment into the mid range  at least in the first half of  the expectation is that this spending and investment will support additional revenue growth in the future 
reconciliations of net income loss to ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation 
although ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  senior management uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda to measure operational and management performance 
management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda are appropriate metrics that may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to be considered in addition to the reported gaap basis financial information to assist investors in evaluating and understanding the performance of the reis services segment  the primary business 
table of contents of the company and the company s consolidated results  from year to year or period to period  as applicable 
further  these measures provide the reader with the ability to understand our operational performance while isolating non cash charges  such as depreciation and amortization expenses  as well as other non operating items  such as interest income  interest expense and income taxes and  in the case of adjusted ebitda  isolates non cash charges for stock based compensation 
management also believes that disclosing ebitda and adjusted ebitda will provide better comparability to other companies in the information services sector 
however  investors should not consider these measures in isolation or as substitutes for net income loss  operating income loss  or any other measure for determining operating performance that is calculated in accordance with gaap 
in addition  because ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not calculated in accordance with gaap  they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies

the company has aggregate nol carryfowards aggregating approximately  at december  these nols include nols generated subsequent to the merger  losses from private reis prior to the merger  losses obtained from the company s merger with value property trust vlp and the company s operating losses prior to the merger 
approximately  of these nols are subject to an annual limitation  whereas  are not subject to such a limitation 
all of these nols can potentially be used against consolidated taxable income as further described below 
private reis had nol carryforwards aggregating approximately  at december   which expire in the years to during the seven month period subsequent to the merger  the company generated nols of approximately  and during the year ended december   generated additional nols of approximately  which expire in the years and  respectively 
these losses  which aggregate  at december   may be utilized against consolidated taxable income  all of which amounts are available for use for financial statement reporting purposes at december  the taxable loss of  for primarily reflects the realization of a  loss for tax purposes from the sale of the claverack project in february if the company were able to sell its east lyme project  an additional loss of approximately  would be realized which could also be utilized against consolidated taxable income without limitation

although the company believes there is a basis for concluding that the cobe requirements were met throughout the required two year period subsequent to the ownership change  management concluded that the company could not meet the more likely than not criteria for recognizing a deferred tax asset relating to such losses for gaap accounting purposes 
the company has utilized an aggregate of approximately  of these nols in its federal tax return filings for and  with appropriate disclosure 
such amounts have also been deducted to arrive at the  of nols described above  for financial reporting purposes 
a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  management has determined that a valuation allowance of approximately  and  at december  and  respectively  was necessary 
the allowances at december  and relate primarily to amt credits  nols in and to the excess of a portion of the tax basis of certain real estate development assets over their respective financial statement basis 
the decrease in the allowance in is attributable to the change in the estimate of the realization of the real estate asset basis differences 
the company s reserve for unrecognized tax benefits  including estimated interest and penalties  was approximately  and  at december  and  respectively

the liability for option cancellations could materially change from period to period based upon an option holder either a exercising the options in a traditional manner or b electing the net cash settlement alternative and the changes in the market price of the company s common stock 
at each period end  an increase in the company s common stock price would result in an 
table of contents increase in compensation expense  whereas a decline in the stock price would reduce compensation expense

the effects of inflation declining prices and trends reis services the company monitors commercial real estate industry and market trends to determine their potential impact on its products and product development initiatives 
the volatility and uncertainty in the us and global economy in and  including the credit markets and real estate markets  negatively affected renewal rates  with the greatest impact on the company being felt between the beginning of the fourth quarter of and continuing through june  because of budget constraints at certain subscribers and potential subscribers  the effective shutdown of the cmbs markets and the flurry of mergers and bankruptcies of financial institutions in the fall of some of which were subscribers of the company  the company was negatively impacted as exhibited by our revenue reductions throughout however  in  we experienced a positive trend of revenue growth as the second  third  and fourth quarters of had revenue growth as compared to the corresponding quarters of and revenue exceeded revenue on an annual basis 
our overall annual renewal rate is for the trailing twelve months ended december   an improvement from for the trailing twelve months ended december  this positive trend in renewal rates will continue to be reflected in future quarterly revenues 
the fourth quarter and full year of were record periods for the company for total contracts signed based upon the value of annual subscriptions executed in those periods for both new and renewal business 
the fourth quarter of also represented the best quarter for new business  based upon the value of annual subscriptions executed in that period and the annual period was the second best annual period for total contracts signed trailing only the annual period 
the level of contract signings in  and specifically in the fourth quarter of  resulted in revenue growth in the fourth quarter of and should translate into revenue growth in over amounts 
these trends and results are evidenced by the significant increase in both our reported amounts of deferred revenue and aggregate revenue under contract at december  there can be no assurance that the increase in the trailing twelve month renewal rates experienced from the middle of through december  will further improve or continue and that new or renewal business will continue to grow in the future 
the company has historically mitigated market pressures by continuing to add new subscribers  selling new products and identifying additional and or alternative users within the organizations and institutions that are current subscribers 
historically  during periods of economic and commercial real estate market volatility  as was the case during and  we generally experienced stable or only moderately lower demand for our market information and an increase in demand for our portfolio products  despite or in many cases  because of decreased transaction volumes  as investors placed greater emphasis on assessing portfolio risk 
even though we continue to broaden the appeal and utility of our database  tools and functionality  we cannot assure you that the level of demand for reis services s products will be sustained or increase during or in the future 
lot and land sales in the residential development activities segment although the company sold its claverack project in bulk in february  the company s operations relating to the sale of individual and bulk lots have been negatively impacted by poor national  regional and local market conditions where the company owns property 
illiquidity in the residential mortgage and construction development loan markets has negatively impacted our marketing efforts and the ability of buyers developers  local builders or land investors to afford and or finance the purchase of lots  either individually or in bulk  as well as their inability to finance required infrastructure work  causing us to reduce our asking price 
the number and timing of future sales by the company could be adversely impacted by the lack of availability of credit to potential buyers and  in the case of developers and local builders  the inability to sell inventory they build to individual buyers who may be unable to obtain financing 
at december   lots remain in inventory at the east lyme project 
we intend to sell the remaining east lyme lots in one or more bulk transactions 

table of contents changes in cash flows comparison of cash flows for the years ended december  and cash flows for the years ended december  and are summarized as follows for the years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows provided by operating activities decreased  from  provided in the period to  provided in the period 
the decrease in cash flows from operating activities is a function of increased uses of cash in the period related to accrued expenses due to the timing of payments and settlement of employment and other contractual obligations previously accrued for and a decrease in real estate sales between the two periods 
these decreases were offset by an increase in the cash flows from operating activities of the reis services segment of  from  provided in the period to  provided in the period primarily due to increased collections in the period 
cash flows used in investing activities increased  from  used in the period to  used in the period 
this change primarily resulted from an increase in cash used in the period as compared to the period for web site and database development costs of  and furniture  fixtures and equipment additions of  coupled with the proceeds from the sale of an investment in a variable interest entity of  offset by  of furniture  fixtures and equipment dispositions in cash flows used in financing activities decreased  from  used in the period to  used in the period

selected significant accounting policies management has identified the following accounting policies which it believes are significant in understanding the company s activities  financial position and operating results 
basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its majority owned and controlled subsidiaries 
investments in entities where the company does not have a controlling interest are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
these investments were initially recorded at cost and were subsequently adjusted for the company s proportionate share of the investment s income loss and additional contributions or distributions 
all significant inter company accounts and transactions among the company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation 
intangible assets  amortization and impairment web site development costs the company expenses all internet web site costs incurred during the preliminary project stage 
thereafter  all direct external and internal development and implementation costs are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over their remaining estimated useful lives  not exceeding three years 
the value ascribed to the web site intangible asset acquired at the time of the 
table of contents merger was amortized on a straight line basis over three years  and during  this ascribed value was fully amortized 
amortization of all capitalized web site development costs is charged to product development expense 
database costs the company capitalizes costs for the development of its database in connection with the identification and addition of new real estate properties and sale transactions which provide a future economic benefit 
amortization is calculated on a straight line basis over a three or five year period 
costs of updating and maintaining information on existing properties in the database are expensed as incurred 
the value ascribed to the database intangible asset acquired at the time of the merger is amortized on a straight line basis over three or five years  and during  the ascribed value which had a three year amortizable life was fully amortized 
amortization of all capitalized database costs is charged to cost of sales 
customer relationships the value ascribed to customer relationships acquired at the time of the merger is amortized over years on an accelerated basis and is charged to sales and marketing expense 
lease value the value ascribed to the below market terms of the office lease existing at the time of the merger is amortized over the remaining term of the acquired office lease which was approximately nine years 
amortization is charged to general and administrative expenses 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment goodwill and a major portion of the other intangible assets were recorded at the time of the merger 
as a result of the tax treatment of the merger  goodwill and the acquired intangible assets are not deductible for income tax purposes 
goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually  or after a triggering event has occurred  requiring such a calculation 
the evaluation is based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned with the reporting unit s carrying value 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based upon market projections for the reporting unit 
these market projections utilize a number of estimates and assumptions  such as ebitda multiples  market comparisons  and quoted market prices 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not deemed to be impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  a second step is required to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit 
there was no goodwill impairment identified in or intangible assets  with determinable useful lives  are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up 
in addition  the carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment 
if estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset would be considered impaired 
an impairment charge would be determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value  with any shortfall from fair value recognized as an expense in the current period 
there was no intangible asset impairment identified in or real estate and impairment costs directly related to the acquisition  development and improvement of real estate were capitalized  including interest and other costs incurred during the construction period 
ordinary repairs  maintenance and project operating costs are expensed as incurred 
the company has historically reviewed its real estate assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable for assets held for use and when a determination is made to sell an asset or investment 
if estimated cash flows on an undiscounted basis are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of an asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over estimated fair value is recognized 
no impairment charges were recorded during or related to the company s real estate assets 
revenue recognition and related items the company s subscription revenue is derived principally from subscriptions to its web based services for its reis se product and is recognized as revenue ratably over the related contractual period  which is typically one year but can be as long as months 

table of contents revenues from ad hoc and custom reports or projects are recognized as completed and delivered to the customers  provided that no significant company obligations remain 
revenues from the reisreports product are recognized monthly as billed 
deferred revenue represents the portion of a subscription billed or collected in advance under the terms of the respective contract  which will be recognized in future periods 
if a customer does not meet the payment obligations of a contract  any related accounts receivable and deferred revenue are written off at that time and the net amount  after considering any recovery of accounts receivable  is charged to cost of sales 
cost of sales of subscription revenue principally consists of salaries and related expenses for the company s researchers who collect and analyze the commercial real estate data that is the basis for the company s information services 
additionally  cost of sales includes the amortization of database technology 
revenue from sales of real estate  including condominium units  single family homes and sales of lots individually or in bulk are recognized at closing subject to receipt of down payments and other requirements in accordance with applicable accounting guidelines 
the percentage of completion method was not used for recording sales on condominium units as downpayments were nominal and collectability of the sales price from such a deposit was not reasonably assured until closing 
interest revenue is recorded on an accrual basis 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are estimated to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances with respect to deferred income tax assets are recorded when deemed appropriate and adjusted based upon periodic evaluations 
the company evaluates its tax positions in accordance with applicable current accounting literature 
recognition of uncertain tax positions step one occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step two determines the amount of benefit that more likely than not will be realized upon settlement 
derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained or there is a satisfactory resolution of the tax position 
share based compensation the fair market value as of the grant date of awards of stock  restricted stock units or certain stock options is recognized as compensation expense by the company over the respective vesting periods 
the company estimated the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the following table includes the assumptions that were made and the estimated fair value for option grants in no option awards were granted during grant stock price on grant date exercise price dividend yield risk free interest rate expected life years estimated volatility fair value of options granted per option although the initial fair value of stock options is not adjusted after the grant date  changes in the company s assumptions may change the value of  and therefore the expense related to  future stock option grants 
the assumptions that cause the greatest variation in fair value are the expected volatility and expected life of the option 
increases or decreases in either the expected volatility or expected life of the option will cause the fair value to increase or decrease  respectively 
the volatility assumption of approximately considers both historical and implied volatility and may be impacted by the company s performance as well as changes in economic and market conditions 
the expected life of years for the options was determined based upon historical exercise patterns and a probability weighted exercise analysis 
if the estimated volatility used by the company during was increased to and the expected life used by the company during was increased to years  the fair value of the options would have increased to per option  
table of contents or 
if the estimated volatility used by the company during was decreased to and the expected life used by the company during was decreased to years  the fair value of the options would have decreased to per option  or

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure has been to changes in interest rates 
this risk is generally managed by limiting the company s financing exposures  to the extent possible  by purchasing interest rate caps when deemed appropriate 
at december   the company s only exposure to interest rates was variable rate based debt 
this exposure has historically been minimized through the use of interest rate caps 
the interest rate cap on the bank loan expired at june  the following tables present the effect of a increase in the applicable base rates of variable rate debt at december  and  respectively amounts in thousands balance at december  libor at december  additional interest incurred variable rate debt bank loan  a balance at december  notional amount at december  libor cap libor at december  additional interest incurred variable rate debt with interest rate caps bank loan   a a reflects additional interest which could be incurred annually on the loan balance amount as a result of a increase in libor 
it does not take into consideration future periodic repayments 
although the interest rate cap expired at june   our interest rate exposure on the bank loan will continue to diminish significantly as a result of increased scheduled principal repayments during of approximately  reis holds cash and cash equivalents at various regional and national banking institutions 
management monitors the institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents 
management s emphasis is primarily on safety of principal 
management  in its discretion  has diversified reis s cash and cash equivalents among banking institutions to potentially minimize exposure to any one of these entities 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents  however  we can provide no assurances that access to invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
cash balances held at banking institutions with which we do business may exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits 
while management monitors the cash balances in these bank accounts  such cash balances could be impacted if the underlying banks fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets
