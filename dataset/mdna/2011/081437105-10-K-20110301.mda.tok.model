item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis three years ended december  management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this annual report on form k 
three year review of results dollars in millions net sales cost of products sold gross margin selling  general  and administrative expenses all other expenses income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax net income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to bemis company  inc effective income tax rate overview bemis company  inc is a leading global manufacturer of flexible packaging and pressure sensitive materials supplying a variety of markets 
generally about percent of our total company net sales are to customers in the food industry 
sales of our flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store 
our emphasis on supplying packaging to the food industry has historically provided a more stable market environment for our flexible packaging business segment  which accounts for about percent of our net sales 
our remaining net sales is from the pressure sensitive materials business segment which  while diversified in end use products  is less focused on food industry applications and more exposed to economically sensitive end markets 
market conditions the markets into which our products are sold are highly competitive 
the primary raw materials for our business segments are polymer resins  films  paper  ink  adhesives  aluminum  and chemicals 
during  the cost of these raw materials generally increased  creating a short term negative impact on gross margins as a percentage of net sales 
this compares to an environment of decreasing raw material costs which created a short term positive impact on gross margins during acquisition of alcan packaging food americas on march   bemis completed its acquisition of the food americas operations of alcan packaging  a business unit of rio tinto plc 
under the terms of the billion transaction  bemis acquired food americas flexible packaging facilities in the united states  canada  mexico  brazil  argentina  and new zealand  which recorded net sales totaling billion 
these facilities are included in our flexible packaging business segment and produce flexible packaging principally for the food and beverage industries and augment bemis product offerings and technological capabilities 
the majority of the financing for this transaction was completed during the third quarter of through the issuance of million of public bonds and million common shares issued in a secondary public stock offering 
the remaining cash purchase price was financed in the commercial paper market at the time of closing 
sale of discontinued operations under the terms of an order signed by the us district court for the district of columbia on february   a portion of the food americas business acquired on march  was to be divested  and we have classified the related operating results as discontinued operations 
on july   we sold these discontinued operations to exopack holding corp  an affiliate of private investment firm sun capital partners  inc the transaction was completed for a cash purchase price  net of selling costs  of million 
the divested business recorded net sales of approximately million and included two facilities which manufacture flexible packaging for retail natural cheese and shrink bags for fresh red meat 
results of operations consolidated overview in millions  except per share amounts net sales net income attributable to bemis company  inc diluted earnings per share 
table of contents versus net sales for the year ended december  increased by percent 
we estimate that acquisitions increased net sales by approximately percent during the year 
the effect of currency translations accounted for a percent increase in net sales 
net of these impacts  the increase in net sales primarily reflects higher prices and improved unit sales volume from both existing and acquired operations 
selling prices were increased during in response to higher raw material costs 
diluted earnings per share for of included a charge for transaction related legal  accounting and other professional fees  a charge associated with purchase accounting adjustments for inventory and order backlog  as well as a charge for acquisition related integration costs including severance costs for workforce reductions and equipment relocation costs 
in addition  the pre closing impact of the july financing of the food americas acquisition reduced diluted earnings by per share 
diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were in for the year ended december   diluted earnings per share included a per share charge representing the impact of acquisition related professional fees  acquisition financing  and an administrative sales tax assessment  and severance charges  partially offset by a per share gain on the sale of an asset 
operating results for the year ended december  improved with increased unit sales volume  currency translation benefits  and the accretive effect of the food americas acquisition 
versus for the year ended december   net sales decreased percent 
the effect of currency translation decreased net sales by percent in  while the june acquisition of a flexible packaging company in south america contributed percent to net sales growth 
net of these impacts  the decline in net sales during primarily reflects lower unit sales volumes in both business segments 
diluted earnings per share were for  a percent decrease compared to per share for for the year ended december   diluted earnings per share included a per share charge representing the impact of acquisition related professional fees  acquisition financing  and administrative sales tax assessment  and severance charges  partially offset by a per share gain on the sale of an asset 
operating results for the year ended december  benefited from an increased proportion of net sales of value added products and decreasing input costs during the first half of the year 
flexible packaging business segment our flexible packaging business segment provides packaging to a variety of end markets  including applications for meat and cheese  confectionery and snack  frozen foods  lawn and garden  health and hygiene  beverages  healthcare  bakery  and dry foods 
dollars in millions net sales operating profit see note to the consolidated financial statements operating profit as a percentage of net sales versus net sales in our flexible packaging business segment increased percent in acquisitions increased net sales by approximately percent  and currency effects accounted for a sales increase of percent 
the remaining increase in net sales was driven by higher sales across many market categories 
operating profit increased to million  or percent of net sales  in  compared to million  or percent of net sales in the net effect of currency translation increased operating profit in by million compared to the decrease in operating profit as a percentage of net sales in reflects the combined impact of generally lower operating margins from the acquired business and the short term negative impact of higher raw material costs in advance of selling price adjustments 
in addition  operating profit includes million of acquisition related charges 
operating margins in benefited from decreasing raw material costs during the first half of that year 
versus net sales in our flexible packaging business segment decreased percent in currency effects accounted for a sales decline of percent compared to and the south american rigid operations of huhtamaki oyj  acquired in june  accounted for million of net sales following the acquisition  increasing net sales by percent 
the remaining percent decrease in net sales reflects both lower selling prices and unit sales volume 
generally lower net sales of flexible packaging reflected decreased consumer demand 
operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased to percent in from percent in this improvement reflects the combined impact of improved sales mix and production efficiency initiatives  as well as lower input costs experienced during the first half of the improvement in sales mix during is attributable to an increased proportion of net sales represented by value added packaging which incorporates consumer convenience features and extends shelf life 
net sales of packaging for less complex applications generally experienced the largest unit volume decrease during in comparison  operating margins during were negatively impacted by dramatic increases in raw material costs during the summer months 
pressure sensitive materials business segment the pressure sensitive materials business segment offers adhesive products to three markets prime and variable information labels  which include roll label stock used in a wide variety of label markets  graphic design  used to create signage and decorations  and 
table of contents technical components  which represent pressure sensitive components for industries such as the electronics  automotive  construction and medical industries 
paper and adhesive are the primary raw materials used in our pressure sensitive materials business segment 
for the last several years  general economic conditions and competitive pressures have had a greater influence on selling prices and operating performance than raw material costs 
dollars in millions net sales operating profit see note to the consolidated financial statements operating profit as a percentage of net sales versus for the total year  net sales of pressure sensitive materials were million  a percent increase from net sales in currency effects accounted for a net sales decline of percent 
the resulting percent increase in net sales reflects the increase in unit sales volumes in compared to when economic conditions negatively impacted demand for our pressure sensitive materials products 
the net effect of currency translation decreased operating profit by million in higher operating profit in reflects the positive impact of substantially improved unit sales volumes combined with disciplined cost management 
versus our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales decrease of percent in currency effects accounted for a net sales decline of percent 
the balance of the decrease reflects dramatically lower unit sales volumes compared to the markets for our graphic and technical products  which represent about percent of total business segment sales  experienced significant demand declines in light of weak global economic conditions  resulting in net sales declines for those products in excess of percent 
operating profit as a percent of net sales was lower in compared to  reflecting the decline in unit sales volumes  particularly in high value added graphic and technical product lines 
operating profit in includes severance charges totaling million related to workforce reductions intended to better match capacity levels with current production needs 
consolidated gross profit dollars in millions gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross profit in reflects the negative impact of million of expenses associated with the purchase accounting impact of the fair value write up of inventory and a charge for the fair value of the customer order backlog  both related to the food americas acquisition 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in is attributable to lower operating margins in the newly acquired food americas business combined with increasing raw material costs during gross profit as a percentage of net sales in benefited from declining raw material costs for the first half of that year  resulting in a substantial improvement in this ratio compared to consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses dollars in millions selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a as a percentage of net sales selling  general  and administrative expenses increased during reflecting the increased costs associated with the newly acquired food americas business  including million of expenses primarily related to severance costs for workforce reductions and equipment relocation costs 
expenses in increased from the prior year as a result of higher benefit and incentive plan costs during that year 
the increase in the ratio of these expenses to net sales in was magnified by lower sales levels for the year ended december  as selling prices were adjusted downward to reflect decreasing raw material costs in other expenses dollars in millions research and development r d r d as a percentage of net sales interest expense effective interest rate other operating income expense  net other non operating income expense  net income taxes 
table of contents effective tax rate research and development our efforts to introduce new products continue at a steady pace and are an integral part of our daily plant operations 
our research and development engineers work directly on commercial production equipment  bringing new products to market without the use of pilot equipment 
we believe this approach significantly improves the efficiency  effectiveness  and relevance of our research and development activities and results in earlier commercialization of new products 
expenditures that are not distinctly identifiable as research and development costs are included in costs of products sold 
interest expense interest expense increased in compared to due to the july issuance of million of long term bonds as financing for the food americas acquisition 
other operating income expense  net for the year  other operating income and expense included million of fiscal incentive income compared to million in and million in fiscal government incentives relate to certain flexible packaging locations and are considered as a part of flexible packaging operating profit 
these fiscal incentives are associated with net sales in south america and are expected to continue over the next few years 
in  the fiscal incentive income was offset by million of charges principally associated with the food americas acquisition 
during  in addition to the fiscal incentive income  other operating income and expense included million of acquisition related expenses 
other non operating income expense  net the decrease in other non operating income  net  is primarily due to lower interest income combined with net foreign exchange losses in in  increased levels of interest income reflected higher cash balances invested outside of the united states 
income taxes the difference between our overall tax rate of percent in  percent in  and percent in and the us statutory rate of percent in each of the three years presented principally relates to state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefits 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests noncontrolling interests primarily represent the outstanding preferred shares of dixie toga  our brazilian flexible packaging subsidiary 
liquidity and capital resources debt to total capitalization net debt to total capitalization which includes total debt net of cash balances plus equity was percent at december   compared to percent at december   and percent at december  the december  calculation of net debt to total capitalization excluded billion of cash on hand related to the acquisition financing proceeds received in advance of the march  closing of the food americas acquisition 
total debt was  million   million  and million  at december    and  respectively 
the increase in debt during reflects million of public bonds issued in july in anticipation of the alcan packaging food americas acquisition  offset by a reduction in commercial paper and other debt outstanding 
credit rating our capital structure and financial practices have earned us investment grade credit ratings from two nationally recognized credit rating agencies 
these credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest 
net cash flow from operations net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in changes in working capital had a significant impact on cash provided by operations during the years presented 
lower raw material costs during reduced overall working capital needs compared to  while increasing raw material costs negatively impacted working capital levels during net cash provided by operations was reduced by voluntary pension contributions to our us pension plans of million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
required contributions for our us pension plans are expected to be less than million in available financing in addition to using cash provided by operations  we issue commercial paper to meet our short term liquidity needs 
at year end  our commercial paper debt outstanding was million 
based upon our current credit rating  we enjoy ready access to the commercial paper markets 
under the terms of our revolving credit agreement  we have the capacity to borrow up to million 
this facility is principally used as back up for our commercial paper program 
our revolving credit facility is supported by a group of major us and international banks 
covenants imposed by the revolving credit facility include limits on the sale of businesses  minimum net worth calculations  and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization 
the revolving credit agreement includes a million multicurrency limit to support the financing needs of our international subsidiaries 
at december   a total of million of multicurrency loans were outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
if this revolving credit facility were no longer available to us  we would expect to 
table of contents meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market  which would increase our borrowing costs 
borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to a variable interest rate 
commercial paper outstanding at december   has been classified as long term debt in accordance with our intention and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis 
the related back up revolving credit agreement expires on april  liquidity outlook on december   our revolving credit facility supported total commercial paper outstanding of million  industrial revenue bonds outstanding of million  and multicurrency loans outstanding of million 
as a result  we had the capacity to borrow an additional million under the credit facility as of december  management expects cash flow from operations and available liquidity described above to be sufficient to support operations going forward 
there can be no assurance  however  that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by future capital market disruptions 
in addition  increases in raw material costs would increase our short term liquidity needs 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million during  compared to million in  and million in over the next several years  we expect average annual capital expenditures to be less than total annual depreciation and amortization expenses 
we expect to fund capital expenditures with cash provided by operating activities 
dividends we increased our quarterly cash dividend by percent during the first quarter of to cents per share from cents per share 
this follows increases of percent in and percent in in february  the board of directors approved the th consecutive annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to cents per share  a percent increase 
share repurchases during  we purchased million shares of our common stock in the open market 
due to the ongoing negotiation of the food americas acquisition  no shares were repurchased during during  we purchased million shares of our common stock in the open market 
as of december   we were authorized to purchase up to million additional shares of our common stock for the treasury 
contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations  operating lease obligations  and certain other purchase obligations as of december  capital leases are insignificant 
contractual payments due by period less than to to more than in millions total year years years years long term debt obligations interest expense operating leases purchase obligations postretirement obligations total pursuant to current authoritative accounting guidance  the company has accrued income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions 
these liabilities have been excluded from the table above due to the high degree of uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
a portion of this debt is commercial paper backed by a bank credit facility that expires on april  a portion of the interest expense disclosed is subject to variable interest rates 
the amounts disclosed above assume that variable interest rates are equal to rates at december  we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the options to renew the lease 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials  utilities  capital equipment and various other goods and services 
postretirement obligations represent contracts or commitments for postretirement healthcare benefits and benefit payments for the unfunded bemis supplemental retirement plan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our postretirement benefit obligations 

table of contents market risks and foreign currency exposures we enter into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes 
our use of derivative instruments is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control  counterparty risk  and ongoing reporting 
these derivative instruments are designed to reduce the income statement volatility associated with movement in foreign exchange rates and to achieve greater exposure to variable interest rates 
a portion of the interest expense on our outstanding debt is subject to short term interest rates 
as such  increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay 
for each one percent increase in variable interest rates  the annual interest expense on million of variable rate debt outstanding would increase by million 
our international operations enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
at december  and  we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively 
forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than six months 
counterparties to the forward exchange contracts are major financial institutions 
credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated 
we have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments 
the net settlement amount fair value related to the active forward foreign currency exchange contracts is recorded on the balance sheet within current liabilities and as an element of other operating income expense  net  which offsets the related transactions gains and losses on the related foreign denominated asset or liability 
amounts recognized in income related to forward exchange contracts were million income and million income in the years ended december  and  respectively 
our business in brazil holds us dollar denominated debt which creates exposure to changes in currency rates when compared to its functional currency of the brazilian real 
in order to hedge this exposure  we enter into currency swaps with maturities that match the underlying debt  effectively converting a portion of the us denominated debt to the local currency 
we have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments 
at december   and december   the company had outstanding currency swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively 
the net settlement amount fair value related to active swap contracts is recorded on the balance sheet as either a current or long term asset or liability and as an expense element of other operating income expense  net  which offsets the related transaction gains or losses 
amounts recognized in income related to these currency swaps were million expense and million expense in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the operating results of our international operations are recorded in local currency and translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes 
the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was an increase of million in and a decrease of million in operating profit increased by approximately million in and decreased by million in as a result of foreign currency translation 
shareholders equity includes adjustments to other comprehensive income for changes in currency translation for consolidated balance sheet accounts 
the impact of currency translation during was an increase in shareholders equity totaling million 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to retirement benefits  intangible assets  goodwill  and expected future performance of operations 
our estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities  and the valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill 
pension costs amounts related to our defined benefit pension plans that are recognized in our financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
the accounting for our pension plans requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet 
a substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the united states 
net periodic pension cost recorded in was million  compared to pension cost of million in and million in one element used in determining annual pension income and expense in accordance with accounting rules is the expected return on plan assets 
for the year  we maintained a target allocation to equity investments of percent of total assets and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent 
to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption  we considered compound historical returns and future expectations based upon our target asset allocation 
for the historical long term investment periods of   and years ending december   our pension plan assets earned annualized rates of return of percent  percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
using our target asset allocation of plan assets of percent equity securities and percent fixed income securities  our 
table of contents outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long term rates of return and  based on their results  we have determined our assumptions to be reasonable 
this assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over approximately three years 
this process calculates the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods 
the net deferral of asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of pension plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income and expense 
at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities 
this discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look to changes in rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   for our us defined benefit pension plans we determined this rate to be percent  a decrease of one half of one percent from the percent rate used at december  for our non us pension plans  we follow similar methodologies in determining the appropriate expected rates of return on assets and discount rates to be used in our actuarial calculations in each individual country 
pension assumptions sensitivity analysis based upon current assumptions of percent for the discount rate and percent for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets  we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for to be in a range of million to million 
the following charts depict the sensitivity of estimated pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on assets 
total increase decrease to pension expense dollars in millions from current assumptions discount rate percent percent percent percent current assumption percent percent percent rate of return on plan assets percent percent percent percent current assumption percent percent percent the amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as an asset  in the case of an overfunded plan  or as a liability  in the case of an underfunded plan 
the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
the following chart depicts the sensitivity of the total pension adjustment to other comprehensive income to changes in the assumed discount rate 
total increase decrease in accumulated other comprehensive dollars in millions income  net of taxes  from current assumptions discount rate percent percent percent percent current assumption percent percent percent intangible assets and goodwill the purchase price of each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets  liabilities assumed  and goodwill 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  including intangible assets 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually and assess whether significant events or changes in the business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
goodwill was billion as of december  intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology  customer relationships  patents  trademarks  and tradenames and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from one to years  when purchased 
we review 
table of contents these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
these estimates and projections require judgments as to future events  condition  and amounts of future cash flows 
new accounting pronouncements accounting guidance adopted in the year ended december  fair value measurements and disclosures in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued additional authoritative guidance regarding fair value measurements and disclosures 
this guidance requires that information be provided about asset movements among levels and of the fair value hierarchy  requires expanded disclosures in the roll forward of level activity  and provides clarifications on certain existing disclosure requirements 
the majority of the guidance was effective for the company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  and did not impact its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
accounting guidance not yet adopted fair value measurements and disclosures a portion of the guidance issued by the fasb in january referenced above  related to expanded disclosures in the roll forward of level activity  is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  this portion of the guidance will expand the company s disclosures and will not impact its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
forward looking statements this annual report contains certain estimates  predictions  and other forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of  and within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements are generally identified with the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  target  may  will  plan  project  should  continue  or the negative thereof or other similar expressions  or discussion of future goals or aspirations  which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters

factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expected include  but are not limited to  general economic conditions caused by inflation  interest rates  consumer confidence  rates of unemployment and foreign currency exchange rates  investment performance of assets in our pension plans  competitive conditions within our markets  including the acceptance of our new and existing products  threats or challenges to our patented or proprietary technologies  raw material costs and availability  particularly for polymer resins and adhesives  the magnitude and volatility of price changes for raw materials and our ability to pass these price changes on to our customers in selling prices or otherwise manage commodity price fluctuation risks  changes in the availability of financing  the presence of adequate cash available for investment in our business in order to maintain desired debt levels  unexpected costs or manufacturing issues related to the implementation of an enterprise resource system  costs associated with the pursuit of business combinations  unexpected costs associated with acquisitions or divestitures  changes in governmental regulations  especially in the areas of environmental  health and safety matters  and foreign investment  unexpected outcomes in our current and future litigation proceedings and any related proceedings or civil lawsuits  unexpected outcomes in our current and future domestic and international tax proceedings  changes in our labor relations  and the impact of changes in the world political environment including threatened or actual armed conflict 
these and other risks  uncertainties  and assumptions identified from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission  including without limitation  those described under item a risk factors of this annual report on form k and our quarterly reports on form q  could cause actual future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
in addition  actual future results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statement as a result of changes in the assumptions used in making such forward looking statement
