item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as factors described in part i  item a risk factors 
overview strategic direction of our business we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize our pegylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms  which are designed to improve the benefits of drugs for patients 
our current proprietary product pipeline is comprised of drug candidates across a number of therapeutic areas  including oncology  pain  anti infectives  anti viral and immunology 
our research and development activities involve small molecule drugs  peptides and other potential biologic drug candidates 
we create our innovative drug candidates by using our proprietary advanced polymer conjugate technologies and expertise to modify the chemical structure of drugs to create new molecular entities 
polymer chemistry is a science focused on the synthesis or bonding of polymer architectures with drug molecules to alter the properties of the molecule when it is bonded with polymers 
additionally  we may utilize established pharmacologic targets to engineer a new drug candidate relying on a combination of the known properties of these targets and our proprietary polymer chemistry technology and expertise 
our drug candidates are designed to improve the pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics  half life  bioavailability  metabolism or distribution of drugs and improve the overall benefits and use of a drug for the patient 
our objective is to apply our advanced polymer conjugate technology platform to create new drugs in multiple therapeutic areas 
during  we continued to make substantial investments to advance our pipeline of drug candidates from early stage discovery research through clinical development 
in  we continued to advance phase clinical trials for nktr topoisomerase i inhibitor polymer conjugate in platinum resistant refractory ovarian cancer  metastatic breast cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer 
the phase clinical trial in metastatic breast cancer patients was fully enrolled in with patients continuing in the study into in  we expanded the phase clinical trial by patients in platinum resistant refractory ovarian cancer patients and on march   we announced that we intended to further expand this study by up to additional patients 
we expect this expansion trial to continue to enroll in the phase clinical study in metastatic colorectal cancer patients is still enrolling 
enrollment in the colorectal cancer study has been challenging due to the fact that the comparator arm of this study  single agent irinotecan  is not the standard of care for second line metastatic colorectal therapy in the united states or europe 
in december  we announced that we were planning to take nktr into phase clinical development prior to seeking a collaboration partner 
we are currently planning a comparative phase clinical study for nktr in metastatic breast cancer and plan to start this study in late in addition  we will also continue the expanded phase clinical trial in platinum resistant refractory patients to evaluate the potential of an early submission of a new drug application to the united states food and drug administration depending on our assessment of those expanded study results 
the size  scope and timing of our investment in a comparative phase clinical study in platinum resistant refractory ovarian cancer will depend upon a number of important variables including our evaluation of the expanded phase study results  discussions with health authorities and key opinion leaders  evolving regulatory standards and requirements  and the estimated cost of these studies 
we anticipate our phase development plans for nktr to require substantial investment over the next several years 
our focus on research and clinical development requires substantial investments that continue to increase as we advance each drug candidate through each phase of the development cycle 
in addition to advancing our proprietary programs that are currently in clinical development  we are committed to continuing to make significant investments to advance new opportunities from our earlier stage research discovery pipeline 
for example  we plan to start a phase clinical study for nktr in the first half of while we believe that our substantial investment in research and development has the potential to create significant value if one or more of our drug candidates demonstrates positive clinical results and or receives regulatory approval in one or more major markets  
table of contents drug research and development is an inherently uncertain process and there is a high risk of failure at every stage prior to approval and the timing and outcome of clinical trial results is extremely difficult to predict 
clinical development successes and failures can have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on our scientific and medical prospects  financial prospects  financial condition  and market value 
we have a number of existing license and collaboration agreements with third parties in which we have an economic interest and could have a material impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in particular  the future clinical and commercial success or failure of our collaboration with astrazeneca for nktr and nktr and our collaboration with bayer for amikacin inhale will have a material impact on our business and financial condition over the next several years 
in addition  the amount of revenue that we derive from ucb s cimzia  roche s mircera  map s levadex tm and affymax s hematide tm  among other of our collaboration agreements  will together have a material impact on our business  financial results and cash position 
because drug development and commercialization is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  there is a substantial risk that our future revenue from one or more of these agreements will be less than we project in our business plans 
historically  we have entered into a number of license and supply contracts under which we manufactured and supplied our proprietary pegylation reagents on a cost plus or fixed price basis 
our current strategy is to manufacture and supply pegylation reagents to support our proprietary drug candidates or for third party collaborators where we have a strategic development and commercialization relationship or where we derive substantial economic benefit 
as a result  whenever possible  we are renegotiating or not seeking renewal of legacy manufacturing supply arrangements that do not include a strategic development or commercialization component 
for example  in october we entered into a supply  dedicated suite and manufacturing guarantee agreement with amgen inc and amgen manufacturing  limited  which has significantly amended economic and other terms in the non exclusive supply and license agreement we previously entered into with amgen in july in addition  in december we entered into an amended manufacturing and supply agreement with merck through its subsidiary schering to provide for transfer to an alternative manufacturer and revised economics for an interim supply arrangement until that transition is completed 
key developments and trends in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments and million in indebtedness 
on january   we completed a public offering of our common stock with proceeds of approximately million 
additionally  as part of the public offering  we incurred approximately million in legal and accounting fees  filing fees  and other offering expenses 
we have million in outstanding convertible subordinated notes due september we do not have sufficient resources to fund our research and development plans and repay these convertible notes 
we have no material credit facility or other material committed sources of capital 
we expect the phase clinical studies of nktr to require particularly significant resources because we anticipate bearing a majority or all of the development costs for that drug candidate 
prior to the maturity of the convertible notes  we plan to explore a number of alternatives to provide for the repayment of the notes  including restructuring the notes 
we have financed our operations primarily through revenue from product sales and royalties  development and commercialization collaboration contracts and debt and equity financings 
while in the past we have received a number of significant payments from license and collaboration agreements and other significant transactions  we do not currently anticipate receiving substantial payments for new transactions in the near future 
to date we have incurred substantial debt as a result of our issuances of subordinated notes that are convertible into our common stock 
our substantial debt  the market price of our securities  and the general economic climate  among other factors  could have material consequences for our financial condition and could affect our sources of short term and long term funding 
our ability to meet our ongoing operating expenses and repay our outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon our and our partners ability to successfully complete clinical development of  obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize new drugs 
even if we or our partners are successful  we may require additional capital to continue to fund our operations and repay our debt obligations as they become due 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if and when required  will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all

product sales and royalties license  collaboration and other total revenue total revenue increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the recognition of the remaining million of the million upfront payment received from astrazeneca ab for nktr and nktr in the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   recognition of amounts received from astrazeneca ab represented of our total revenue 
total revenue decreased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of the sale of certain of our pulmonary assets to novartis completed on december  novartis pulmonary asset sale and lower product manufacturing volumes required by our collaboration partners 
in connection with the novartis pulmonary asset sale  our collaboration agreement with novartis for tip was terminated and our collaboration agreement with bayer schering pharma ag for cipro inhale was assigned to novartis 
for the year ended december   two of our partners  astrazeneca ab and ucb pharma  represented and  respectively  of our total revenue 
product sales and royalties product sales include cost plus and fixed price manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners 
we also receive royalty revenue from certain of our collaboration partners based on their net sales once their products are approved for commercial sale 
royalty revenues were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease in product sales and royalties for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is attributable to decreased product sales of million partially offset by increased royalty revenue of million 
the timing of shipments is based on the demand and requirements of our collaboration partners and is not ratable throughout the year 
we expect product sales and royalties to decrease in due to decreased product sales partially offset by increased royalty revenues 
lower product demand from our collaboration partners resulted in decreased product sales of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   an increase in royalties of approximately million partially offset the decrease in product sales compared to the year ended december  license  collaboration and other revenue license  collaboration and other revenue includes amortization of upfront payments and performance milestone payments received in connection with our license and collaboration agreements and reimbursed research and development expenses 
the level of license  collaboration and other revenues depends in part upon the estimated amortization period of the upfront and milestone payments  the achievement of future milestones  the continuation of existing collaborations  the amount of reimbursed research and development work  and the signing of new collaborations 

table of contents for the year ended december   the increase in license  collaboration and other revenue compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to recognition of the upfront payment received from astrazeneca for nktr and nktr in the fourth quarter of  contract research and other revenue from astrazeneca  and the recognition of the license extension option payment received from roche in december under the astrazeneca license agreement and related technology transfer agreement  we recognized million and million of the million upfront payment and million and million of contract research and other revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we recognized million and million  respectively  of the million license extension option payment from roche for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in license  collaboration and other revenue for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to elimination of any revenue from novartis related to tip and from bayer schering pharma ag for cipro inhale as a result of the novartis pulmonary asset sale 
in addition  included revenue related to a new intellectual property license agreement we entered into with roche and higher revenue from bayer under our collaboration agreement for bay this decrease is partially off set by million in revenue recognized related to our agreement with astrazeneca for nktr and nktr we expect license  collaboration and other revenue to substantially decrease in due to the complete recognition as of december  of the upfront payment we received under the astrazeneca license agreement 
the timing and future success of our drug development programs and those of our collaboration partners are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties

research development expense research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs  including salaries  benefits and stock based compensation  clinical study costs  including direct costs of contract research organizations cros and other vendors  direct costs of outside research  materials and supplies  licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs 
the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an million increase in salaries and employee benefits due to increased headcount to support our expanded clinical efforts and further investment in and development of our research capabilities and pipeline 
the increase also includes a million increase in non cash stock based compensation expense due to our higher stock price and increased headcount  a million increase to facilities and equipment costs primarily due to the completion of our india research facility and to the move to our new facility in the mission bay area of san francisco  california mission bay facility  and a million increase in supplies  including clinical trial materials 
these expense increases were partially offset by a million decrease in outside services  including contract research organizations  due primarily to lower expenses for the nktr and nktr programs as a result of our successful completion of phase clinical studies and collaboration with astrazeneca pursuant to the license agreement entered into in september the decrease in research and development expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to the divestiture of certain pulmonary research and development programs as part of the novartis pulmonary asset sale 
research and development expense related to the divested pulmonary programs totaled million for the year ended december  which was comprised of facility  employee related and other costs 
additionally  in we recorded approximately million in other expenses related to the workforce reduction completed in february and additional severance costs related to the novartis pulmonary asset sale 
we utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development projects as well as our research programs directed towards identifying other product candidates based on our technology platform

as shown in the table above  our most significant investments in specific development programs in included nktr  bay amikacin inhale  formerly nktr  nktr  nktr  and nktr in addition  we continue to actively perform research and pre clinical development of other drug candidates based on our proprietary advanced polymer conjugate technology platform 
we expect research and development expense will substantially increase over the next several years 
we plan to continue to advance nktr in phase clinical trials for breast  ovarian and colorectal cancers 
in  we are completing our phase clinical trial in metastatic breast cancer patients and we are currently planning a comparative phase clinical development program in metastatic breast cancer patients that we plan to start by the end of our expanded phase clinical trial in platinum resistant refractory ovarian cancer patients will continue throughout we are currently also evaluating various options for phase clinical development of nktr in platinum resistant refractory ovarian cancer patients 
at the same time  we will also be advancing the phase clinical study for nktr in colorectal cancer patients and we expect to continue to enroll patients throughout and beyond 
in december  we announced that we intended to continue development of nktr into phase clinical development prior to completing a collaboration partnership for this drug candidate 
as such  we will be funding all of the clinical development costs for nktr without reimbursement from a collaboration partner for the foreseeable future 
the clinical development costs for nktr will be significant and we have not yet completed our phase planning 
as a result  we do not currently have any estimate of the dates or costs to complete the clinical development efforts for any of the cancer indications in which we are studying nktr in  we will be investing in a phase clinical study for nktr an abuse deterrent  tamper resistant opioid that we expect to start and complete in in addition  we plan to continue to make substantial 
table of contents investments to support the clinical and commercial manufacturing preparation and scale up for the inhaler devices to supply bayer for the amikacin inhale program 
under our collaboration agreement with bayer  we are responsible for all clinical and commercial supply of the inhaler devices for amikacin inhale 
we do not expect to have any significant future research and development costs associated with nktr and nktr as astrazeneca is responsible for all further development and commercialization costs for these drug candidates 
in addition to our programs that will be in clinical development in  we believe it is important to continue our substantial investment in a diverse pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build on the value of our business 
our discovery research organization is identifying new drug candidates by applying our technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes  including small molecules and large proteins  peptides and antibodies  across multiple therapeutic areas 
we plan to continue to advance our most promising early research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective to advance these early stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years 
our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
in order to advance our product candidates through clinical development  the product candidates are tested in numerous preclinical safety  toxicology and efficacy studies 
we then conduct clinical trials for our drug candidates that take several years to complete 
the cost and time required to complete clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a clinical development program as a result of a variety of factors  including but not limited to the number of patients required to fully enroll a clinical trial  the length of time required to enroll clinical trial participants  the number and location of sites included in the clinical trials  the clinical trial designs required by the health authorities ie primary and secondary end points  the potential for changing standards of care for the target patient population  the competition for patient recruitment from competitive drug candidates being studied in the same clinical setting  the costs of producing supplies of the product candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions  the safety and efficacy profile of the drug candidate  the use of clinical research organizations to assist with the management of the trials  and the costs and timing of  and the ability to secure  regulatory approvals 
furthermore  our strategy includes entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of some of our drug candidates such as nktr  nktr  and amikacin inhale 
in these situations  the clinical trial process for a drug candidate and the estimated completion date will largely be under the control of that third party and not under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in item a risk factors 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects  anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from a collaboration arrangement or the commercialization of a drug candidate

as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of million and indebtedness of million  including million of convertible subordinated notes  million in capital lease obligations and million in other liabilities 
additionally at december   we had letter of credit arrangements with certain financial institutions and vendors  including our landlord  totaling million 
these letters of credit will expire during and are secured by investments of similar amounts 
on january   we completed a public offering of our common stock with proceeds of approximately million 
additionally  as part of the public offering  we incurred approximately million in legal and accounting fees  filing fees  and other offering expenses 
we will likely not have sufficient capital to fund the development of the drug candidates in our current research and development pipeline  fund late stage clinical development of nktr and repay the million convertible notes when they become due in september we have no material credit facility or other material committed sources of capital 
we expect the phase clinical trials of nktr to require particularly significant 
table of contents resources because we anticipate bearing a majority or all of the development costs for that drug candidate 
prior to the maturity of the convertible notes  we plan to explore a number of alternatives to provide for the repayment of the convertible notes  including restructuring the convertible notes 
despite these efforts  we may be unable to find a commercially acceptable alternative or any alternative to repaying the notes by september please refer to part i  item a  risk factors  we will need to restructure our convertible notes or raise substantial additional capital to repay the notes and fund operations  and we may be unable to restructure the notes or raise such capital when needed and on acceptable terms 
due to the potential for continued uncertainty in the credit markets in  we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our short term investments 
these investments are generally held to maturity  which is less than one year 
however  if the need arose to liquidate such securities before maturity  we may experience losses on liquidation 
as of december   we held million of available for sale investments  excluding money market funds  with an average time to maturity of days 
based on our available cash and our expected operating cash requirements  we do not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities before we recover the amortized cost basis 
to date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities  but should such issues arise  we may be required to hold some  or all  of these securities until maturity 
we believe that  even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities  our remaining cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
cash flows from operating activities during the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities totaled million  which primarily consisted of spending on operating costs and expenses and includes million for interest payments on our convertible subordinated notes  and was partially offset by a million upfront payment received from amgen under the supply  dedicated suite and manufacturing guarantee agreement that we entered into with amgen in october we expect that cash flows used in operating activities  excluding upfront payments received  if any  will increase in as a result of increased spending on our proprietary research and development programs 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  which included the million upfront payment received from astrazeneca under the license agreement we entered into for nktr and nktr and a million license extension payment received from roche in december during the year ended december   net cash used for our operating activities was million  which included a number of significant items including a million clinical development milestone received from bayer healthcare llc under our collaboration agreement for amikacin inhale  payments by us to bespak europe ltd
