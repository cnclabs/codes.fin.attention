item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share and warehouse number data overview we believe that the most important driver of increasing our profitability is sales growth  particularly comparable sales growth sales in warehouses open for at least one year 
comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing the frequency with which our members shop and the amounts they spend on each visit 
sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by two factors that are beyond our control  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions primarily impacting domestic operations 
the higher our comparable sales the more we can leverage certain of our selling  general and administrative expenses  reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability 
generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices  a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term 
another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business  especially the united states 
sales growth and our gross margin are also impacted by our competition  which is vigorous and widespread  including a wide range of global  national and regional wholesalers and retailers  including supermarkets  supercenter stores  department and specialty stores  gasoline stations  and internet based retailers 
while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition  we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes  such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix  including increasing the penetration of our private label items 
our philosophy is not to focus in the short term on maximizing prices that our members can be charged but to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our pricing authority consistently providing the most competitive values 
this may cause us  for example  to absorb increases in merchandise costs at certain times rather than immediately passing them along to our members  negatively impacting gross margin 
we also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses and relocating existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities 
as our warehouse base grows  available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure  and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth 
however  the negative aspects of such growth  including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets  are ameliorated 
our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign markets  due to the smaller base in those markets  and we expect that to continue 
our financial performance also depends heavily on our ability to control costs 
while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically  some significant costs are partially outside our control  most particularly health care and utility expenses 
with respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees  our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn 
rather  we believe that achieving our longer term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce 
this may cause us  for example  to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces 
because our business is operated on low margins  modest changes in various items in the income statement  particularly gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses  can have substantial impacts on net income 
key items for included net sales increased to  driven by a increase in comparable sales and sales at the net new warehouses opened in fiscal net sales were favorably impacted by increases in the price of gasoline and by foreign currencies strengthening against the us dollar

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share and warehouse number data continued derivatives we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business 
we manage these fluctuations  in part  through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts  seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency 
the contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge our exposure to us dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries or other entities whose functional currency is other than the us dollar 
currently  these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting 
we seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions 
these contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features 
we seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships 
there can be no assurance  however  that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk 
these contracts are limited to less than one year in duration 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for additional information on the fair value of open  unsettled forward foreign exchange contracts as of august   and august  we are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume  particularly electricity and natural gas  which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately of our warehouses and other facilities  primarily in the us and canada 
we also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas  in addition to fuel for our gas stations  on an index basis 
these contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no mark to market adjustment 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share and warehouse number data continued recognition  investments  merchandise inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  warehouse closing costs  insurance self insurance liabilities  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
revenue recognition we generally recognize sales  net of estimated returns  at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services 
when we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services  the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed 
we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns  net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs 
amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis 
we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions 
generally  when we are the primary obligor  subject to inventory risk  have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers  influence product or service specifications  or have several but not all of these indicators  revenue is recorded on a gross basis 
if we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above  we record the net amounts as commissions earned  which is reflected in net sales 
membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members 
we account for membership fee revenue  net of estimated refunds  on a deferred basis  whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period 
our executive members qualify for a reward which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses  up to a maximum of approximately per year  on qualified purchases made at costco 
we account for this reward as a reduction in sales  with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities 
the sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data 
investments investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
we employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer  including industry and sector performance  operational and financing cash flow factors  and rating agency actions 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
if market  industry  and or issuer conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  as determined primarily by the retail inventory method  and are stated using the last in  first out lifo method for substantially all us merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first in  first out fifo method 
we believe the lifo method 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share and warehouse number data continued more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues 
we record an adjustment each quarter  if necessary  for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation  and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end 
due to inflation  in the merchandise inventories valued at lifo were lower than the fifo value  resulting in a charge to merchandise costs of during  due to overall net deflationary trends  the company recorded a benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at lifo 
at the end of and  merchandise inventories valued at lifo approximated fifo after considering the lower of cost or market principle 
we provide for estimated inventory losses shrink between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales 
the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts  which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year 
inventory cost  where appropriate  is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates  provided they are probable and reasonably estimable 
other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones  terms of agreement  or other systematic and rational approaches 
impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs we periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment  such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility 
our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist  requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value 
we provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated 
judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability  particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations 
these estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets 
we make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location 
we reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change 
insurance self insurance liabilities we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms  including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool  to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation  general liability  property damage  directors and officers liability  vehicle liability  and employee health care benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions 
the benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities 
when facts and circumstances change  we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate
