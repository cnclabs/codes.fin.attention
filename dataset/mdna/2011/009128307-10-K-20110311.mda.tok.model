item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this report 
this report  including the information incorporated by reference  contains forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of the use of any of the words believe  expect  anticipate  plan  estimate  and similar expressions are intended to identify such statements 
forward looking statements include statements concerning our possible or assumed future results  flight volume and collection rates for cbs operations  size  structure and growth of our air medical services and products markets  continuation and or renewal of hbs contracts  acquisition of new and profitable products division contracts  and other matters 
the actual results that we achieve may differ materially from those discussed in such forward looking statements due to the risks and uncertainties described in the risk factors section of this report  in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in other sections of this report  as well as in our quarterly reports on form q 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
overview we provide air medical transportation services throughout the united states and design  manufacture  and install medical aircraft interiors and other aerospace and medical transport products 
our divisions  or business segments  are organized according to the type of service or product provided and consist of the following community based services cbs provides air medical transportation services to the general population as an independent service 
revenue consists of flight fees billed directly to patients  their insurers  or governmental agencies  and cash flow is dependent upon collection from these individuals or entities 
in the cbs division generated of our total revenue  compared to in and in hospital based services hbs provides air medical transportation services to hospitals throughout the us under exclusive operating agreements 
revenue consists primarily of fixed monthly fees approximately of total contract revenue and hourly flight fees approximately of total contract revenue billed to hospital customers 
in the hbs division generated of our total revenue  compared to in and in products division designs  manufactures  and installs aircraft medical interiors and other aerospace and medical transport products for domestic and international customers 
in the products division generated of our total revenue  compared to in and in see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for operating results by segment 
we believe that the following factors have the greatest impact on our results of operations and financial condition flight volume 
fluctuations in flight volume have a greater impact on cbs operations than hbs operations because almost all of cbs revenue is derived from flight fees  as compared to approximately of hbs revenue 
by contrast  of our costs primarily associated with flight operations including salaries  aircraft ownership costs  hull insurance  and general and administrative expenses incurred during the year ended december   are mainly fixed in nature 
while flight volume is affected by many factors  including competition and the effectiveness of marketing and business development initiatives  the greatest single variable has historically been weather conditions 
adverse weather conditions such as fog  high winds  or heavy precipitation hamper our ability to operate our aircraft safely and  therefore  result in reduced flight volume 
total patient transports for cbs operations were approximately  for compared to approximately  for patient transports for cbs bases open longer than one year same base transports were approximately  in compared to  in cancellations due to unfavorable weather conditions for cbs bases open longer than one year were  lower in compared to requests for community based services decreased by for the year ended december   for bases open greater than one year 

table of contents reimbursement per transport 
we respond to calls for air medical transports without pre screening the creditworthiness of the patient and are subject to collection risk for services provided to insured and uninsured patients 
medicare and medicaid also receive contractual discounts from our standard charges for flight services 
flight revenue is recorded net of provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care 
both provisions are estimated during the period the related services are performed based on historical collection experience and any known trends or changes in reimbursement rate schedules and payer mix 
the provisions are adjusted as required based on actual collections in subsequent periods 
net reimbursement per transport for cbs operations is primarily a function of price  payer mix  and timely and effective collection efforts 
both the pace of collections and the ultimate collection rate are affected by the overall health of the us economy  which impacts the number of indigent patients and funding for state run programs  such as medicaid 
medicaid reimbursement rates in many jurisdictions have remained well below the cost of providing air medical transportation 
in addition  the collection rate is impacted by changes in the cost of healthcare and health insurance  as the cost of healthcare increases  health insurance coverage provided by employers may be reduced or eliminated entirely  resulting in an increase in the uninsured population 
the impact of recently enacted healthcare legislation is still unknown 
net reimbursement per transport increased in the year ended december   compared to  attributed to recent price increases 
provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care as a percentage of related gross billings for cbs operations were as follows for years ended december  gross billings provision for contractual discounts provision for uncompensated care although price increases generally increase the net reimbursement per transport from insurance payers  the amount per transport collectible from private patient payers  medicare  and medicaid does not increase proportionately with price increases 
therefore  depending upon overall payer mix  price increases will usually result in an increase in the percentage of uncollectible accounts 
the number of transports covered by insurance decreased from of total transports for the year ended december   to of total transports for the year ended december   with most of the decrease moving to medicare coverage 
in  increased collections from insurance payers offset the impact of price increases on the percentage collectible from other payers and the deterioration in payer mix 
although we have not yet experienced significant increased limitations in the amount reimbursed by insurance companies  continued price increases may cause insurance companies to limit coverage for air medical transport to amounts less than our standard rates 
aircraft maintenance 
both cbs and hbs operations are directly affected by fluctuations in aircraft maintenance costs 
proper operation of the aircraft by flight crews and standardized maintenance practices can help to contain maintenance costs 
increases in spare parts prices from original equipment manufacturers tend to be higher for aircraft which are no longer in production 
two models of aircraft within our fleet  representing of the rotor wing fleet  are no longer in production and are  therefore  susceptible to price increases which outpace general inflationary trends 
in addition  on condition components are more likely to require replacement with age 
since january   we have taken delivery of new aircraft and expect to take delivery of a total of additional aircraft during and we have replaced discontinued models and other older aircraft with the new aircraft  as well as provided capacity for base expansion 
replacement models of aircraft typically have higher ownership costs than the models targeted for replacement but lower maintenance costs 
total maintenance expense for cbs and hbs operations increased from the year ended december   to the year ended december   while total flight volume for cbs and hbs operations decreased over the same period 
during the year ended december   we incurred costs for major maintenance events  such as engine and transmission overhauls  compared to in the year ended december   primarily because of the timing of overhaul cycles 

table of contents competitive pressures from low cost providers 
we are recognized within the industry for our standard of service and our use of cabin class aircraft 
many of our competitors utilize aircraft with lower ownership and operating costs and do not require a similar level of experience for aviation and medical personnel 
reimbursement rates established by medicare  medicaid  and most insurance providers are not contingent upon the type of aircraft used or the experience of personnel 
however  we believe that higher quality standards help to differentiate our service from competitors and  therefore  lead to higher utilization 
employee recruitment and relations 
the ability to deliver quality services is partially dependent upon our ability to hire and retain employees who have advanced aviation  nursing  and other technical skills 
in addition  hospital contracts typically contain minimum certification requirements for pilots and mechanics 
the collective bargaining agreement covering our pilots expired on april  negotiations on a new cba commenced in the fourth quarter of and were referred for mediation during the second quarter of under the railway labor act  mediation decisions are non binding on either party  and the duration of the process may vary depending upon the mediator assigned and the complexity of the issues negotiated 
no meetings were held by the mediator during the first and second quarters of  but resumed during the third quarter of although negotiations are active  no agreement has yet been reached 
other employee groups may also elect to be represented by unions in the future

decrease of approximately  due to the base closures described above 
increases in salaries for merit pay raises and in the cost of our medical insurance 
aircraft operating expenses decreased  or  for the year ended december   in comparison to the decrease in costs is due to the following decrease of  or  in aircraft maintenance expense to  primarily attributable to our fleet rejuvenation efforts and to our increasing use of single engine  rather than twin engine  aircraft 
since the first quarter of  we have placed new helicopters into service consisting of single engine aircraft  twins  and fixed wing aircraft and eliminated aircraft which were older models consisting of single engine aircraft  twins  and fixed wing aircraft 
in  as part of our fleet planning  we also utilized components from certain retired aircraft instead of purchasing replacement parts from outside vendors 
decrease of approximately in the cost of aircraft fuel per hour flown 
fuel costs decreased by  to a total expense of  for  compared to decreases in flight volume for bases open longer than one year for both cbs and hbs as described above 
increases in hull insurance rates effective july and aircraft rental expense increased  or  for the year ended december   in comparison to  due primarily to incremental rental expense of  for leased aircraft added to our fleet during either or the increase for new aircraft was offset in part by selling or refinancing aircraft at lower lease rates or through debt financing

reorganization of field based program management during the second quarter of  resulting in the elimination of fifteen positions and the transfer of other personnel into other open positions within the company 
closure of the cj patient billing office and incorporation of these functions into our existing billing department  resulting in the elimination of sixteen full time positions as well as additional contract positions 
the transition was completed during the second quarter of consolidation of corporate overhead functions 
income tax expense was  or of income before taxes  in and  or of income before taxes  in in the effective rate used to determine state income taxes decreased primarily due to a change in colorado statute defining the apportionment calculation

we plan to either sell the aircraft which are replaced  use them for spare parts  or redeploy them into the backup fleet 
typically we have financed aircraft acquired under similar commitments through operating lease or debt agreements 
if financing arrangements cannot be arranged or we are prevented from taking or decline to take delivery of aircraft under the commitments described above for any other reason  we may forfeit nonrefundable deposits of approximately million 
the amount of deposit to be forfeited may be mitigated if the aircraft manufacturer is able to remarket the commitment positions

as of december   the undiscounted maximum amount of potential future payments under the guarantees is  of this amount   relates to aircraft operating leases which were assumed in the cj acquisition 
no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses with respect to the guarantees  since it is not probable that the residual value of the aircraft will be less than the amounts stipulated in the guarantee 
the assessment of whether it is probable that we will be required to make payments under the terms of the guarantee is based on current market data and our actual and expected loss experience

we are required to maintain certain financial ratios as defined in the credit facility and other notes 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  deferred income taxes  and valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition fixed flight fee revenue under our operating agreements with hospitals is recognized monthly over the terms of the agreements 
flight revenue relating to patient transports is recognized upon completion of the services and is recorded net of provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care 
both provisions are estimated during the period the related services are performed based on historical collection experience and any known trends or changes in reimbursement rate schedules and payer mix 
the provisions are adjusted as required based on actual collections in subsequent periods 
we have from time to time experienced delays in reimbursement from third party payers 
in addition  third party payers may disallow  in whole or in part  claims for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not reimbursable under plan coverage  determinations of medical necessity  or the need for additional information 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are very complex and subject to interpretation 
we also provide services to patients who have no insurance or other third party payer coverage 
there can be no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same collection rates that we have in the past 
if actual future collections are more or less than those projected by management  adjustments to allowances for contractual discounts and uncompensated care may be required 
based on related flight revenue for the year ended december   a change of basis points in the percentage of estimated contractual discounts and uncompensated care would have resulted in a change of approximately  in flight revenue 

table of contents revenue related to fixed fee medical interior and products contracts is recorded as costs are incurred using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we estimate the percentage of completion based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of an estimate of the total costs to complete the project 
losses on contracts in process are recognized when determined 
if total costs to complete a project are greater or less than estimated  the gross margin on the project may be greater or less than originally recorded under the percentage of completion method 
deferred income taxes in preparation of the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciable assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income and record a valuation allowance for those amounts we believe are not likely to be realized 
establishing or increasing a valuation allowance in a period increases income tax expense 
we consider estimated future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in statutory tax rates applicable to the company is also recognized in income in the period of the change 
long lived assets valuation in accounting for long lived assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  projected residual values and the potential for impairment 
estimates of useful lives and residual values of aircraft are based upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
changing market prices of new and used aircraft  government regulations and changes in our maintenance program or operations could result in changes to these estimates 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted for estimated current industry trends  the economy  and operating conditions 
goodwill valuation the company s goodwill relates to four acquisitions and has been allocated to our community based and hospital based services segments 
annually  at december  the company evaluates goodwill for potential impairment using a two step test at the reporting unit level 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the book value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  with its fair value 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recorded 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the book value of the goodwill 
the amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit based upon the reporting unit s historical operating profit and the company s current public trading value 
estimated future operating profit for each reporting unit is also taken into consideration when determining the reporting unit s fair value 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of economic changes and to estimate future operating profit for the reporting units 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and patient receivable collection rates  are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts 
changes in these estimates or a continued decline in general economic conditions could change our conclusion regarding an impairment of goodwill and potentially result in a non cash impairment loss in a future period 

table of contents the estimated fair values of the reporting units have historically exceeded the carrying values of the reporting units 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on the company s public trading value and on each reporting unit s historical and estimated future operating profits 
in estimating sensitivity  either the company s current public trading value or any reporting unit s operating profit would have to decrease by more than before the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
new accounting standards in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 presentation of insurance claims and related insurance recoveries  clarifying that health care entities should not net insurance recoveries against a related claim liability 
the asu is effective for periods beginning after december  the company does not expect the implementation of asu no 
to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
all of our sales and related receivables are payable in us dollars 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and notes receivable  all of which have fixed interest rates except our line of credit which has no balance outstanding at december  and  in notes payable 
based on the amounts outstanding at december   the annual impact of a change of basis points in interest rates would be approximately  interest rates on these instruments approximate current market rates as of december  our cost of operations is also affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
generally  our hbs customers pay for all fuel consumed in medical flights 
based on actual cbs fuel usage for the year ended december   the impact on operating costs of an increase of in the cost of aircraft fuel per hour flown would be approximately  for the year  exclusive of the impact of fuel derivative agreements 
flight volume for cbs operations can vary due to weather conditions and other factors 
therefore  the impact of a change in fuel cost based on volume is not necessarily indicative of the impact on subsequent years or quarters 
we have financial derivative agreements to protect against increases in the cost of gulf coast jet fuel above per gallon for wholesale purchases from january   through december   covering approximately of our anticipated fuel consumption for
