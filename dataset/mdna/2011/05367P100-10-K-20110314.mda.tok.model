prior to and since our acquisition of pinnacle in  our organizational structure was based on three strategic business units professional video  audio and consumer video 
as part of our business transformation initiated in  we combined our professional video and consumer video business units into one video reporting unit and consolidated all our sales and marketing teams into a single customer facing organization to better align our business structure with the realities of many of our customers 
as a result  our reporting structure in was based on two business units  video and audio 
in the later part of  we completed the reorganization of our business around functional groups and began reporting based on one reportable segment starting january  financial summary the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated for the year ended december  net revenues product revenues services revenues total net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development marketing and selling general and administrative amortization of intangible assets impairment of goodwill and intangible assets restructuring and other costs  net gain on sales of assets total operating expenses operating loss interest and other income expense  net loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net loss total net revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  compared to the year ended december   with revenues from products increasing by and services revenues decreasing by 
in  compared to  video products revenues and audio products revenues increased by million and million  respectively  while services revenues decreased million 
the increase in audio product revenues included revenues of million resulting from our acquisition of euphonix 
currency exchange rates had a negative impact on our revenues for  compared to the same periods in the changes in revenues are discussed in further detail in the section titled results of operations below 
our gross margin for the year ended december  improved slightly to  compared to for this change was driven by an increase in services gross margin percentage to in  compared to in this was partially offset by a slight decrease in products gross margin percentage to in  compared to in the increase in services gross margin percentage was largely the result of management actions that have improved the utilization of services resources 
for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million  compared to a net loss of million for the net loss for included charges of million for restructuring and other costs  million for acquisition related intangible asset amortization  million for a legal settlement and million related to acquisition activities  partially offset by a gain of million resulting from certain asset sales 
the net loss for included similar charges of million for acquisition related intangible asset amortization  million for restructuring costs and million related to acquisition activities  partially offset by a gain of million from asset sales 
in june  we relocated our corporate offices to burlington  massachusetts upon expiration of our lease in tewksbury  massachusetts 
the burlington facility was chosen after reviewing many potential sites  because we believed it would best accommodate our business over the long term and provide an employee and customer friendly environment in a cost effective manner 
during  leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment related to this relocation were placed in service and resulted in fixed asset additions of approximately million  of which million represented cash expenditures 
of the million in cash expenditures  million occurred in and the remaining million occurred in during the same period  we wrote off fixed assets with gross book values and net book values of approximately million and million  respectively  that were related to the closure of our former headquarters facility 
our restructuring charges were largely the result of charges of million related to a corporate wide reorganization initiated in the fourth quarter of  million resulting from a euphonix reorganization initiated during the second quarter of and million resulting from facilities closures and revised estimates of costs related to prior plans 
cash expenditures resulting from restructuring obligations totaled approximately million for also included in our results of operations under the caption restructuring and other costs  net  were costs of million related to our exit from our former headquarters facility 
we may engage in additional reorganizations or cost reduction programs in the future  including restructuring actions  to streamline our internal operations or as a result of changing economic conditions 
we derive a significant percentage of our revenues from sales to customers outside the united states 
international sales accounted for of our consolidated net revenues in  compared to and of our consolidated net revenues for and  respectively 
our international business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the customers 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates often materially affect  either positively or adversely  our revenues  net income and cash flow 
the percentage decreases in our international revenues were largely driven by divested or discontinued product lines  which had a high percentage of international sales  and the unfavorable impact on revenues of the changes in currency exchange rates 
see risk factors in item a of this annual report for risk factors that may cause our future results to differ materially from our current expectations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly reevaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the following revenue recognition and allowances for product returns and exchanges  stock based compensation  the valuation of business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets  and income tax assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and involve our most difficult and subjective estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition and allowances for product returns and exchanges we generally recognize revenues from sales of software and software related products upon receipt of a signed purchase order or contract and product shipment to distributors or end users  provided that collection is reasonably assured  the fee is fixed or determinable and all other revenue recognition criteria of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  subtopic  software revenue recognition  are met 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  we often receive multiple purchase orders or contracts from a single customer or a group of related parties that are evaluated to determine if they are  in effect  parts of a single arrangement 
if they are determined to be parts of a single arrangement  revenues are recorded as if a single multiple element arrangement exists 
in addition  for certain transactions where we consider our services to be non routine or essential to the delivered products  we record revenues upon satisfying the criteria of asc subtopic and obtaining customer acceptance 
we generally follow the guidance of asc subtopic for revenue recognition because our products and services are software or software related 
however  for certain offerings software is incidental to the delivered products and services 
for these products  we record revenues based on satisfying the criteria in asc subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
we generally use the residual method to recognize revenues when an order includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  assuming all other separation criteria are met  the fair values of the undelivered elements  typically professional services  maintenance or both  are deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenues related to the delivered element 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  we defer all revenues and only recognize them when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
fair value is typically based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately to customers 
however  for certain transactions  fair value of maintenance is based on the renewal price that is offered as a contractual right to the customer  provided that the renewal price is substantive 
our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type  purchase volume  term and customer location 
we review services revenues sold separately and corresponding renewal rates on a periodic basis and update  when appropriate  the fair value for services used for revenue recognition purposes to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether fair value exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 
in most cases  the products we sell do not require significant production  modification or customization of software 
installation of the products is generally routine  requires minimal effort and does not have to be performed by us 
however  certain transactions for our video products  typically complex solution sales that include a significant number of products and that may involve multiple customer sites  require us to perform an installation effort that we deem to be complex and non routine 
in these situations  we do not recognize revenues for either the products shipped or the services performed until the installation is complete 
in addition  if these orders include a customer acceptance provision  no revenues are recognized until the customer s formal acceptance of the products and services has been received 
technical support  enhancements and unspecified upgrades typically are provided at no additional charge during an initial warranty period generally between days and twelve months  which precedes commencement of any maintenance contracts 
we defer the fair value of this support and recognize the related revenues ratably over the initial warranty period 
we also from time to time offer certain customers free upgrades or specified future products or enhancements 
for each of these elements that is undelivered at the time of product shipment  and provided that we have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the undelivered element  we defer the fair value of the specified upgrade  product or enhancement and recognize those revenues only upon later delivery or at the time at which the remaining contractual terms relating to the upgrade have been satisfied 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from indirect sales channels  including authorized resellers and distributors 
certain channel partners are offered limited rights of return  stock rotation and price protection 
for these partners  we record a provision for estimated returns and other allowances as a reduction of revenues in the same period that related revenues are recorded in accordance with asc subtopic  revenue recognition products 
management estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing and maintaining a sales allowance for expected returns and other credits 
in making these estimates  we analyze historical returns and credits and the amounts of products held by major resellers and consider the impact of new product introductions  changes in customer demand  current economic conditions and other known factors 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
the amount and timing of our revenues for any period may be affected if actual product returns or other reseller credits prove to be materially different from our estimates 
a portion of our revenues from sales of consumer video editing and audio products is derived from transactions with channel partners who have unlimited return rights and from whom payment is contingent upon the product being sold through to their customers 
accordingly  revenues for these channel partners are recognized when the products are sold through to the customer instead of being recognized at the time products are shipped to the channel partners 
at the time of a sales transaction  we make an assessment of the collectibility of the amount due from the customer 
revenues are recognized only if it is probable that collection will occur in a timely manner 
in making this assessment  we consider customer credit worthiness and historical payment experience 
if it is determined from the outset of the arrangement that collection is not probable based on our credit review process  revenues are recognized on a cash collected basis to the extent that the other criteria of asc subtopic and sab are satisfied 
at the outset of the arrangement  we assess whether the fee associated with the order is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties 
in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable  we consider the payment terms of the transaction  our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions  and our involvement  if any  in third party financing transactions  among other factors 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenues are recognized only as payments become due from the customer  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if a significant portion of the fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are generally days  but can be up to days  after the invoice date  we evaluate whether we have sufficient history of successfully collecting past transactions with similar terms 
if that collection history is successful  revenues are recognized upon delivery of the products  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
if we were to change any of these assumptions and judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue reported in a particular period 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  an amendment to asc topic  revenue recognition  and asu no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  an amendment to asc subtopic  software revenue recognition the updates 
asu no 
requires the allocation of revenue  based on the relative selling price of each deliverable  to each unit of accounting for multiple element arrangements 
it also changes the level of evidence of standalone selling price required to separate deliverables by allowing a best estimate of the standalone selling price of deliverables when more objective evidence of fair value  such as vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence  is not available 
asu no 
amends subtopic to exclude sales of tangible products containing both software and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality from the scope of revenue recognition requirements for software arrangements 
the updates also include new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
the updates must be adopted in the same period using the same transition method and are effective prospectively  with retrospective adoption permitted  for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   or january  for us 
we will adopt the updates prospectively on january  and do not believe adoption will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation  which requires the application of a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
during  we granted both stock options and restricted stock units as part of our key performer stock based compensation program  as well as stock options and restricted stock units to newly hired employees 
in prior years  we have also issued restricted stock  and we refer to restricted stock and restricted stock units collectively as restricted stock awards 
the vesting of stock options and restricted stock awards may be based on time  performance  market conditions  or a combination of performance and market conditions 
in the future  we may grant stock awards  options  or other equity based instruments allowed by our stock based compensation plans  or a combination thereof  as part of our overall compensation strategy 
the fair values of restricted stock awards with time based vesting  including restricted stock and restricted stock units  are generally based on the intrinsic values of the awards at the date of grant 
as permitted under asc topic  we generally use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants 
the black scholes model relies on a number of key assumptions to calculate estimated fair values 
our assumed dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on recent six month trailing implied volatility calculations 
these calculations are performed on exchange traded options of our common stock based on the implied volatility of long term to month term exchange traded options 
we believe that using a forward looking market driven volatility assumption will result in the best estimate of expected volatility 
the assumed risk free interest rate is the us treasury security rate with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
the assumed expected life is based on company specific historical experience 
with regard to the estimate of the expected life  we consider the exercise behavior of past grants and model the pattern of aggregate exercises 
we also issue stock option grants or restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions  specifically avid s stock price  or a combination of performance  based on our return on equity  and market conditions 
the compensation costs and derived service periods for such grants are estimated using the monte carlo valuation method 
for stock option grants with vesting based on a combination of performance and market conditions  the compensation costs are also estimated using the black scholes valuation method factored for the estimated probability of achieving the performance goals  and compensation costs for these grants are recorded based on the higher estimate for each vesting tranche 
for restricted stock awards with vesting based on a combination of performance and market conditions  the compensation costs are also estimated based on the intrinsic values of the awards at the date of grant factored for the estimated probability of achieving the performance goals  and compensation costs for these grants are also recorded based on the higher estimate for each vesting tranche 
for each stock option grant and restricted stock award with vesting based on a combination of performance and market conditions where vesting will occur if either condition is met  the related compensation costs are recognized over the shorter of the derived service period or implicit service period 
we estimate forfeiture rates at the time awards are made based on historical and estimated future turnover rates and apply these rates in the calculation of estimated compensation cost 
the estimation of forfeiture rates includes a quarterly review of historical turnover rates and an update of the estimated forfeiture rates to be applied to employee classes for the calculation of stock based compensation 
for  forfeiture rates for the calculation of stock based compensation were estimated and applied based on three classes  non employee directors  executive management staff and other employees 
at december   our annualized estimated forfeiture rates were for non employee director awards and for both executive management staff and other employee awards 
then current estimated forfeiture rates are also applied quarterly to all outstanding stock options and non vested restricted stock awards  which may result in a revised estimate of compensation costs related to these stock based grants 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and earnings per share 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see notes b and o to our consolidated financial statements in item for further information regarding stock based compensation 
valuation of business combinations when we acquire new businesses  we allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets  including intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values  with any amount in excess of such allocations designated as goodwill 
significant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  particularly acquired intangible assets 
for example  it is necessary to estimate the portion of development efforts that are associated with technology that is in process and has no alternative future use 
the valuation of purchased intangible assets is based on estimates of the future performance and cash flows from the acquired business 
the use of different assumptions could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on at least an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or component thereof will be sold or otherwise disposed of  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  a reduction of our market capitalization relative to our net book value and other similar circumstances 
in accordance with asc subtopic  intangibles goodwill and others goodwill  we do not amortize goodwill 
the goodwill impairment test prescribed by asc requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair values of our reporting units at the date we test for impairment 
our organizational structure in was based on a single reporting unit 
in our annual goodwill impairment analysis  the fair value of our single reporting unit is compared to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we generally use a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine the fair value of our reporting unit 
this model focuses on estimates of future revenues and profits for our reporting unit and also assumes a terminal value for the unit based on a constant growth valuation formula 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
the model also includes assumptions for  among others  working capital cash flow  growth rates  income tax rates  expected tax benefits and long term discount rates  all of which require significant judgments by management 
we estimate the long term discount rate based on our review of the weighted average cost of capital and appropriate equity risk premium for our reporting unit 
we also consider the reconciliation of our market capitalization to the fair value of our reporting unit 
if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and its implied fair value 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment tests as of the end of the fourth quarter of each year 
our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
when events or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill may not be recoverable  we perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis 
the interim analysis includes calculating the fair value of the reporting unit being tested using a model similar to that used for the annual goodwill impairment testing 
the reporting unit s calculated fair value is then allocated among its tangible and intangible assets and liabilities to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the fair values of the intangible assets are estimated using various valuation models based on different approaches  such as the multi period excess cash flows approach  royalty savings approach and avoided cost approach 
these approaches include assumptions for  among others  customer retention rates  trademark royalty rates  costs to complete in process technology and long term discount rates  all of which require significant judgments by management 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and its implied fair value 
identifiable intangible assets are also tested for impairment in accordance with asc section  property  plant and equipment overall subsequent measurement  if events or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the fair value of each asset is compared to its carrying value  and if the asset s carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value 
the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
changes in business conditions or our assumptions could require that we record impairment charges related to our identifiable intangible assets 
assumptions  judgments and estimates of future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or forecasts 
although we believe our past assumptions  judgments and estimates used in calculating fair values for goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairment testing are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
income tax assets and liabilities we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes compared to the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability with consideration for such factors as historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
asc topic  income taxes  requires us to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
based on our level of deferred tax assets at december  and our level of historical us losses  we have determined that the uncertainty regarding the realization of these assets is sufficient to warrant the need for a full valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets 
we have also determined that a valuation allowance is warranted on a portion of our foreign deferred tax assets 
our assessment of the valuation allowance on our us and foreign deferred tax assets could change in the future based on our levels of pre tax income and other tax related adjustments 
reversal of the valuation allowance in whole or in part would result in a non cash reduction in income tax expense during the period of reversal 
to the extent some or all of our valuation allowance is reversed  future financial statements would reflect an increase in non cash income tax expense until such time as our deferred tax assets are fully utilized 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file 
we have taken and will continue to take tax positions based on our interpretation of such tax laws 
there can be no assurance that a taxing authority will not have a different interpretation of applicable law and assess us with additional taxes 
should we be assessed with additional taxes  it could have a negative impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
asc topic requires that a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained before being recognized in the financial statements 
it also requires the accrual of interest and penalties as applicable on our unrecognized tax positions 
at december  and  we had gross unrecognized tax benefits  including interest  of million and million  respectively  that  if recognized  would have resulted in a reduction of our effective tax rate 
results of operations net revenues net revenues for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands net revenues change compared to previous year net revenues change compared to previous year net revenues video products revenues audio products revenues products revenues services revenues total net revenues the increase in our total revenues for  compared to  included a increase in products revenues  partially offset by a decrease in services revenues 
the million increase in total revenues for  which was primarily the result of higher sales volumes for many of our product lines  included a million increase resulting from our acquisitions and a million decrease for the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates 
the decrease in our total revenues for  compared to  was driven by decreases in both products and services revenues 
the million decrease in our total revenues for included a million decrease related to divested or exited product lines 
the remaining decrease in our total revenues was primarily the result of lower sales volumes for many of our product lines 
sales to international customers accounted for of our consolidated net revenues in  compared to in and in the percentage decreases in our international revenues were largely driven by divested or discontinued product lines  which had a high percentage of international sales  and the unfavorable impact on revenues of the changes in currency exchange rates 
international sales increased by million  or  from to  compared to our worldwide increase in sales of 
international sales decreased by million  or  from to  compared to our worldwide decrease in sales of 
net revenues derived through indirect sales channels were approximately  and of our consolidated net revenues for  and  respectively 
the decreases in the percentage of revenues derived through indirect channels were largely driven by the divestiture of our pctv product lines and lower consumer editing product sales  both of which were primarily sold through indirect channels 
video products revenues the increase in revenues from our video products for  compared to  was primarily the result of increased revenues from sales of our isis shared storage systems and professional editors  as well as increased revenues from our interplay production and media asset management products and our broadcast newsroom product lines 
the increase in our isis shared storage revenues was driven by increases in both volume and average selling price  while the increased revenues for professional editors and interplay products were the result of increased volumes 
the release of a new version of media composer during the second quarter of was a significant factor in the increased professional editor volumes 
the increase for our broadcast newsroom product lines was driven by an increase in average selling price 
these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues from our consumer editor product lines on lower sales volumes  which was due to overall weakness in that market and our lack of new product introductions 
the increases in video product revenues for both periods were primarily in the americas and asia pacific regions  as our european revenues were impacted by unfavorable currency exchange rates 
the decrease in revenues from our video products for  compared to  was the result of a decrease of million related to divested or exited product lines and a decrease of million related to our continuing product lines 
the decrease for continuing product lines was the result of decreases in product revenues for all video products in all geographic regions largely due to lower sales volumes  which we believe was largely the result of unfavorable macroeconomic conditions 
throughout for example  broadcasters were challenged by decreasing advertising revenues  and capital expenditure budgets for many of our customers were reduced as a result of tight credit markets 
internationally  changes in currency exchange rates also contributed to the decrease in video product revenues 
audio products revenues the increase in revenues from our audio products for  compared to  included revenues of million related to our april acquisition of euphonix 
while this accounted for of the increase  revenues from our professional audio products and venue live sound product lines were higher in on increased sales volumes 
the increased volumes for our professional audio products was due to increased sales volumes resulting from sales promotions offered during the first six months of and the introduction of pro tools during the fourth quarter of the increase in audio product revenues was from all geographic regions despite the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates on our european revenues 
the decrease in audio product revenues for  compared to  was primarily due to lower revenues on lower volumes of our higher end audio product lines  which we believe largely resulted from decreased capital expenditure budgets for our customers in this market segment 
a proportionally larger decrease in audio product revenues in europe  which we believe were largely attributable to unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and changes in currency exchange rates  was also a significant contributing factor to the decrease in audio product revenues 
services revenues services revenues are derived primarily from maintenance contracts  as well as professional and integration services and training 
the decrease in services revenues for  compared to  was the result of decreases in maintenance and training revenues  partially offset by an increase in professional and integration services revenues  and included an increase of million resulting from our acquisitions 
the decrease in maintenance revenues was largely the result of declining renewal rates for previously discontinued product lines 
the decrease in services revenues for  compared to  was the result of a decrease of million related to divested or exited product lines and million for continuing product lines 
the decrease for continuing product lines was primarily due to a decrease in maintenance revenues  which was primarily the result of lower average maintenance contract values 
the decrease in maintenance revenues was partially offset by an increase in professional services revenues 
cost of revenues  gross profit and gross margin percentage cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the procurement of components  the assembly  testing and distribution of finished products  warehousing  customer support costs related to maintenance contract revenues and other services  royalties for third party software and hardware included in our products amortization of technology  and providing professional services and training 
amortization of technology represents the amortization of developed technology assets acquired as part of acquisitions and is described further in the amortization of intangible assets section below 
for and  cost of revenues also included restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  related to the write down of inventory resulting from our decision to exit the pctv product line 
costs of revenues for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands costs change compared to previous year costs change compared to previous year costs cost of products revenues cost of services revenues amortization of intangible assets restructuring costs total cost of revenues gross profit gross margin percentage gross margin percentage fluctuates based on factors such as the mix of products sold  the cost and proportion of third party hardware and software included in the systems sold  the offering of product upgrades  price discounts and other sales promotion programs  the distribution channels through which products are sold  the timing of new product introductions  sales of aftermarket hardware products such as disk drives  and currency exchange rate fluctuations 
gross margin for the years ended december   and gross margin increase decrease in gross margin gross margin increase in gross margin gross margin products services total increased products costs resulted in a slight decrease in product gross margin percentage in  compared to increased freight costs resulting from increased shipment volumes  including the increased use of more expensive air freight to support new product introductions and meet increased demand for certain products  was a significant factor in the increased product costs 
additionally  the unfavorable impact on revenues of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was also a factor in our product gross margin percentage decrease in decreased products costs resulting from our transition to a single company wide production and delivery organization and the divestiture of lower margin product lines  were the most significant contributing factors to our improved product gross margin percentage for  compared to in addition  a revised estimate for a royalty accrual  resulting in a favorable adjustment in  also contributed to the improvement 
these improvements were partially offset by the unfavorable impact on revenues of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the increase in services gross margin percentage for  compared to  primarily resulted from improved utilization of services resources

the increase in personnel related costs  which include travel and entertainment costs  was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits costs  including salaries and benefits costs for programs reinstated in that were suspended during much of  and the expenses added by our acquisitions 
also during  net foreign exchange losses specifically  foreign exchange transaction and remeasurement gains and losses on net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies  offset by non designated foreign currency hedging gains and losses  which are included in marketing and selling expenses  were million  compared to gains of million for  resulting in a million decrease in the offset to expense

amortization of intangible assets intangible assets result from acquisitions and include developed technology  customer related intangibles  trade names and other identifiable intangible assets with finite lives 
with the exception of developed technology  these intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method 
developed technology is amortized over the greater of the amount calculated using the ratio of current quarter revenues to the total of current quarter and anticipated future revenues over the estimated useful life of the developed technology  and the straight line method over each developed technology s remaining useful life 
amortization of developed technology is recorded within cost of revenues 
amortization of customer related intangibles  trade names and other identifiable intangible assets is recorded within operating expenses 
amortization of intangible assets for and compared to the prior year dollars in thousands increase decrease from decrease increase from amortization of intangible assets recorded in cost of revenues amortization of intangible assets recorded in operating expenses total amortization of intangible assets the increase in amortization of intangible assets recorded in cost of revenues during  compared to  was primarily the result of the amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions of blue order and euphonix and the acquisition of maxt systems inc in the third quarter of the decrease in amortization of intangible assets recorded in operating expenses for the same period was the result of the completion of the amortization of certain intangible assets acquired as part of prior acquisitions  partially offset by amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions of blue order  euphonix and maxt 
the decrease in amortization of intangible assets recorded in cost of revenues during  compared to  was primarily the result of the completion during and early of the amortization of certain developed technologies related to our past acquisitions of pinnacle  sundance and m audio  partially offset by amortization resulting from the acquisition of maxt 
the decrease in amortization recorded in operating expenses for the same period was primarily the result of the impairments of intangible assets recorded in the unamortized balance of the identifiable intangible assets related to all acquisitions was million at december  we expect amortization of these intangible assets to be approximately million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and million thereafter

impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each year in accordance with asc subtopic our annual goodwill analysis performed in the fourth quarter of determined that the fair value of our single reporting unit  based on a discounted cash flow valuation  exceeded its carrying value  indicating there was no goodwill impairment 
goodwill is also tested for impairment when events and circumstances occur that indicate that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
in september  as a result of a decrease in market value for  and the expected sale of  our pctv product line  which had historically accounted for a significant portion of former consumer video reporting unit revenues  we performed an interim impairment test on the goodwill assigned to our former consumer video reporting unit 
because the book value of the former consumer video goodwill exceeded the implied fair value by million  we recorded this amount as an impairment loss during the quarter ended september  in connection with the goodwill impairment loss taken for the former consumer video reporting unit in the third quarter of  we also tested the former consumer video reporting unit s identifiable intangible assets for impairment 
as a result  we determined that the trade name intangible asset was impaired  and we recorded an impairment loss of million to write this asset down to its then current fair value 
in the fourth quarter of due to the significant decline in our stock price  increased uncertainty of future revenue levels due to unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and the divestiture of our pctv product line  our annual goodwill testing determined that the carrying values of the former audio and former consumer video reporting units exceeded their fair values  indicating possible goodwill impairments for these reporting units 
the fair values of these reporting units were then allocated among their respective tangible and intangible assets and liabilities to determine the implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill 
because the book values of the former audio and former consumer video goodwill exceeded their implied fair values by approximately million and million  respectively  we recorded these amounts as impairment losses during the quarter ended december  in connection with the goodwill impairment loss taken for the former audio and former consumer video reporting units in the fourth quarter of  we also reviewed the audio and consumer video identifiable intangible assets for possible impairment 
this analysis included grouping the intangible assets with other operating assets and liabilities of the former consumer video reporting unit that would not otherwise be subject to impairment testing because the grouped assets and liabilities represent the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities within our company 
the result of this analysis determined that the former consumer video reporting unit customer relationships and trade name intangible assets were impaired  and we recorded impairment losses of million and million  respectively  to write these assets down to their then current fair values 
the analysis for the former audio reporting unit determined that no impairment existed for that reporting unit s identifiable intangible assets

restructuring and other costs  net restructuring plans in december  we initiated a company wide restructuring plan designed to better align financial and human resources in accordance with our strategic plans for the upcoming fiscal year 
in connection with the restructuring  we eliminated positions that were in lower growth geographies and markets and will reinvest in more strategic areas with greater opportunity for growth 
the plan also calls for the streamlining of internal operations while making key investments in organizational efficiencies and closing portions of certain office facilities 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to severance costs related to the elimination of positions and million related to the partial closure of a facility 
we expect to incur total restructuring charges of approximately million related to this plan  all of which represent cash expenditures 
we expect to complete the actions under this plan during the first half of during  we also recorded acquisition related restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  primarily for severance costs for approximately former euphonix employees and the closure of three euphonix facilities 
additionally  during  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to a restructuring plan  as discussed below  and a million reduction for revised estimated obligations related to facilities closed under restructuring actions taken prior to also included in our results of operations under the caption restructuring and other costs  net for  were costs of million related to our exit from our former headquarters lease 
restructuring plans in october  we initiated a company wide restructuring plan that included a reduction in force of approximately positions  including employees related to our product line divestitures  and the closure of all or parts of some of our worldwide facilities 
the restructuring plan was intended to improve operational efficiencies and bring our costs in line with expected revenues 
in connection with the plan  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to employee termination costs and million for the closure of three small facilities 
in addition  as a result of the decision to sell the pctv product line  we recorded a non cash restructuring charge of million in cost of revenues related to the write down of inventory 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of million  consisting of charges of million related to the plan initiated in and a reduction of million resulting from revised estimates for amounts recorded under previous restructuring plans 
charges under the plan included new restructuring charges of million and revisions to previously recorded estimates under the plan of million 
the new restructuring charges included million related to employee termination costs  including those for approximately additional employees  million related to the closure of all or part of eleven facilities  and million  recorded in cost of revenues  related to the write down of pctv inventory 
the charges resulting from the reduction in force of additional employees were recorded in the third and fourth quarters and were primarily the result of the expanded use of offshore development resources for r d projects and our desire to better align our cost structure with revenue expectations 
during  we recorded restructuring charges under the plan totaling million  consisting of new charges of million as a result of the closure of all or part of four additional facilities  charges of million for revised estimates of facilities costs  and a reduction of million for revised estimates of severance obligations previously recorded under this plan 
during the first nine months of  we initiated restructuring plans within our former professional video business unit as well as corporate operations to eliminate duplicative business functions and improve operational efficiencies 
in connection with these actions  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to employee termination costs for approximately employees  primarily in the research and development  marketing and selling  and general and administrative teams 
also during  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million for revised estimates of previously initiated restructuring plans 
gain on sales of assets in the fourth quarter of  we sold our softimage d animation product line  which was part of our former professional video segment  and our pctv product line  which was part of our former consumer video segment 
the softimage d animation product line was sold to autodesk  inc  and million of the million dollar purchase price was received in the fourth quarter of  with the remaining balance held in escrow with scheduled distribution dates in and during  we recognized a gain of approximately million as a result of this transaction  which does not include the proceeds held in escrow 
during and  we recorded further gains of million in each year as a result of the release of the funds from escrow in accordance with the terms of the purchase and sale agreement 
the pctv product line was sold to hauppauge digital  inc for total proceeds of approximately million  which included million in cash and a note valued at million 
during  we recognized a gain of approximately million as a result of this transaction 
pctv inventory valued at million was classified as held for sale within other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet at december  under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  we are reimbursed for the cost of pctv inventory sold by the buyer 
during  the buyer s sell through of inventory classified as held for sale was lower than anticipated  and  as a result  we recorded a loss on the sale of assets of million related to our sale of the pctv product line 
during  we recorded a gain on the sale of assets of million related to the sale of the remaining inventory classified as held for sale 
during  the sale of certain intangible assets for million was also recorded as a gain on sales of assets 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  generally consists of interest income and interest expense 
interest and other income expense for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands income expense change compared to previous year income expense change compared to previous year income expense interest income interest expense other income expense  net total interest and other income expense  net the change in interest and other income expense  net for both and  compared to the previous years  was primarily the result of lower interest rates paid on lower average cash balances 
as a result of our revolving credit facilities  we expect our interest expense to increase starting in the magnitude of the increase will depend on the level of our borrowings 
provision for benefit from income taxes  net provision for benefit from income taxes  net for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands provision change compared to previous year benefit change compared to previous year provision provision for benefit from income taxes  net the net tax provision of million for reflected a current tax provision of million and a deferred tax benefit of million mostly related to the foreign amortization of non deductible acquisition related intangible assets and the release of valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
the net tax benefit of million for reflected a current tax benefit of million and a deferred tax benefit of million mostly related to the foreign amortization of non deductible acquisition related intangible assets and the release of a valuation allowance on a portion of the deferred tax assets in our canadian entity 
the net tax provision of million for reflected a current tax provision of million and a deferred tax benefit of million mostly related to the foreign amortization of non deductible acquisition related intangible assets  as well as the write down of deferred tax liabilities due to goodwill and intangible asset impairments 
our effective tax rate  which represents our tax provision benefit as a percentage of profit or loss before tax  was  and  respectively  for  and our provision for benefit from income taxes and effective tax rate both changed from net benefits in to net provisions in these changes were the result of significant favorable discrete tax benefits in that exceeded the favorable discrete tax benefits in  partially offset by a reduction in tax in from refinements in the way profit gets allocated among legal entities 
the change from a tax provision in to a tax benefit in was the result of discrete tax benefits of million primarily related to the completion of a foreign tax audit  million for cumulative adjustments of prior year provisions to actual tax return filings and million from the utilization of unused r d tax credits  all occurring in we generally recognize no significant us tax benefit from acquisition related amortization 
the tax rate in each year is affected by net changes in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
excluding the impact of the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate would have been  and  respectively  for the years  and these rates differ from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the mix of income and losses in foreign jurisdictions  which have tax rates that differ from the statutory rate  non deductible impairment of goodwill expenses  and non deductible acquisition related expenses 
we file in multiple tax jurisdictions and from time to time are subject to audit in certain tax jurisdictions  but we believe that we are adequately reserved for these exposures 
see note q to our consolidated financial statements in item for further information on our unrecognized tax benefits at december  and liquidity and capital resources liquidity and sources of cash we have generally funded our operations in recent years through the use of existing cash balances as well as from the proceeds of the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans 
at december  and  our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million and million  respectively 
on october   avid technology  inc  or avid technology  and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo capital finance llc  or wells fargo 
pursuant to the credit agreement  wells fargo agreed to provide revolving credit facilities up to a maximum of million in domestic borrowings and up to a maximum of an additional million for our avid technology international bv  or avid europe  subsidiary 
the borrowing availability under the credit facilities is based on the lesser of the foregoing commitments for avid technology and avid europe  as applicable  and a borrowing base which is a percentage of accounts receivable and inventory of avid technology or that of avid europe  as applicable 
the actual amounts available to borrow will vary depending upon changes in the level of their respective accounts receivable and inventory  and is subject to other terms and conditions which are more specifically described in the credit agreement 
the borrowing availability is also subject to other reserve requirements which may be established by wells fargo as provided in the credit agreement 
the credit facilities have a maturity of four years  at which time wells fargo s commitments to provide additional credit shall be terminated and all outstanding borrowings must be repaid 
prior to the maturity of the credit facilities  any amounts borrowed may be repaid and  subject to the terms and conditions of the credit agreement  reborrowed in whole or in part without penalty 
the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties  covenants  mandatory prepayments  and events of default under which the payment obligations of avid technology and avid europe may be accelerated 
interest accrues on outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities at a rate of either libor plus or a base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus  at our option 
we must also pay wells fargo a monthly unused line fee at a rate of per annum on an amount equal to the average lending commitments under the credit facilities during the immediately preceding month less the average daily amount of the outstanding borrowings plus the undrawn amount of any outstanding letters of credit under the credit facilities during the immediately preceding month 
during the term of the credit facilities  we are entitled to reduce the maximum amounts of wells fargo s commitments  subject to the payment of certain fees based on the amount of any reduction 
we have provided guarantees and liens on substantially all of our assets and those of certain of our subsidiaries to secure our obligations under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement requires that avid technology maintain liquidity comprised of unused availability under the domestic portion of the credit facilities plus certain unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million  at least million of which must be from unused availability under the domestic portion of the credit facilities 
avid europe is required to maintain liquidity comprised of unused availability under avid europe s portion of the credit facilities plus certain unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million  at least million of which must be from unused availability under avid europe s portion of the credit facilities 
we expect to borrow against the line from time to time to cover short term cash requirements in certain geographies or to otherwise meet the funding needs of the business 
during the fourth quarter of  our us operations borrowed million against the credit facilities to meet certain short term cash requirements 
all amounts borrowed were repaid during the quarter  and at december   we had no outstanding borrowings against the line 
at december   we had available borrowings of approximately million and million under the avid technology and avid europe credit facilities  respectively 
subsequent to december   the date of these financial statements  our us operations borrowed million against the credit facilities to meet short term cash requirements 
none of the amounts borrowed had been repaid as of the filing date of this annual report 
our cash requirements vary depending on factors such as the growth of our business  changes in working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions of businesses or technologies and obligations under restructuring programs 
we believe that we have sufficient cash  cash equivalents  funds generated from operations and funds available under the credit facilities to meet our operational and strategic objectives for at least the next twelve months 
the following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  net cash used in provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities primarily reflected changes in working capital items  in particular increases in inventories and accounts receivable  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 
these changes were also partially offset by the positive impact of our net loss after adjustment for non cash items  in particular depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities primarily reflected our net loss adjusted for depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense  as well as changes in working capital items  in particular decreases in deferred revenues and accrued liabilities  partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventory 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflected our net loss adjusted for depreciation and amortization  goodwill and intangible asset impairment losses  stock based compensation expense  and the gain on the sale of our softimage d animation and pctv product lines  as well as changes in working capital items  in particular decreases in accounts receivable and inventories and an increase in accrued expenses 
accounts receivable increased by million to million at december  from million at december  these balances are net of allowances for sales returns  bad debts and customer rebates  all of which we estimate and record based primarily on historical experience 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable  or dso  was days at december   compared to days at december  our accounts receivable aging at december  has improved slightly from the december  aging  and we believe the dso of days is the result of the timing of revenue recognition and customer receipts 
inventories increased by million to million at december  from million at december  these balances included stockroom  spares and demonstration equipment inventories at various locations  as well as inventory at customer sites related to shipments for which we had not yet recognized revenue 
the increase in inventories at december  was primarily the result of increased stocking levels to meet increased demand  as well as a buildup of inventory related to new product introductions 
during much of  we experienced certain supply chain issues that impacted our ability to meet the demand for certain of our products 
at our current inventory levels  we believe we have improved our ability to meet product demand in at december   compared to december   we reported decreases in raw materials and work in process  offset by an increase in finished goods  related to our increased use of contractors to manufacture our products  components and subassemblies 
we review all inventory balances regularly for excess quantities or potential obsolescence and make appropriate adjustments as needed to write down the inventories to reflect their estimated realizable value 
we source inventory products and components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time 
accounts payable increased by million to million at december  from million at december  this increase in accounts payable is primarily the result of the timing of cash payments to our vendors 
accrued liabilities increased by million to million at december  from million at december  our accrued liabilities include obligations incurred in connection with restructuring activities during and prior periods 
at december   we had restructuring accruals of million and million related to severance and lease obligations  respectively 
our future cash obligations for leases for which we have vacated the underlying facilities total approximately million 
the lease accruals represent the present value of the excess of our lease commitments on the vacated space over expected payments to be received on subleases of the relevant facilities 
the lease payments will be made over the remaining terms of the leases  which have varying expiration dates through  unless we are able to negotiate earlier terminations 
the severance payments will be made during the next twelve months 
cash payments resulting from restructuring obligations totaled approximately million during all payments related to restructuring actions are expected to be funded through working capital 
see note r to our consolidated financial statements in item for the activity in the restructuring and other costs accrual for cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december   the net cash flow used in investing activities primarily reflected million used for the purchase of property and equipment and million paid to acquire blue order and euphonix  partially offset by net proceeds of million resulting from the timing of the sale and purchase of marketable securities and the release of escrow holdings totaling million related to the sale of our softimage d animation product line 
for the year ended december   the net cash flow used in investing activities primarily reflected million used for the purchase of property and equipment  a million facility related escrow deposit into a long term asset account and million paid for our acquisition of maxt  partially offset by net proceeds of million resulting from the timing of the sale and purchase of marketable securities and the release of escrow holdings totaling million also related to the sale of our softimage d animation product line 
the million facility related escrow deposit in was related to our leases for new headquarters facilities in burlington  massachusetts 
for the year ended december   the net cash flow used in investing activities primarily reflected million for the purchase of property and equipment and net purchases of million resulting from the timing of the sale and purchase of marketable securities  partially offset by proceeds  net of transaction costs  of million from the sale of our softimage d animation and pctv product lines 
our purchases of property and equipment typically consist of computer hardware and software to support our r d activities and information systems 
the increase in property and equipment purchases in the period primarily resulted from leasehold improvement  furniture and equipment costs associated with the relocation of our corporate offices to burlington  massachusetts in june during  leasehold improvements furniture and equipment related to this relocation were placed in service and resulted in fixed asset additions of approximately million  of which million represented cash expenditures during the period 
during the same period  we wrote off fixed assets with gross book values and net book values of approximately million and million  respectively  that were related to the closure of our former headquarters facility 
cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december   the net cash flow used in financing activities primarily reflected the issuance costs for our revolving credit facilities and costs associated with tax withholding obligations resulting from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans  partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 
also during  our us operations borrowed and repaid million against our revolving credit facilities to meet certain short term cash requirements 
for the year ended december   the net cash flow provided by financing activities in reflected proceeds from the issuance of stock related to the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by costs associated with tax withholding obligations resulting from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and million used to repurchase stock options during the second quarter of for the year ended december   the net cash flow used in financing activities was the result of million used for a stock repurchase program  slightly offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
during and  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock through transactions on the open market  in block trades or otherwise 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for a total purchase price  including commissions  of million 
no shares of our common stock were repurchased under this program in or the stock repurchase program is being funded through working capital and has no expiration date and has a remaining balance of million authorized for future repurchases 
fair value measurements we value our cash and investment instruments using quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
see note e to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for disclosure of the fair values and the inputs used to determine the fair values of our financial assets and financial liabilities 
contractual and commercial obligations the following table sets forth future payments that we were obligated to make at december  under existing lease agreements and commitments to purchase inventory in thousands total less than year years years after years operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other contractual arrangements or unrecognized tax positions that may result in cash payments consisted of the following at december  in thousands total a less than year years years after years transactions with recourse unrecognized tax positions and related interest stand by letters of credit a at december   liability related to unrecognized tax positions and related interest was million  and we were unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the liability in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of the positions 
our transactions with recourse are related to lease financing options  which we have historically offered to our customers through a third party lessor 
this program was terminated by mutual agreement among the parties in late  however  balances outstanding as of the termination date continue to be collected by the third party lessors as they become due 
during the terms of these financing arrangements  which were generally for three years  we may remain liable for a portion of the unpaid principal balance in the event of a default on the lease by the end user  but our liability is limited in the aggregate based on a percentage of initial amounts funded or  in certain cases  amounts of unpaid balances 
at december   our maximum exposure under these programs was approximately million 
we have three letters of credit at a bank that are used as security deposits in connection with our leased burlington  massachusetts headquarters office space 
in the event of default on the underlying leases  the landlords would  at december   be eligible to draw against the letters of credit to a maximum of approximately million in the aggregate 
the letters of credit are subject to aggregate reductions of approximately million at the end of each of the second  third and fifth years  provided that we are not in default of the underlying leases and meet certain financial performance conditions 
in no case will the letters of credit amounts be reduced to below million in the aggregate throughout the lease periods  all of which extend to may at december   we were not in default of any of the underlying leases 
we also have a stand by letter of credit at a bank that is used as a security deposit in connection with our daly city  california office space lease 
in the event of a default on this lease  the landlord would be eligible to draw against this letter of credit to a maximum  at december   of million 
the letter of credit will remain in effect at this amount throughout the remaining lease period  which runs through september at december   we were not in default of this lease 
we operate our business globally and  consequently  our results from operations are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into forward exchange contracts  which generally have one month maturities  to reduce exposures associated with the foreign exchange risks of certain forecasted third party and intercompany receivables  payables and cash balances 
at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional value of million  denominated in the euro  british pound  japanese yen  canadian dollar  singapore dollar and danish kroner  as a hedge against forecasted foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances 
off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements or have any variable interest entities 
at december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we have significant international operations and  therefore  our revenues  earnings  cash flows and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables  payables  sales transactions and net investments in foreign operations 
we derive more than half of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
this business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the end user customers 
therefore  we are exposed to the risks that changes in foreign currency could adversely affect our revenues  net income and cash flow 
we use derivatives in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to manage our short term exposures to fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates that exist as part of our ongoing international business operations 
we do not enter into any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the success of our hedging programs depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies and contract rates versus financial statement rates 
to the extent these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
as required by fasb asc topic  derivatives and hedging  we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative  whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting  and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting 
derivatives designated and qualifying as hedges of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges 
derivatives designated and qualifying as hedges of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation 
hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge 
we may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risks  even though we elect not to apply hedge accounting under fasb asc topic during  we executed foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign exchange currency risk associated with certain forecasted euro denominated sales transactions 
these contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under the criteria of fasb asc topic the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity and subsequently reclassified into revenues at the time the hedged transactions affect earnings 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recognized directly into earnings 
to date  no amounts have been recorded as a result of hedging ineffectiveness 
at december   we did not have foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as a hedge against forecasted euro denominated sales transactions 
for the year ended december   net losses of million resulting from such forward contracts were included in our revenues 
as a hedge against the foreign exchange exposure of certain forecasted receivables  payables and cash balances  we enter into short term foreign currency forward contracts 
there are two objectives of this foreign currency forward contract program to offset any foreign exchange currency risk associated with cash receipts expected to be received from our customers and cash payments expected to be made to our vendors over the next day period and to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange on our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity 
these forward contracts typically mature within days of execution 
we record gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on these contracts in results of operations  offsetting gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional value of million  denominated in the euro  british pound  japanese yen  canadian dollar  singapore dollar and danish kroner  as a hedge against actual and forecasted foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances 
the mark to market effect associated with foreign currency forward contracts was a net unrealized gain of million at december  for the year ended december   net gains of million resulting from forward contracts and million of net transaction and remeasurement losses on the related assets and liabilities were included in our marketing and selling expenses 
as it relates to our use of foreign currency forward contracts  a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows  assuming the above mentioned forecasts of foreign currency exposure are accurate  because the impact on the forward contracts as a result of a change would at least partially offset the impact on the revenues and asset and liability positions of our foreign subsidiaries 
interest rate risk at december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents
