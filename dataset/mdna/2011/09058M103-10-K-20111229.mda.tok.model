business overview we are an international contract research organization providing drug discovery and development services 
our clients and partners include pharmaceutical  biotechnology  academic and governmental organizations 
we apply innovative technologies and products and a commitment to quality to help clients and partners accelerate the development of safe and effective therapeutics and maximize the returns on their research and development investments 
we offer an efficient  variable cost alternative to our clients internal product development programs 
outsourcing development work to reduce overhead and speed drug approvals through the food and drug administration fda is an established alternative to in house development among pharmaceutical companies 
we derive our revenues from sales of our research services and drug development tools  both of which are focused on determining drug safety and efficacy 
the company has been involved in the research of drugs to treat numerous therapeutic areas for over years 
we support the preclinical and clinical development needs of researchers and clinicians for small molecule and large biomolecule drug candidates 
we believe our scientists have the skills in analytical instrumentation development  chemistry  computer software development  physiology  medicine  analytical chemistry and toxicology to make the services and products we provide increasingly valuable to our current and potential clients 
our principal clients are scientists engaged in analytical chemistry  drug safety evaluation  clinical trials  drug metabolism studies  pharmacokinetics and basic research at many of the small start up biotechnology companies and the largest global pharmaceutical companies 
our business is largely dependent on the level of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies efforts in new drug discovery and approval 
our services segment is a direct beneficiary of these efforts  through outsourcing by these companies of research work 
our products segment is an indirect beneficiary of these efforts  as increased drug development leads to capital expansion  providing opportunities to sell the equipment we produce and the consumable supplies we provide that support our products 
research services are capital intensive 
the investment in equipment and facilities to serve our markets is substantial and continuing 
while our physical facilities are adequate to meet market needs for the near term  rapid changes in automation  precision  speed and technologies necessitate a constant investment in equipment and software to meet market demands 
we are also impacted by the heightened regulatory environment and the need to improve our business infrastructure to support our increasingly diverse operations  which will necessitate additional capital investment 
our ability to generate capital to reinvest in our capabilities  both through operations and financial transactions  is critical to our success 
while we are currently committed to fully utilizing recent additions to capacity  sustained growth will require additional investment in future periods 
our financial position could limit our ability to make such investments 
executive overview our revenues are dependent on a relatively small number of industries and clients 
as a result  we closely monitor the market for our services 
for a discussion of the trends affecting the market for our services  see item business trends affecting the drug discovery and development industry 
in fiscal  we experienced increased demand for our products and services as compared to fiscal we believe in the fundamentals of the market and that it will continue to slowly rebound in future periods 
for fiscal  we plan to focus on sales execution  operational excellence and building strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  to differentiate our company and create value for our clients and shareholders 
we review various metrics to evaluate our financial performance  including period to period changes in new orders  revenue  margins and earnings 
in fiscal  we had new authorizations of million  a small decrease of over the same period in fiscal mainly due to pricing declines 
combined with the new authorizations in fiscal and similar total in fiscal  our revenues in fiscal increased over versus fiscal gross margin increased and operating expenses declined from the prior fiscal year due to cost containment measures and operational efficiencies 
as a result  we reported net income for fiscal of versus a net loss of  in fiscal fiscal represents our first year of net income since fiscal we will continue initiatives to control costs and improve productivity to achieve our fiscal financial objectives 
for a detailed discussion of our revenue  margins  earnings and other financial results for the fiscal year ended september   see results of operations compared to below 
as of september   we had  of cash and cash equivalents as compared to  of cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal in fiscal  we generated  in cash from operations primarily from the net income we achieved versus a net loss in fiscal during fiscal  we also paid down our long term debt by an additional  and accounts payable by likewise in the current fiscal year  we successfully closed our registered public equity offering  which netted cash of million 
we believe that the development of innovative new drugs is going through an evolution  evidenced by the significant reduction of expenditures on research and development at several major international pharmaceutical companies  accompanied by increases in outsourcing and investments in smaller start up companies that are performing the early development work on new compounds 
many of these companies are funded by either venture capital or pharmaceutical investment  or both  and generally do not build internal staffs that possess the extensive scientific and regulatory capabilities to perform the various activities necessary to progress a drug candidate to the filing of an investigative new drug ind application with the fda 
while continuing to maintain and develop our relationships with large pharmaceutical companies  we intend to aggressively promote our services to developing businesses  which will require us to expand our existing capabilities to provide services early in the drug development process  and to consult with clients on regulatory strategy and compliance leading to their fda filings 
we have recently launched our enhanced drug discovery services as part of this strategy  utilizing our proprietary culex technology to provide early experiments in our laboratories that previously would have been conducted in the sponsor s facilities 
as we move forward  we must balance the demands of the large pharmaceutical companies with the personal touch needed by smaller biotechnology companies to develop a competitive advantage 
we intend to accomplish this through the use of and expanding upon our existing project management skills  strategic partnerships and progressive relationship management 
net income loss attributable to common shareholders and net income loss per share net loss attributable to common shareholders was  and  for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
the diluted net loss per share was for the fiscal year ended september  compared to diluted net loss per share of for the fiscal year ended september  the net loss available to common shareholders and diluted net loss per share in fiscal was impacted by dividends on the series a preferred shares issued on may  of  and as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the net income available to common shareholders would have been for the fiscal year ended september   exclusive of the preferred dividends 
the diluted net income per share exclusive of the preferred dividends was for the fiscal year ended september  we consider the income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per share exclusive of the dividends to be a useful measure in comparing operating results of the company because the preferred dividends are considered nonrecurring items since they are associated with this offering only 
the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding include the dilutive effects of the series a preferred shares  warrants and stock options 
we compute diluted earnings per share using the if converted method for preferred stock and the treasury stock method for stock options and warrants 
the following table reconciles gaap net income loss per share to the net income loss per share exclusive of the preferred dividends 
the following table reconciles gaap net income loss per share to the adjusted net income loss per share

the purpose of the legislation is to extend medical insurance coverage to a higher percentage of us citizens 
many of the provisions in the act have delayed effective dates over the next decade  and will require extensive regulatory guidance 
companies in our principal client industry  pharmaceuticals  will be required under the act to provide additional discounts on medicines provided under medicare and medicaid to assist in the funding of the program  however  government estimates are that over million additional citizens will eventually be covered by medical insurance as a result of the act  which should expand the markets for their products 
it is premature to accurately predict the impacts these and other competing forces will have on our basic client market  drug development 
additionally  the act does not directly impact spiraling health care costs in the us  which could lead to additional legislation impacting our target markets in the future 
we maintain an optional health benefits package for all of our full time employees  which is largely paid by our contributions with employees paying a portion of the cost  generally less than of the total 
based on our current understanding of the act  we do not anticipate significant changes to our programs or of their costs to the company or our employees as a result of the act 
we have experienced increases in the costs of our health benefit programs in excess of inflation rates  and expect those trends to continue 
we are exploring options in plan funding  delivery of benefits and employee wellness in our continuing effort to obtain maximum benefit for our health care expenditures  while maintaining quality programs for our employees 
we do not expect these efforts to have a material financial impact on the company 
results of operations the following table summarizes the consolidated statement of operations as a percentage of total revenues year ended september  service revenue product revenue total revenue cost of service revenue a cost of product revenue a total cost of revenue gross profit total operating expenses operating income loss other expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss a percentage of service and product revenues  respectively 
compared to service and product revenues revenues for the year ended september  increased to  compared to  for the year ended september  our services revenue increased to  compared to  for the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of increases in each of the revenue groups of bioanalytical analysis  toxicology  and other laboratory services 
increases in these groups from the same period in fiscal are mainly due to increases in new bookings and volumes of studies as well as number of samples to assay  even though pricing still lags pre recession levels 
we have also recently launched our enhanced drug discovery services which have contributed to the revenue increase 
the following table shows more detail for our service revenue 
fiscal year ended september  change bioanalytical analysis toxicology other laboratory services sales in our products segment increased from  to  when compared to the prior fiscal year 
the majority of the increase stems from higher sales of our culex automated in vivo sampling system over prior fiscal year as customers began to release capital funds for larger projects 
other instruments revenue was negatively impacted in fiscal as a grant funded by the nih expired in january the following table shows more detail for our product revenue 
fiscal year ended september  change culex  in vivo sampling systems analytical instruments other instruments cost of revenue cost of revenue for the year ended september  was  or of revenue compared to  or of revenue for the comparable prior period 
cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased to in the current fiscal year from in the prior year 
the principal cause of this decrease was the increase in revenues which led to higher absorption of the fixed costs in our service segment as well as other cost containment measures 
a significant portion of our costs of productive capacity in the service segment are fixed 
thus  increases in revenues lead to decreases in costs as a percentage of revenue 
cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue in the current fiscal year decreased to from in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease is mainly due to expense reductions and a reduction in the cost of obsolete and slow moving inventory in the current fiscal year compared to the cost recognized in the prior fiscal year 
operating expenses selling expenses for the year ended september  increased by to  from  for the year ended september  this increase was primarily driven by an increase in salaries and higher spending for marketing expenditures and consulting services as we implement our new sales and marketing strategy 
research and development expenses for the year ended september  decreased to from for the year ended september  the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in spending on temporary labor as we completed a project funded by an nih grant in fiscal general and administrative expenses for the current fiscal year decreased to  from  for the prior year 
the decrease is mainly due to the following severance expenses for former employees recorded in the first quarter of fiscal from the reduction in force  a retirement payment accrual for our former ceo in the prior year  lease settlement costs in fiscal  and company wide efforts at cost containment 
other income expense other income expense  net  was for the year ended september  as compared to  for the year ended september  the primary reasons for the decrease are lower mortgage interest in fiscal as a result of the two separate principal payments made in fiscal  as well as lower lease interest resulting from maturing leases 
plus  in fiscal  we incurred additional costs for our new line of credit agreement  income taxes our effective tax rate for the year ended september  was compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the current year expense primarily relates to cash tax expense for us corporate alternative minimum tax 
the benefit in fiscal is the result of resolving an uncertain state tax liability for less than the recorded amount 
no net benefits have been provided on taxable losses in the current fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources comparative cash flow analysis at september   we had cash and cash equivalents of  compared to  at september  net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended september   compared to  for the year ended september  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the current fiscal year mainly results from a decrease in customer advances from the prior fiscal year 
other contributing factors to our cash from operations were  of depreciation and amortization and stock option expense of included in operating activities for fiscal are non cash charges of  for depreciation and amortization  net collections on accounts receivable of  an increase in customer advances of  as we booked new business and the recording of a long term liability in settlement of a contingent lease liability on our former baltimore facility 
the impact on operating cash flow of other changes in working capital was not material 
in january  we completed a reduction in work force  through both attrition and terminations  which impacted all areas of operations and reduced our annual compensation expense by approximately and impacted our cash flow from operations in fiscal as well 
we have seen increased order activity in the calendar year as well as the first nine months of calendar  which we expect will translate into earned revenues in fiscal due to the long term nature of some of our contracts 
operating expenses declined approximately in fiscal from the prior year period from continued cost containment initiatives even as we absorbed increased expenses for our new sales and marketing team and strategy 
we expect to experience selective cost increases in fiscal as we invest in personnel and technologies for our future growth 
investing activities used  in fiscal for capital expenditures 
our principal investments were for new laboratory equipment  replacements and upgrades in all of our facilities as well as general building and information technology infrastructure expenditures at all sites 
the increase in capital spending from fiscal is a result of the availability of financing from our improved financial performance in the current fiscal year 
we intend to spend a similar amount for capital expenditures  particularly for laboratory equipment  in our next fiscal year when financing becomes available to fund our purchases 
financing activities provided  in the current fiscal year as compared to  used for fiscal the main source of cash in fiscal was the completion of our may equity offering  which netted  as well as net borrowings on our line of credit of  offset by long term debt and capital lease payments of  including the two individual principal payments on one mortgage and one note payable and the down payments of for the new capital leases for laboratory equipment 
in fiscal  we had long term debt and capital lease payments of  as well as net payments on our line of credit of also in fiscal  we conducted a sale and leaseback of some of our unencumbered laboratory equipment which netted us of cash 
capital resources property and equipment spending totaled  and in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in spending in fiscal is the result of new laboratory equipment financed mainly through capital leases in our bioanalytical laboratories in indiana  oregon and the uk capital investments for the purchase of additional laboratory equipment are driven by anticipated increases in research services  and by the replacement or upgrading of our equipment 
although we may consider strategic acquisition opportunities  we do not intend to aggressively pursue additional acquisitions until we fully utilize existing capacity 
we have notes payable to regions bank regions aggregating approximately  regions notes payable currently include two outstanding mortgages on our facilities in west lafayette and evansville  indiana  which total  the mortgages mature in november with an interest rate fixed at and monthly principal payments of approximately plus interest 
on november   we executed amendments on two loans with regions 
regions agreed to accept a principal payment on the note payable maturing on december  and a principal payment on one mortgage maturing on february  the principal payments were made on december  and february   respectively 
upon receipt of these two payments  regions incorporated the two loans into a replacement note payable for  maturing on november  the replacement note payable bears interest at a per annum rate equal to the day libor plus basis points minimum of with monthly principal payments of approximately plus interest 
the replacement note payable is secured by real estate at our west lafayette and evansville  indiana locations 
at september   the replacement note payable had a balance of  as part of the amendment  regions also agreed to amend the loan covenants for the related debt to be more favorable to us 
regions requires us to maintain certain ratios including a fixed charge coverage ratio and total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio 
the fixed charge coverage ratio calculation has been adjusted with an ending ratio required of not less than to 
also  the total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio has been adjusted to not greater than to 
provided we comply with the revised covenant ratios  which are common to such agreements  the amendment removes limitations on the company s purchase of fixed assets 
at september   we were in compliance with these covenants 
based on projections for fiscal  we expect to be in breach of the regions fixed charge covenant for our first fiscal quarter due to lower than expected income  which we do not expect to continue into the remainder of fiscal on december   regions waived compliance with this covenant for the period ending december  as a result of our first fiscal quarter results  we will likely be out of compliance with the fixed charge coverage for the second fiscal quarter ending march   as our covenants are calculated on a fiscal year cumulative basis  when we will again need to obtain a waiver from regions 
failure to obtain such waiver could accelerate the maturity of the loans and cause a cross default with our other lender 
borrowings under our credit agreements are collateralized by substantially all assets related to our operations and all common stock of our us subsidiaries and of the common stock of our non united states subsidiaries 
under the terms of our credit agreements  we have agreed to restrict advances to subsidiaries and limit additional indebtedness 
the regions loan agreements both contain cross default provisions with each other and with the revolving line of credit with entrepreneur growth capital llc egc described below 
the mortgages and replacement note payable with regions mature in the first quarter of fiscal we intend to refinance the amounts in lieu of making balloon payments for the remaining principal balances 
we may be unsuccessful in renegotiating the terms of the debt or they may be unfavorable to us 
for these reasons  if we are unsuccessful at refinancing our long term debt  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
revolving line of credit on january   we entered into a new  revolving line of credit agreement credit agreement with egc to replace the pnc bank line of credit that expired on january  the initial term of the credit agreement was set to expire on january  if we prepay prior to the expiration of the initial term or any renewal term  then we are subject to an early termination fee equal to the minimum interest charges of for each of the months remaining until expiration 
borrowings bear interest at an annual rate equal to citibank s prime rate plus five percent  or as of september   with minimum monthly interest of interest is paid monthly 
the line of credit also carries an annual facilities fee of and a collateral monitoring fee 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by a blanket lien on our personal property  including certain eligible accounts receivable  inventory  and intellectual property assets  and a second mortgage on our west lafayette and evansville real estate and all common stock of our us subsidiaries and of the common stock of our non united states subsidiary 
borrowings are calculated based on of eligible accounts receivable 
under the credit agreement  the company has agreed to restrict advances to subsidiaries  limit additional indebtedness and capital expenditures and comply with certain financial covenants outlined in the credit agreement 
on december   we negotiated an amendment to this credit agreement 
as part of the amendment  the maturity date was extended to january  the amendment reduced the minimum tangible net worth covenant requirement from  to  and waived all non compliances with this covenant through the date of the amendment 
the credit agreement also contains cross default provisions with the regions loans and any future egc loans 
at september   we were in compliance with the minimum tangible net worth covenant requirement 
based on our current business activities and cash on hand  we expect to borrow on our revolving credit facility in fiscal to finance working capital 
to conserve cash  we instituted a freeze on non essential capital expenditures 
as of september   we had  of total borrowing capacity with the line of credit  of which  was outstanding  and  of cash on hand 
for fiscal  we expect to see slow but continued improvement in the volume of new bookings  but little improvement in pricing 
we also expect improved gross profit margins due to cost controls implemented 
based on our expected increase in revenue  the availability on our line of credit  the impact of the cost reductions implemented and our successful equity offering in may  we project that we will have the liquidity required to meet our fiscal operations and debt obligations 
should operations materially fail to meet our expectations for the coming fiscal year  we may not be able to comply with all of our debt covenants  requiring that we obtain a waiver at that time 
if that situation arises  we will be required to negotiate with our lending bank again to obtain loan modifications or waivers as described above 
we cannot predict whether our lenders will provide those waivers  if required  what the terms of any such waivers might be or what impact any such waivers will have on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
we had an increase in our total borrowing capacity of  from  to  from the fiscal year ended september  primarily as a result of higher accounts receivable from higher revenues as well as our success in collecting receivables 
the following table summarizes the cash payments under our contractual term debt and other obligations at september  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future fiscal periods amounts in thousands 
the table does not include our revolving line of credit 
additional information on the debt is described in note  debt arrangements 
after total notes payable capital lease obligations operating leases we anticipate spending approximately million in fiscal on capital assets  primarily laboratory equipment which will be financed using capital leases 
equity offering amounts in this section not in thousands on may   we completed a registered public offering of  units at a price of  per unit 
each unit consists of one series a convertible preferred share which is convertible into common shares at a conversion price of per share  one class a warrant to purchase common shares at an exercise price of per share  and one class b warrant to purchase common shares at an exercise price of per share 
the designation  rights  preferences and other terms and provisions of the preferred shares are set forth in the certificate of designation 
until may   the series a preferred shares have a stated dividend rate of per annum  payable quarterly in cash or  subject to certain conditions  in common shares or a combination of cash and common shares  at our election 
after may   the series a preferred shares will participate in any dividends payable upon our common shares on an as converted basis 
if the preferred shares are converted prior to may   we must also pay to the converting holder in cash  or subject to certain conditions  in common shares or a combination thereof  per  of the stated value of the preferred shares less any dividends paid prior to conversion a make whole payment 
class a warrants are exercisable immediately and expire in may class b warrants are exercisable immediately and expire in may the net proceeds from the sale of the units  after deducting the fees and expenses of the placement agent and other expenses were million 
we intend to use the proceeds for the purchase of laboratory equipment and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
because the preferred dividend or make whole payment is triggered at the option of the preferred share holder  we recorded the dividend liability at the time of the offering close and will not have any preferred dividends subsequent to the fiscal quarter ended june  as of september    preferred shares have been converted into  common shares  including the make whole payments and  common shares have been issued for quarterly preferred dividends for remaining outstanding  unconverted preferred shares 
at september    preferred shares remain outstanding 
no warrants have been exercised as of september  inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 
critical accounting policies management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and liquidity and capital resources discusses the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and are considered critical accounting policies 
we have identified the following areas as critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition the majority of our service contracts involve the processing of bioanalytical samples for pharmaceutical companies 
these contracts generally provide for a fixed fee for each assay method developed or sample processed and revenue is recognized under the specific performance method of accounting 
under the specific performance method  revenue and related direct costs are recognized when services are performed 
other service contracts generally consist of preclinical studies for pharmaceutical companies 
service revenue is recognized based on the ratio of direct costs incurred to total estimated direct costs under the proportional performance method of accounting 
losses on contracts are provided in the period in which the loss becomes determinable 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected on a cumulative basis in the period in which such revisions become known 
the establishment of contract prices and total contract costs involves estimates made by the company at the inception of the contract period 
these estimates could change during the term of the contract which could impact the revenue and costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
projected losses on contracts are provided for in their entirety when known 
revisions to estimates have not been material 
service contract fees received upon acceptance are deferred and classified within customer advances  until earned 
unbilled revenues represent revenues earned under contracts in advance of billings 
product revenue from sales of equipment not requiring installation  testing or training is recognized upon shipment to customers 
one product includes internally developed software and requires installation  testing and training  which occur concurrently 
revenue from these sales is recognized upon completion of the installation  testing and training when the services are bundled with the equipment sale 
long lived assets  including goodwill long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized of the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we carry goodwill at cost 
other intangible assets with definite lives are stated at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
all intangible assets acquired that are obtained through contractual or legal right  or are capable of being separately sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  are recognized as an asset apart from goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment  and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired  using a two step process 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit  as computed primarily by present value cash flow calculations  to its book carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and we would then complete step in order to measure the impairment loss 
in step  the implied fair value is compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  we would recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference 
the implied fair value is calculated by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step to all of its assets and liabilities including unrecognized intangible assets and any excess in fair value that is not assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the discount rate and sales growth rates are the two material assumptions utilized in our calculations of the present value cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units when performing the annual goodwill impairment test 
our reporting units with goodwill at september  are vetronics  which is included in our products segment  mcminnville  oregon and evansville  indiana  which are both included in our services segment  based on the discrete financial information available which is reviewed by management 
we utilize a cash flow approach in estimating the fair value of the reporting units  where the discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital rate 
the cash flow model used to derive fair value is sensitive to the discount rate and sales growth assumptions used 
we performed our annual impairment test for all reporting units mentioned above at september  using a discount rate of and a revenue growth rate of  the fair values of our vetronics  oregon and evansville reporting units is greater than the carrying values by approximately million 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted sales growth rates and our cost of capital or discount rate  are based on the best available market information 
changes in these estimates or a continued decline in general economic conditions could change our conclusion regarding an impairment of goodwill and potentially result in a non cash impairment loss in a future period 
the assumptions used in our impairment testing could be adversely affected by certain of the risks discussed in risk factors in item a of this report 
there have been no significant events since the timing of our impairment tests that would have triggered additional impairment testing 
at september   remaining recorded goodwill was  and the net balance of other intangible assets was stock based compensation we recognize the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions in our financial statements using a fair value based method 
we measure compensation cost for all share based awards based on estimated fair values and recognize compensation over the vesting period for awards 
we recognized stock based compensation related to stock options of and during the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
we use the binomial option valuation model to determine the grant date fair value 
the determination of fair value is affected by our common stock price as well as assumptions regarding subjective and complex variables such as expected employee exercise behavior and our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award 
generally  our assumptions are based on historical information and judgment is required to determine if historical trends may be indicators of future outcomes 
we estimated the following key assumptions for the binomial valuation calculation risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
expected volatility 
we use our historical stock price volatility on our common stock for our expected volatility assumption 
expected term 
the expected term represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term is determined based on historical exercise behavior  post vesting termination patterns  options outstanding and future expected exercise behavior 
expected dividends 
we assumed that we will pay no dividends 
employee stock based compensation expense recognized in fiscal and was calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates and an adjustment will be recognized at that time 
changes to our underlying stock price  our assumptions used in the binomial option valuation calculation and our forfeiture rate as well as future grants of equity could significantly impact compensation expense recognized in future periods 
income tax accounting as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record valuation allowances based on a determination of the expected realization of tax assets 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position 
we measure the amount of the accrual for which an exposure exists as the largest amount of benefit determined on a cumulative probability basis that we believe is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the position 
we record interest and penalties accrued in relation to uncertain income tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
any changes in the accrued liability for uncertain tax positions would impact our effective tax rate 
over the next twelve months we do not anticipate resolution to the carrying value of our reserve
