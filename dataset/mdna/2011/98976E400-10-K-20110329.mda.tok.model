critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of zoom consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap requires it to make estimates and judgments that affect its reported assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
zoom based its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
future events  however  may differ markedly from current expectations and assumptions 
while there are a number of significant accounting policies affecting zoom consolidated financial statements  we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most complex  difficult and subjective estimates and judgments allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  asset impairment 
revenue recognition in accordance with us gaap  revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
noted below are brief descriptions of the product or service revenues that zoom recognizes in the financial statements contained herein 
the company recognizes sales in accordance with the us securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements fasb asc topic  revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services were rendered  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and  iv collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue is not recognized until title and risk of loss is transferred to the customer  which occurs upon delivery of goods  and objective evidence exists that customer acceptance provisions were met 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience taking into consideration the type of products sold  the type of customer  and the type of specific transaction in each arrangement 
revenues represent the invoiced value of goods  net of value added tax vat 
the company does not offer promotional payments  customer coupons  rebates or other cash redemption offers to its customers 
deposits or advance payments from customers prior to delivery of goods and passage of title of goods are recorded as advanced from customers 
company subsidiary  nollec wireless is in the mobile phone design  software integration and mobile solution r d business  nollec wireless  recognizes revenue under percentage of completion method asc topic construction type and production type contracts when reasonably dependable estimates can be made and in which all the following conditions exist a 
contracts executed by the parties normally include provisions that clearly specify the enforceable rights regarding goods or services to be provided and received by the parties  the consideration to be exchanged  and the manner and terms of settlement 
b 
the buyer can be expected to satisfy all obligations under the contract 
c 
the contractor can be expected to perform all contractual obligations 
estimates of cost to complete is reviewed periodically and revised as appropriate to reflect new information 
when the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract cost indicate a loss  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is made 
income is recognized as the percentage of estimated total income that incurred costs to date divided by estimated total costs after giving effect to estimates of costs to complete based on most recent information 
percentage of completion is based on labor hours incurred to date divided by total estimated labor hours for the contract 
royalty income on sales of licensed products by its customers is recorded when the customers report sales to the company 
royalty income is reported monthly and recorded in the period in which the product is sold 
the company has the right to audit the books of the licensees 
allowance for doubtful accounts zoom maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce amounts to their estimated realizable value 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when zoom assesses the realization of accounts receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts could be required 
zoom initially records a provision for doubtful accounts based on its historical experience  and then adjust this provision at the end of each reporting period based on a detailed assessment of its accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
in estimating the provision for doubtful accounts  zoom considers i the aging of the accounts receivable  ii trends within and ratios involving the age of the accounts receivable  iii the customer mix in each of the aging categories and the nature of the receivable  iv its historical provision for doubtful accounts  v the credit worthiness of the customer  and vi the economic conditions of the customer industry as well as general economic conditions  among other factors 
income taxes zoom accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
asc topic  accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for the estimated tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts and each year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized when  in management opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the provision for income taxes represents current taxes payable net of the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
zoom adopted fin asc topic  accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
asset impairment zoom periodically evaluates the carrying value of other long lived assets  including  but not limited to  property and equipment and intangible assets  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
significant estimates are utilized to calculate expected future cash flows utilized in impairment analyses 
zoom also utilizes judgment to determine other factors within fair value analyses  including the applicable discount rate

tcb digital manufactures digital communication and consumer electronic products with smt surface mount technology lines and assembly and test lines 
manufacturing equipment from our jiangsu leimone facilities were relocated to tcb digital in april our company combined production was approximately about million units in and million units in manufacturing of mobile phones is broken into two main segments non consignment ems where we procure all of the components for our customers  and our revenues comprise of the cost of the materials plus our manufacturing fee  and consignment ems where our customers provide the components and our revenues is our manufacturing fee

percentage of revenues by each activity non consignment ems consignment ems design revenues phone sales leimone brand total cost of sales for the year  zoom cost of sales was  or of revenues 
the cost of sales compared to revenues decreased by year over year 
the main reason for the decrease in this ratio was that the sales of our own brand products contributed a larger percentage to total revenues  and such own brand sales enjoyed a higher profit margin than the ems activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses sales and marketing expenses mainly represent salaries of sales personnel  and marketing and transportation costs 
general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of compensation for personnel  depreciation  travel expenses  rental  materials expenses related to ordinary administration  fees for professional services and also non cash equity based compensation charges

net income for  zoom net income was  with a net profit margin of  representing an increase of  or over net income in of  with a net profit margin of 
the increase in net income is mainly due to the increases in both our ems segment and sales of our own brand phones 
the increase in net margin is due to the increased proportion of revenues from sales of our own brand products which carry a higher profit margin than the ems business 
other comprehensive income for  our other comprehensive income was  while there was comprehensive loss of  for other comprehensive income resulted from foreign currency exchange changes particularly the renminbi appreciation against the us dollar resulting from our conversion of rmb into us for reporting  and we may report an expense or an income depending on changes in the exchange rate

risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors  together with all of the other information included in this annual report 
in assessing these risks  you should also refer to the other information included in this report  including the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
you should note that zoom is a holding company with substantial operations in the prc 
as a result  zoom would be subject to legal and regulatory environments that differ in many respects from those of the united states 
zoom business  financial condition or results of operations could be affected materially and adversely by any of the risks discussed below 
risks related to our business the operating businesses that we own indirectly through our subsidiaries  inclusive of tcb digital  jiangsu leimone  profit harvest  nollec wireless  and celestial digital entertainment collectively the zoom operating group including sales  results of operations  and reputation could be materially adversely affected if it fails to efficiently manage its manufacturing operations without interruption  or fails to ensure that its products meet the expectations of its distributors and end user customers 
operation of zoom operating group requires successful execution of complex manufacturing processes  including surface mount technology smt  precision assembly  calibration and testing  as well as software design and integration solutions 
the disruption of any of these could interrupt its revenue generation and have a material and adverse effect on zoom operating group relationships with distributors and end user customers  tcb digital and jiangsu leimone brand names  and its financial performance 
tcb digital and jiangsu leimone manufacturing operations involve raw material and component sourcing from third parties  internal assembly processes  and distribution processes 
these operations are modified on a regular basis in an effort to improve manufacturing and distribution efficiency and flexibility 
zoom operating group may experience difficulties in coordinating its supplies of components and raw materials to meet the demand for its products  increasing or decreasing production at its facilities in response to demand  adopting new manufacturing processes  finding a timely way to develop the best technical solutions for new products  or achieving manufacturing efficiency and flexibility 
zoom operating group may experience delays in adjusting or upgrading production at its facilities when it introduces new models  delays in expanding manufacturing capacity  failure in its manufacturing processes  or failure by its business partners to adequately perform the services it has outsourced to them  which in turn may have a material adverse effect on zoom operating group sales and results of operations 
in addition  a failure or an interruption could occur at any stage of zoom operating group product development  manufacturing and delivery processes  resulting in products not meeting the expectations of its distributors and end customers  which could have a material adverse effect on zoom operating group sales  results of operations  and reputation 
zoom operating group results of operations  particularly its profitability  may be materially adversely affected if it does not successfully manage price erosion and is not able to manage costs related to its products and operations 
selling price erosion is a characteristic of the mobile handset and electronics industries  and the products offered by zoom operating group are subject to natural price erosion over time 
if zoom operating group is not able to lower its costs at the same rate or faster than this selling price erosion  and to introduce new cost efficient products with higher prices in a timely manner  as well as manage costs related to its products and operations generally  this will have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations  particularly its profitability 
because our margins are already very thin  even minor price erosions  if not offset by increased efficiencies  will drastically reduce our profitability 
zoom operating group relies primarily on its distributors for marketing and sale of its products at the provincial and local levels and for after sales support of its products 
because zoom operating group has limited influence over its distributors  it cannot be certain that their marketing and after sale support of its products will be adequate to meet zoom operating group sales requirements and to protect zoom operating group brand and reputation 
zoom operating group now has distributors and after sales service centers at the national level  provincial level and municipal level in provinces in china 
zoom operating group grants its distributors the right to use its brand name and logo when they market zoom operating group products within their respective sales territories or channels and when they provide after sales support to zoom operating group end user customers 
however  zoom operating group contractual arrangements with its distributors do not provide zoom operating group with control over their everyday business activities  and one or more of its distributors may engage in activities that are prohibited under zoom operating group contractual arrangements with them  that violate peoples republic of china prc laws and regulations governing the mobile handset industry or other prc laws and regulations generally  or that are otherwise harmful to zoom operating group business or reputation in the industry 
further  because we are relatively new at marketing our leimone brand  and our leimone brand does not have the brand recognition of other brands in the industry  we have and will continue to rely heavily on the marketing efforts of these distributors 
zoom operating group maintains inventories of raw materials  components and handsets  and its inventories may decline in value or become obsolete 
the rapid technological change in zoom operating group industry  the short product life cycle of its handsets  its limited forecasting experience and processes  and the competitive nature of its target markets make forecasting zoom operating group future sales and operating results difficult 
zoom operating group expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations regarding future sales 
in addition  to enable zoom operating group to promptly fill orders  it maintains inventories of raw materials  components and handsets 
as a result  zoom operating group has to commit to considerable costs in advance of anticipated sales 
any significant shortfall of sales may result in zoom operating group maintaining higher levels of inventories of raw materials  components  and finished goods than it requires  thereby increasing its risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write downs and write offs 
zoom operating group cannot guarantee that such write downs will be adequate to cover all losses resulting from inventory obsolescence 
zoom operating group plans to market its products to countries outside of china  which may subject it to various economic  political  regulatory  legal and foreign exchange risks 
zoom operating group currently sells substantially all of its products in china 
zoom operating group also plans to selectively enter into markets outside china where it identifies an opportunity to sell differentiated products and where it believes it will be able to realize a reasonable return on investment 
the marketing  distribution and sale of its mobile handsets overseas exposes zoom operating group to a number of risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates of the us dollar and other foreign currencies against the renminbi  difficulty in engaging and retaining distributors and agents who are knowledgeable about  and can function effectively in  overseas markets  difficulty in designing products that are compatible with communications and product standards in foreign countries  and in attaining the required certifications for those products  longer accounts receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  increased costs associated with maintaining marketing and sales activities in various countries  difficulty and costs relating to compliance with unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and different commercial and legal requirements in the jurisdictions in which zoom operating group offers its products  inability to obtain  maintain or enforce intellectual property rights  and changes to import and export regulations  including quotas  tariffs and other trade barriers  delays or difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses  potential foreign exchange controls and repatriation controls on foreign earnings  exchange rate fluctuations  and currency conversion restrictions 
if zoom operating group is unable to effectively manage these risks  its ability to conduct or expand its business abroad would be impaired  and this may in turn have a material adverse effect on zoom operating group business  financial condition  results of operations  and prospects 
zoom operating group operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period in the future 
zoom operating group operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on a number of factors such as the launch of new products in a given period  the seasonality of its mobile handset sales  the short life cycle of any given handset model due to rapid technological advances  a possible deterioration of economic conditions in china  and potential changes to the regulation of the mobile handset industry in china 
as a result  you may not be able to rely on period to period comparisons of zoom operating group operating results as an indication of its future performance 
if its revenues for a particular period are lower than zoom operating group expects  its may be unable to reduce its fixed costs and operating expenses for that period by a corresponding amount  which would negatively impact its operating results for that period relative to its operating results for other periods 
zoom operating group has not applied for patents or registered copyrights for most of its intellectual property  and its failure to adequately protect its intellectual property rights may undermine its competitive position 
implementation of prc intellectual property related laws has historically been lacking  primarily because of ambiguities in prc laws and difficulties in enforcement 
accordingly  intellectual property rights and confidentiality protections in china may not be as effective as in the united states or other countries 
zoom operating group relies primarily on trade secrets and other contractual restrictions to protect its intellectual property 
zoom operating group has not applied for patents or registered copyrights in china for most of its inventions  original works of authorship  developments  and improvements relating to the mobile handsets it produces 
the actions zoom operating group has taken to protect its intellectual property rights may not be adequate to provide it with meaningful protection or commercial advantage 
as a result  third parties may use the technologies that it has developed and compete with zoom operating group  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and operating results 
litigation to protect zoom operating group intellectual property rights may be costly 
policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive 
litigation may be necessary to enforce zoom operating group intellectual property rights and the outcome of any such litigation may not be in zoom operating group favor 
given the relative unpredictability of china legal system and potential difficulties in enforcing a court judgment in china  there is no guarantee that zoom operating group would be able to halt the unauthorized use of its intellectual property through litigation in a timely manner 
furthermore  any such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention away from zoom operating group business and cause it to expend significant resources 
an adverse determination in any such litigation will impair zoom operating group intellectual property rights and may harm its business  prospects and reputation 
in addition  zoom operating group has no insurance coverage against litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent it is unable to recover them from other parties 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on zoom operating group business  financial condition and results of operations 
zoom operating group may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties which  if determined adversely against it  could disrupt its business and subject it to significant liability to third parties  as well as have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
zoom operating group success depends  in large part  on its ability to use and develop its technology  know how and product designs without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties 
zoom operating group products include increasingly complex technology and  as the amount of such technologies and the number of parties claiming rights continue to increase  the possibility of alleged infringement and related intellectual property claims against it continues to rise 
the holders of patents and other intellectual property rights potentially relevant to zoom operating group product offerings may be unknown to zoom operating group  or may otherwise make it difficult for zoom operating group to acquire a license on commercially acceptable terms 
there may also be technologies licensed to and relied on by zoom operating group that are subject to infringement or other corresponding allegations or claims by others which could damage its ability to rely on such technologies 
in addition  although zoom operating group endeavors to ensure that companies that work with it possess appropriate intellectual property rights or licenses  zoom operating group cannot fully avoid the risks of intellectual property rights infringement created by suppliers of components used in its products or by companies with which it works in cooperative research and development activities 
since technology standards  including those used and relied on by zoom operating group  typically involve intellectual property rights  zoom operating group cannot fully avoid risks of a claim for infringement of such rights due to its reliance on such standards 
zoom operating group believes that the number of third parties declaring their intellectual property to be relevant to these standards for example  those standards related to g mobile communication technologies as well as other advanced mobile communications standards is increasing  which may increase the likelihood that zoom operating group will be subject to such claims in the future 
while zoom operating group believes that any such intellectual property rights declared and found to be essential to a given standard carry with them an obligation to be licensed on fair  reasonable and non discriminatory terms  not all intellectual property owners agree on the meaning of that obligation and  thus  costly and time consuming litigation over such issues may result in the future 
as zoom operating group continues to market and sell its products throughout china  and as litigation becomes more common in china  zoom operating group may face a higher risk of becoming subject to claims for intellectual property infringement 
while zoom operating group has not  to date  become subject to these types of claims  it is possible that it may  in the future  become subject to such intellectual property infringement claims 
regardless of whether such claims have merit or are decided in its favor  any such litigation could have a negative impact on zoom operating group brand  reputation and ability to conduct its business and sell some or all of its products 
zoom operating group sales and profitability depend on the continued growth of the mobile telecommunications industry  especially in china  and if the mobile telecommunications industry does not grow as zoom operating group expects or grows at a slower speed than zoom operating group expects  its sales and profitability may be materially adversely affected 
zoom operating group derives substantially all of its revenues from sales of mobile handsets in china 
the continued development of its business depends  in large part  on continued growth in the mobile telecommunications industry  especially in china  in terms of the number of existing mobile subscribers who upgrade or replace their existing mobile handsets  the number of new subscribers  and increased usage 
although china wireless telecommunication industry has grown rapidly in the past  and although china government has granted g licenses to operators  the wireless telecommunication industry may not continue to grow at the same growth rate in the future or to grow at all 
furthermore  zoom operating group sales and profitability are also affected by the extent to which there is increasing demand for  and development of  value added services  leading to opportunities for it to successfully market mobile handsets that feature those services 
to a certain extent  zoom operating group is dependent on third party mobile telecommunication operators to successfully introduce these value added services that encourage end users to upgrade or replace their mobile handsets 
for instance  mobile telecommunication operators in china are upgrading their networks to offer g wireless telecommunication services  which will lead to increased demand for enhanced wireless value added services and  therefore  increased demand for mobile handsets with more advanced technologies in china 
therefore  if mobile telecommunication operators are not successful in their attempts to introduce new services  increase the number of subscribers  stimulate increased usage and drive replacement sales  its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
these developments in its industry are  to a large extent  outside of zoom operating group control  and any reduced demand for wireless voice and data services  any other downturn  or other adverse changes in china wireless telecommunication industry could severely harm its business 
changes in the regulatory environment for telecommunications systems and services  especially in china  could negatively impact zoom operating group business 
the telecommunications industry in china is heavily regulated  and regulatory changes may affect both zoom operating group and its customers 
for example  changes in regulations that impose more stringent standards for the production of mobile handsets could adversely affect zoom operating group business 
similarly  tariff regulations that affect the pricing of new services offered by mobile telecommunication operators could also affect their ability to invest in network infrastructure  which in turn could affect the sales of zoom operating group mobile handsets 
license fees  environmental  health and safety  privacy and other regulatory changes may increase costs and restrict operations of mobile telecommunication network operators and service providers 
the indirect impact of such changes could affect zoom operating group business adversely even though the specific regulations may not directly apply to it or its products 
china ministry of industry and information technology miit has broad discretion and authority to regulate all aspects of the telecommunications and information technology industries in china  including managing spectrum  setting mobile handset specifications and standards  approving the adoption of new technologies such as g  and drafting laws and regulations 
miit also determines the forms and types of services that may be offered by telecommunication companies to the public  the rates that are charged to subscribers for those services  and the content of material available in china over wireless services  including internet content 
in addition  china telecommunication regulatory framework is still at a relatively early stage of development  and prone to directional shifts and major structural changes 
the prc government is in the process of drafting a national telecommunication law  which may include new legislation governing the mobile handset industry 
if miit sets standards with which zoom operating group is unable to comply or which would render zoom operating group products uncompetitive  its ability to sell products could be severely limited  resulting in substantial harm to zoom operating group operations 
zoom operating group depends on its key personnel  and its business and growth may be severely disrupted if it loses their services 
zoom operating group may also have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified management and research and development personnel 
zoom operating group future success depends substantially on the continued services of its key personnel 
zoom operating group relies on key personnel experience in the mobile handset manufacturing industry  in similar business operations  in sales and marketing  and on their relationships with zoom operating group shareholders  customers  and suppliers 
if zoom operating group loses the services of one or more of these key personnel  it may not be able to replace them readily  if at all  with suitable or qualified candidates  and may incur additional expenses to recruit and retain new officers  which could severely disrupt its business and growth 
in addition  if any of these key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company  zoom operating group may lose some of its customers 
zoom operating group has entered into employment agreements with each of these key personnel  which contain confidentiality and non competition provisions 
however  if any disputes arise between these key personnel and zoom operating group  it is not clear what the court decisions will be and the extent to which these court decisions could be enforced in china  where all of these key personnel reside and hold some of their assets 
furthermore  as zoom operating group expects to continue to expand its operations and develop new products  zoom operating group will need to continue attracting and retaining experienced management and key research and development personnel 
competition for management and research and development personnel in the mobile handset market in china is intense  and the availability of suitable and qualified candidates is limited 
in particular  zoom operating group competes to attract and retain qualified research and development personnel with other mobile handset manufacturers  universities and research institutions 
competition for these individuals could cause zoom operating group to offer higher compensation and other benefits in order to attract and retain them  which could have a material adverse effect on zoom operating group financial condition and results of operations 
zoom operating group may also be unable to attract or retain the personnel necessary to achieve its business objectives  and any failure in this regard could severely disrupt its business and growth 
fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect zoom operating group business 
because substantially all of its earnings are denominated in renminbi  any appreciation or depreciation in the value of the renminbi relative to the us dollar would affect zoom operating group balance sheet position and financial results reported in us dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in its business or results of operations 
in addition  fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the renminbi would affect the relative purchasing power of zoom operating group us dollar denominated cash assets and the renminbi value of zoom operating group us dollar denominated bank borrowings 
fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend zoom operating group may issue that will be exchanged into us dollars  and will affect the earnings from and value of any us dollar denominated investments it makes in the future 
zoom operating group competitive position could decline if it is unable to obtain additional financing to acquire businesses or technologies that are strategic for its success  or otherwise execute its business strategy 
zoom operating group believes that its current cash will be sufficient to fund its working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  zoom operating group may need to raise additional funds to support capital expansion  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or respond to unanticipated requirements 
zoom operating group cannot assure you that additional funding will be available to it in amounts or on terms acceptable to zoom operating group 
if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  zoom operating group ability to fund its expansion  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance its services or products  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
if appropriate opportunities arise  zoom operating group intends to acquire businesses  technologies  services or products that it believes are strategic 
the lease on jiangsu leimone corporate office and production space expired in january and our manufacturing equipment from jiangsu leimone has been relocated to tcb digital in tianjin 
we may not be able to acquire a lease on another suitable property  or a lease on a suitable property at a comparable cost 
the lease on jiangsu leimone corporate office and production space expired in january  and we currently maintain office space only on a month to month basis 
we have already relocated jiangsu leimone manufacturing equipment to tcb digital facilities in tianjin as of april  in the event we need to restart production in jiangsu  we would need to relocate into another suitable property  which we may not be attainable at a comparable cost in a timely manner 
even if we are able to do so  we would incur significant moving expenses and manufacturing delays 
risks related to our industry if zoom operating group cannot keep pace with market changes and produce mobile phones with new technologies and features in a timely and cost efficient manner to meet its customers requirements and preferences  the growth and success of its business will be materially adversely affected 
the mobile handset market in china is characterized by changing consumer preferences with respect to style and functionality  increasing demand for new and advanced technologies and features  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion  evolving industry standards  intense competition and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
if zoom operating group cannot keep pace with market changes and produce new mobile handsets in a timely and cost efficient manner to meet its customers requirements and preferences  the growth and success of its business will be materially adversely affected 
zoom operating group experiences intensive competition from its electronics manufacturing service ems competitors  zoom operating group failure to maintain its relationship with clients may have material adverse impact on its business and profitability 
in recent years  more and more ems providers have invested heavily in the northern part of china and particularly in the bo hai area where tianjin city is located 
zoom operating group oem customers are also giving more orders to other ems providers to balance their need and reduce their risk 
zoom operating group will attempt to provide better services and higher quality products to attract more customers and reduce its risk from fierce competition 
competition in mobile phone manufacture and sales is intense 
zoom operating group failure to maintain or improve its market position and respond successfully to changes in the competitive landscape may have a material adverse impact on its business and results of operations 
the mobile handset manufacturing industry in china is intensely competitive 
industry participants compete with each other mainly on the basis of the breadth and depth of their product portfolios  price  operational and manufacturing efficiency  technical performance  product features  quality  customer support and brand recognition 
zoom operating group faces significant competition from a number of competitors  including domestic mobile handset producers such as bird ningbo co  ltd  haier telecom co 
ltd   konka group co  ltd  lenovo group limited  and tcl communication technology holdings limited 
and a number of large multinational mobile handset producers  such as lg electronics ltd  motorola inc  nokia corporation  samsung electronics co  ltd  and sony ericsson mobile communications china co  ltd 
many of zoom operating group competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  significantly larger market shares  access to larger customer bases and significantly greater economies of scale and financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than zoom operating group does 
some of these competitors have used  and will probably continue to use  more aggressive pricing strategies  greater amounts of sales incentives and subsidies for distributors  retailers and customers  more successful design approaches  and more advanced technologies 
in addition  some competitors have chosen to focus on building products based on commercially available components  which may enable them to introduce these products faster and with lower levels of research and development spending than zoom operating group 
furthermore  consolidation among the industry participants in china may potentially result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as end to end suppliers as well as competitors who are more specialized in particular areas and geographic markets 
this could have a material adverse effect on zoom operating group business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
zoom operating group may be unable to manage rapid growth and a changing operating environment  which could adversely affect its ability to serve its customers and could harm its business 
zoom operating group has experienced rapid growth over the last few years 
zoom operating group has limited operational  administrative and financial resources  which may be inadequate to sustain its current growth rate 
if zoom operating group is unable to manage its growth effectively  the quality of its solutions could deteriorate and its business may suffer 
as its customer base increases and it enters new end markets  zoom operating group will need to increase its investments in personnel  research and development capabilities  facilities and other operational areas  continue training  motivating and retaining its existing employees  and attract and integrate new qualified employees  develop and improve its operational  financial  accounting and other internal systems and controls  and take enhanced measures to protect any proprietary technology or technological capability it develops 
any failure to manage zoom operating group growth successfully could distract management attention and result in its failure to serve its customers and harm its business 
we have depended on a small number of customers for the vast majority of our sales 
a reduction in business from any of these customers could cause a significant decline in our sales and profitability 
the vast majority of our sales are generated from a small number of customers 
during the year ended december   we had three customers that generated revenues of at least of our total revenues  with our largest customer accounted for of our revenues 
we believe that we may continue to depend upon a small number of customers for a significant majority of our sales in the future  and the loss or reduction in business from any of these customers could cause a significant decline in our sales and profitability 
risks related to doing business in china adverse changes in political and economic policies of the prc government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of china  which could reduce the demand for zoom operating group products and materially adversely affect its competitive position 
zoom operating group conducts substantially all of its operations and generates most of its revenues in china 
accordingly  its business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects are affected significantly by economic  political and legal developments in china 
the prc economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects  including the higher level of government involvement  the early stage of development of the market oriented sector of the economy  the rapid growth rate  the higher level of control over foreign exchange  and the allocation of resources 
while the prc economy has grown significantly since the late s  the growth has been uneven  both geographically and among various sectors of the economy 
the prc government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources 
some of these measures benefit the overall prc economy  but may also have a negative effect on zoom operating group 
for example  zoom operating group financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over the telecommunications industry  capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to it 
the prc economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market oriented economy 
although the prc government has in recent years implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform  the prc government continues to exercise significant control over economic growth in china through the allocation of resources  controlling payment of foreign currency denominated obligations  setting monetary policy  and imposing policies that impact particular industries or companies in different ways 
for example  efforts by the prc government to slow the pace of growth of the prc economy could result in decreased capital expenditure by mobile telecommunication network operators  which in turn could reduce demand for its products 
any adverse change in the economic conditions or government policies in china could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth and the level of mobile communications investments and expenditures in china  which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for zoom operating group products and consequently have a material adverse effect on its business and prospects 
in particular  any adverse change in the prc government policies towards the mobile communications industry may have a material adverse effect on zoom operating group business 
we may have difficulty establishing adequate management  legal and financial controls in the prc 
most prc companies historically have been less focused on establishing western style management and financial reporting concepts and practices  as well as modern banking  computer and other internal control systems  than companies in the us and certain other western countries 
we may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified internal control employees to work in the prc 
as a result of these factors  we may experience difficulty in establishing management  legal and financial controls  collecting financial data  preparing financial statements  books of account and corporate records  and instituting business practices that meet western standards
