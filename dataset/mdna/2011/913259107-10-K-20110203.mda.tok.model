as a result of electric industry restructuring  the company has a significant amount of stranded electric generation and power supply related supply costs 
if the company is unable to recover a significant amount of stranded costs in its rates  or if the company s recovery of stranded costs in its rates is significantly delayed  then the company s financial condition or results or operations could be adversely affected 
the stranded electric generation and power supply related supply costs resulting from the implementation of electric industry restructuring mandated by the states of new hampshire and massachusetts are recovered by the company on a pass through basis through periodically reconciled rates 
any unrecovered balance of stranded costs is deferred for future recovery as a regulatory asset 
such regulatory assets are subject to periodic regulatory review and approval for recovery in future periods 
substantially all of the company s stranded costs relate to i unitil power s long term power purchase agreements which unitil power divested under long term contract buyout agreements and ii fitchburg s formerly owned generation assets and purchase power agreements which fitchburg divested under a long term contract buy out agreement 
unitil power made the final payment on its long term contract buyout agreements in october  which ended its obligations in the underlying purchase power contracts 
as a result  in accordance with its retail stranded cost recovery rates  substantially all of unitil energy s stranded costs are projected to be fully recovered by july  because fitchburg continues to remain ultimately responsible for purchase power payments underlying its long term buyout agreements  fitchburg could incur additional stranded costs were they required to resell such divested entitlements prior to the end of their term for amounts less than the amounts agreed to under the existing long term buyout agreements 
the company expects that any such additional stranded costs would be recovered from its customers  however such recovery would require approval from the mdpu  the receipt of which cannot be assured 
if the company is unable to recover a significant amount of such stranded costs in its rates  or if the company s recovery of such stranded costs in its rates is significantly delayed  then the company s financial condition or results or operations could be adversely affected

the company requires capital to fund utility plant additions  working capital and other utility expenditures 
while the company derives the capital necessary to meet these requirements primarily from internally generated funds  the company supplements internally generated funds by incurring short term debt under its current credit facility  as needed 
if the lending counterparties under the company s current credit facility are unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations  then the company may be unable to  or limited in its ability to  incur short term debt under its credit facility 
this could hinder or prevent the company from meeting its current and future capital needs  which could correspondingly adversely affect the company s financial condition or results or operations 
also  from time to time  the company repays portions of its short term debt with the proceeds it receives from long term debt financings or equity financings

an increase in the company s interest expense could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
as of december   the company had approximately million in short term debt outstanding under its revolving credit facility 
the company s long term debt typically has fixed interest rates 
therefore  changes in interest rates will not affect the company s interest expense associated with its presently outstanding fixed rate long term debt 
however  an increase or decrease in interest rates may increase or decrease the company s interest expense associated with any new fixed rate long term debt issued by the company  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations

table of contents a significant amount of the company s sales are temperature sensitive 
because of this  mild winter and summer temperatures could decrease the company s sales  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results or operations 
also  the company s sales may vary from year to year depending on weather conditions  and the company s results of operations generally reflect seasonality 
the company estimates that approximately of its annual natural gas sales are temperature sensitive 
therefore  mild winter temperatures could decrease the amount of natural gas sold by the company  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s electric sales also are temperature sensitive  but less so than its natural gas sales 
the highest usage of electricity typically occurs in the summer months due to air conditioning demand and the winter months due to heating related and lighting requirements 
therefore  mild summer temperatures and mild winter temperatures could decrease the amount of electricity sold by the company  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
also  because of this temperature sensitivity  sales by the company s distribution utilities vary from year to year  depending on weather conditions 
in addition  the company s results of operations generally reflect seasonality 
in particular  the company expects that results of operations will be positively affected during the first and fourth quarters  when sales of natural gas are typically higher due to heating related requirements  and negatively affected during the second and third quarters  when gas operating and maintenance expenses usually exceed sales margins in the period 
long term global climate change could adversely affect customer demand or cause extreme weather events that could disrupt the company s electric and natural gas distribution services 
milder winter and summer temperatures due to long term global climate change may cause a decrease in the amount of natural gas and electricity sold by the company  which could correspondingly adversely affect the company s financial condition and results or operations 
conversely  colder winter temperatures and warmer summer temperatures due to long term global climate change may cause an increase in the amount of natural gas and electricity sold by the company 
in addition  extreme weather events such as hurricanes and severe winter storms related to long term global climate change may damage facilities or result in increased service interruptions and outages and increase the company s operations and maintenance costs 
if the company is unable to recover a significant amount of such costs in its rates  or if the company s recovery of such costs in its rates is significantly delayed  then the company s financial condition or results or operations could be adversely affected 
the company is unable to predict the impacts on its financial condition and results or operations due to changes in weather related to long term global climate change

in an order issued on july   the mpuc approved a settlement agreement resolving this matter  filed on behalf of northern utilities  the maine office of the public advocate  and several state legislator intervenors  which was filed with the mpuc on july  under the agreement  northern utilities will proceed with a comprehensive upgrade and replacement program the program  which will provide for the systematic replacement of cast iron  wrought iron and bare steel pipe in northern utilities natural gas distribution system in portland and westbrook  maine and the conversion of the system to intermediate pressure 
the agreement establishes the objective of completing the program by the end of the construction season 
under the agreement  the parties agreed to support a cost recovery mechanism that will provide for the timely recovery of prudently incurred costs of the program 
the features of this cost recovery mechanism will be finalized during northern utilities next base rate case proceeding  which is anticipated to be filed in early environmental matters unitil s past and present operations include activities that are generally subject to extensive and complex federal and state environmental laws and regulations 
the company believes it is in compliance with applicable environmental and safety laws and regulations  and the company believes that as of december   there were no material losses reasonably likely to be incurred in excess of recorded amounts 
however  there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future 
it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly stringent federal  state or local environmental laws and regulations could result in increased environmental compliance costs

critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in making those estimates and assumptions  the company is sometimes required to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about the impact of matters that are inherently uncertain and for which different estimates that could reasonably have been used could have resulted in material differences in its financial statements 
if actual results were to differ significantly from those estimates  assumptions and judgment  the financial position of the company could be materially affected and the results of operations of the company could be materially different than reported 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting policies  which are defined as those policies where 
table of contents judgments or uncertainties could materially affect the application of those policies 
for a complete discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to the financial statements and note summary of significant accounting policies 
regulatory accounting the company s principal business is the distribution of electricity and natural gas by the three distribution utilities unitil energy  fitchburg and northern utilities 
unitil energy and fitchburg are subject to regulation by the ferc 
fitchburg is also regulated by the mdpu  unitil energy is regulated by the nhpuc and northern utilities is regulated by the mpuc and nhpuc 
granite state  the company s natural gas transmission pipeline  is regulated by the ferc 
accordingly  the company uses the regulated operations guidance as set forth in the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb codification 
in accordance with the fasb codification  the company has recorded regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities which will be recovered from customers  or applied for customer benefit  in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission 
the fasb codification specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise 
revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred 
if regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future  these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets 
if revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future  these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities 
the company s principal regulatory assets and liabilities are included on the company s consolidated balance sheet and a summary of the company s regulatory assets is provided in note thereto 
the company receives a return on investment on its regulated assets for which a cash outflow has been made 
regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs  which can have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company believes it is probable that its regulated distribution and transmission utilities will recover their investments in long lived assets  including regulatory assets 
if the company  or a portion of its assets or operations  were to cease meeting the criteria for application of these accounting rules  accounting standards for businesses in general would become applicable and immediate recognition of any previously deferred costs  or a portion of deferred costs  would be required in the year in which the criteria are no longer met  if such deferred costs were not recoverable in the portion of the business that continues to meet the criteria for application of the fasb codification topic on regulated operations 
if unable to continue to apply the fasb codification provisions for regulated operations  the company would be required to apply the provisions for the discontinuation of rate regulated accounting included in the fasb codification 
in the company s opinion  its regulated operations will be subject to the fasb codification provisions for regulated operations for the foreseeable future 
utility revenue recognition regulated utility revenues are based on rates and charges approved by federal and state regulatory commissions 
revenues related to the sale of electric and gas service are recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers 
however  the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each calendar month  amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated 
this unbilled revenue is estimated each month based on estimated customer usage by class and applicable customer rates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company recognizes a provision for doubtful accounts each month based upon the company s experience in collecting electric and gas utility service accounts receivable in prior years 
at the end of each month  an analysis of the delinquent receivables is performed which takes into account an assumption about the cash recovery of delinquent receivables 
the analysis also calculates the amount of written off receivables that are recoverable through regulatory rate reconciling mechanisms 
the company s distribution utilities are authorized by regulators to recover the costs of their energy commodity portion of bad debts through rate mechanisms 
evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires judgment about the assumptions used in the analysis  including expected fuel assistance payments from governmental authorities and the level of customers enrolling in payment plans with the company 
it has been the company s experience that the assumptions it has used in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts have proven to be reasonably accurate 

table of contents retirement benefit obligations the company sponsors the unitil corporation retirement plan pension plan  which is a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of its employees 
the company also sponsors an unfunded retirement plan  the unitil corporation supplemental executive retirement plan serp  covering certain executives of the company and an employee k savings plan 
additionally  the company sponsors the unitil employee health and welfare benefits plan pbop plan  primarily to provide health care and life insurance benefits to retired employees 
the fasb codification requires companies to record on their balance sheets as an asset or liability the overfunded or underfunded status of their retirement benefit obligations rbo based on the projected benefit obligation 
the company has recognized a corresponding regulatory asset  to recognize the future collection of these obligations in electric and gas rates 
the company s rbo and reported costs of providing retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
the company has made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions  including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets  future compensation  health care cost trends  and appropriate discount rates 
the company s rbo are affected by actual employee demographics  the level of contributions made to the plans  earnings on plan assets  and health care cost trends 
changes made to the provisions of these plans may also affect current and future costs 
if these assumptions were changed  the resultant change in benefit obligations  fair values of plan assets  funded status and net periodic benefit costs could have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
the discount rate assumptions used in determining retirement plan costs and retirement plan obligations are based on a market average of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
for the years ended december  and  a change in the discount rate of would have resulted in an increase or decrease of approximately  and  respectively  in the net periodic benefit cost for the pension plan 
for the years ended december  and  a increase in the assumption of health care cost trend rates would have resulted in increases in the net periodic benefit cost for the pbop plan of  and  respectively 
similarly  a decrease in the assumption of health care cost trend rates for those same time periods would have resulted in decreases in the net periodic benefit cost for the pbop plan of  and  respectively 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company is subject to federal and state income taxes as well as various other business taxes 
this process involves estimating the company s current tax liabilities as well as assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from the timing of the deductions of expenses and recognition of taxable income for tax and book accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company accounts for income tax assets  liabilities and expenses in accordance with the fasb codification guidance on income taxes 
provisions for income taxes are calculated in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates for each period for which a statement of earnings is presented 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the fasb codification guidance on income taxes which requires an asset and liability approach for the financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the current and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company s current and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect its best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
periodically  the company assesses the realization of its deferred tax assets and liabilities and adjusts the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts and circumstances which gave rise to the revision become known 
depreciation depreciation expense is calculated on a group straight line basis based on the useful lives of assets and judgment is involved when estimating the useful lives of certain assets 
the company conducts independent depreciation studies on a periodic basis as part of the regulatory ratemaking process and considers the results presented in these studies in determining the useful lives of the company s fixed assets 
a change in the estimated useful lives of these assets could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
commitments and contingencies the company s accounting policy is to record and or disclose commitments and contingencies in accordance with the fasb codification as it applies to an existing 
table of contents condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
as of december   the company is not aware of any material commitments or contingencies other than those disclosed in the significant contractual obligations table in the contractual obligations section above and the commitments and contingencies footnote to the company s consolidated financial statements below 
refer to recently issued accounting pronouncements in note of the notes of consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards 
for further information regarding these types of activities  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  note  income taxes  note  energy supply  note  retirement benefit plans  and note  commitment and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk please also refer to item a 
risk factors 
interest rate risk as discussed above  unitil meets its external financing needs by issuing short term and long term debt 
the majority of debt outstanding represents long term notes bearing fixed rates of interest 
changes in market interest rates do not affect interest expense resulting from these outstanding long term debt securities 
however  the company periodically repays its short term debt borrowings through the issuance of new long term debt securities 
changes in market interest rates may affect the interest rate and corresponding interest expense on any new issuances of long term debt securities 
in addition  short term debt borrowings bear a variable rate of interest 
as a result  changes in short term interest rates will increase or decrease interest expense in future periods 
for example  if the average amount of short term debt outstanding was million for the period of one year  a change in interest rates of would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately  the average interest rate on short term borrowings was   and during   and  respectively 
market risk although unitil s three distribution utilities are subject to commodity price risk as part of their traditional operations  the current regulatory framework within which these companies operate allows for full collection of electric power and natural gas supply costs in rates on a pass through basis 
consequently  there is limited commodity price risk after consideration of the related rate making 
additionally  as discussed above and below in regulatory matters  the company has divested its commodity related contracts and therefore  further reduced its exposure to commodity risk
