all estimates referred to in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to the company s estimates as of november  dispositions in fiscal  the company sold its european refuse collection vehicle business  geesink  to a third party for nominal cash consideration 
in spite of aggressive actions during the previous three fiscal years to restructure this business and return it to profitability  the business continued to incur operating losses for the first nine months of fiscal the company believed that its performance could be enhanced by redeploying its resources from geesink to support the company s other businesses 
the company has reflected the financial results of geesink as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
the company recorded a million non cash  pre tax gain on the sale 

table of contents in october  the company completed the sale of its interest in bai  the company s european fire apparatus and equipment business  to bai s management team for nominal cash consideration 
bai  which was included in the company s fire emergency segment  had sales of million in fiscal the company recorded a small loss on the sale of bai in the first quarter of fiscal the company has reflected the financial results of bai as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reorganized geesink s european parent holding company and claimed a worthless stock and bad debt deduction  which resulted in a million tax benefit  of which million related to geesink and bai and was therefore included in discontinued operations 
executive overview as expected  fiscal sales and operating income decreased following a year of record sales and profitability in fiscal when the company delivered  urgently needed  life saving m atvs to the dod 
while m atv sales  including related parts services sales  decreased billion from fiscal to fiscal  an increase in access equipment sales to external customers and the start up of fmtv production during fiscal offset some of the m atv sales decrease 
as a result  consolidated net sales decreased billion  or  to billion compared to fiscal although the increase in sales to external customers in the access equipment segment and the ramp up of fmtv production in the defense segment offset some of the decrease in m atv sales  the incremental access equipment sales were at lower margins than m atv sales 
in addition  the company incurred million of start up costs on the ramp up of the fmtv contract which drove costs to exceed revenues by million on this program during fiscal as a result of the lower m atv sales  lower margins on the incremental access equipment sales and cost challenges on the fmtv program  operating income in fiscal decreased million  or  from fiscal  to million 
in august  the dod awarded the company the contract to be the sole producer of fmtvs under the us army s fmtv rebuy program 
this was an important contract for the company to win due to high unfulfilled requirements of the dod s authorized acquisition objective or maximum acquisition quantity under the fmtv program  while the company s fhtv program was nearing fulfillment of its authorized acquisition objective 
after a lengthy protest  the dod ordered trucks in the first contract year at a level approximately three times higher than the likely amount communicated by the dod in the request for proposal due to favorable pricing on the program and prior to a scheduled contractual price increase 
as a result  when the company initiated production  the company incurred higher than planned costs to hire and train more than additional employees than anticipated and was required to purchase additional equipment and tooling  as well as deliver vehicles at lower pricing than expected 
the company also experienced issues associated with building to the dod s technical data package  which did not accurately reflect the current configuration of the trucks and trailers  and complying with new requirements in the contract  among other issues 
the company began delivering vehicles under this contract in the first quarter of fiscal while the company worked through these issues  it incurred unplanned start up costs of million in fiscal and reported a total loss on the contract for the year of million 
the company expects to continue to incur costs in excess of revenues on the fmtv contract through the first quarter of fiscal  although at amounts lower than in fiscal  but expects its fmtv sales beginning in the second quarter of fiscal to be profitable 
the company has eleven integrated project teams working to improve its performance on this contract 
this is a top priority for management and is increasingly important as fmtv sales rise as a percentage of total defense sales in fiscal years and the company expects that fmtv program revenues for production beyond september  on orders received to date will exceed expected costs and  therefore  has not recorded a charge for a loss contract 
in evaluating the profitability under the fmtv contract  it is necessary to estimate future material and production costs 
management cost assumptions include estimates for future increases in the costs of materials  reductions in ramp up costs  targeted cost savings and production efficiencies 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these estimates 
small changes in estimates can have a significant impact on profitability under the contract 
for example  a escalation in material costs over the company s projection for fmtv orders currently in backlog would increase the cost of materials by approximately million 
although this amount is less than the expected future profitability  it would significantly reduce the expected future gross margins on orders currently in backlog 
it is possible that other assumptions underlying the analysis could change in such a manner that the company would determine in the future that this is a loss contract  which could result in a material charge to earnings 

table of contents in fiscal  the company completed a comprehensive strategic planning process to  among other things  assess the outlook for each of its markets  consider strategic alternatives and develop strategic initiatives to address the current difficult market forces then facing the company 
those difficult market forces involved non defense markets which were down to more than from peak  an uncertain economic recovery and a likely sharp downturn in us defense spending beginning as early as the study culminated in the creation of the company s planned roadmap to deliver superior long term earnings growth and increased shareholder value over the next business cycle and beyond 
the company s roadmap  named move  requires aggressive cost reduction and prudent organic growth initiatives until a market recovery provides an opportunity for significant earnings leverage  estimated at levels approaching million of operating income to return to prior peak earnings  in its non defense markets 
the move strategy consists of four key strategic initiatives market recovery and growth the company believes that many of its non defense markets will begin to recover after fiscal the company plans to capture or improve its historic share of a market recovery 
optimize cost and capital structure the company plans to optimize its cost and capital structure to provide value for customers and shareholders by aggressively attacking its product  process and operating costs 
the expected savings and process improvement achieved are expected to enable the company to further reduce its debt 
value innovation the company plans to further strengthen its multi generational product plans  which incorporate its newest technologies and drive the company s ability to benefit its customers and the company s performance 
emerging market expansion the company plans to drive international growth in targeted geographies where it believes that there are significant opportunities for growth 
the company is in the early stages of implementing the required initiatives to support this new roadmap and expects that the roadmap will benefit the company and its shareholders in the years to come 
the company believes fiscal will continue to be a transitional period for the company as a result of the difficult market forces described above 
specifically  the company expects a continued rebound in sales to external customers in the access equipment segment  which the company believes will be more than offset by a significant sales mix shift in the defense segment toward an increased percentage of low margin fmtv sales as well as lower sales of higher margin m atvs and fhtvs 
as a result  the company expects that operating income and net income will be significantly lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal in mid july  the company was informed by the dod and its tire supplier that recent orders for military vehicles  including orders received by the company for m atv underbody improvement kits  may cause a constraint in the supply of a certain size and specification of tire 
the company uses these same tires on many of its heavy tactical vehicles 
since that time  insufficient supplier capacity to accommodate this spike in demand has caused the dod to use its sovereign authority to direct tires currently scheduled for delivery to the company for fhtv production to be re routed for use on contracts with the dx designation 
the dx designation process is essentially a process that enables the dod to prioritize use of materials for national defense purposes 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company began engaging in regular discussions with the dod and the tire supplier 
the company now expects that the tire shortage will negatively impact the timing of its production and delivery schedule through much of fiscal and will negatively impact the timing of its fhtv sales 
the company continues to assess the matter and is working to minimize any impact this situation may have on its operations and its results 
based on the most recent information received from the tire supplier and the dod  the company has removed approximately million of sales from its fiscal expectations communicated in its form q filed for its third quarter of fiscal revenue on these units is expected to move to fiscal the company expects it would be reimbursed by the dod for any additional costs that it incurs due to the re direction of these specialty tires 
the company expects that sales in its defense segment in fiscal will decline by approximately compared to fiscal the company also expects to experience a significant shift in sales mix with fmtv sales comprising approximately of segment sales in fiscal compared to approximately in fiscal in addition  the company expects lower aftermarket sales in fiscal as a significant amount of m atv related parts sales occurred in fiscal the company expects that operating income margins in the defense segment in fiscal will be below due in large part to the significant change in sales mix between and within the company s different defense programs 
the company does not expect the fmtv program to be profitable until the second quarter of fiscal  but it does expect that full year fmtv margins will be slightly above breakeven due to the reduction of start up costs  the in sourcing of work and the implementation of material cost reductions 

table of contents the company believes that the access equipment segment will experience sales growth of approximately in fiscal as compared to fiscal largely as a result of higher replacement demand in north america and in parts of europe and continued growth in emerging markets 
the company believes that operating income margins in the access equipment segment will be in the mid to upper single digit range as a percentage of sales in fiscal depending on the speed with which the company executes its cost reduction initiatives 
the higher material costs experienced in this segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal are expected to continue to impact the segment in fiscal  but the company expects recently announced price increases to offset much of the increased material costs beginning in the second fiscal quarter 
the company believes that fire emergency segment sales in fiscal will be flat compared to fiscal driven by continued weak municipal spending 
the company expects that fire emergency segment operating income margins will improve compared to fiscal to the low single digit range as it expects benefits from previously announced restructuring actions and reduced restructuring related costs 
the company believes that sales in the commercial segment will be slightly higher in fiscal compared to fiscal the company expects domestic concrete mixer sales will remain weak as a result of continued weakness in housing starts and other construction activity 
the company estimates that refuse collection vehicle sales in fiscal will be slightly higher compared with fiscal  but that sales in fiscal will be concentrated early in the fiscal year as customers purchase vehicles prior to the end of calendar  when a us bonus depreciation tax deduction is scheduled to expire 
the company expects that operating income margins in the commercial segment in fiscal will be approximately flat with fiscal the company expects that corporate expenses will be flat to slightly higher in fiscal compared to fiscal  in part to support new business initiatives to sustain long term growth 
the company expects modestly lower interest expense in fiscal due to lower debt levels and the expiration of an interest rate swap agreement in december the company believes that its fiscal effective income tax rate will approximate to 
the company believes that it will experience modestly negative free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures in fiscal the company expects that the cash usage will be largely driven by lower earnings  lower performance based payments from the us government as a result of an expected continued decline in defense segment sales  higher working capital requirements as sales to external customers continue to rebound in the access equipment segment  and anticipated capital expenditures in fiscal of million to million 
the company expects that fiscal will be its trough earnings year in this business cycle as it expects its move strategic initiatives will have greater impact on earnings in fiscal and as the global economy continues its slow recovery 
the company expects relatively strong performance in the defense segment in the first quarter of fiscal  driven by the expected sale of more than m atvs 
the company expects that seasonally weak sales and high material costs not yet offset by the recently announced price increase will impact access equipment results in the first quarter of fiscal the company expects lower sales and an operating loss in the fire emergency segment in the first quarter of fiscal  as it continues to improve efficiencies at its florida operations 
the company also expects relatively strong performance in the first quarter of fiscal in the commercial segment led by demand for refuse collection vehicles driven by the scheduled expiration of a us bonus depreciation tax deduction at the end of calendar the company believes fiscal first quarter earnings will approximate one fourth of its earnings for the full fiscal year  whereas the company typically experiences a seasonally weaker first quarter

the swap  which has a termination date of december   effectively fixes the libor based interest rate on the debt in the amount of the notional amount of the swap at plus the applicable spread based on the terms of the credit agreement at september  
the notional amount of the swap at september  was million

additionally  with certain exceptions  the credit agreement limits the ability of the company to pay dividends and other distributions 
however  so long as no event of default exists under the credit agreement or would result from such payment  the company may pay dividends and other distributions in an aggregate amount not exceeding the sum of i million during any fiscal year  plus ii the excess of a of the cumulative net income of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries for all fiscal quarters ending after september   over b the cumulative amount of all such dividends and other distributions made in any fiscal year ending after such date that exceed million  plus iii for each of the first four fiscal quarters ending after september   million per fiscal quarter  in each case provided that the leverage ratio as defined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter was less than to  plus iv for the period of four fiscal quarters ending september  and for each period of four fiscal quarters ending thereafter  million during such period  in each case provided that the leverage ratio as defined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter was less than to senior notes in march  the company issued million of unsecured senior notes due march  and million of unsecured senior notes due march  collectively  the senior notes

requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become firm until four weeks prior to the company s scheduled unit production 
the purchase obligations amount included above represents the value of commitments considered firm  plus the value of all outstanding subcontracts 
due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlement with taxing authorities  the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits for the remaining uncertain tax liabilities 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits as of september  have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above

table of contents critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue on equipment and parts sales when contract terms are met  collectability is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer 
revenue from service agreements is recognized as earned  when services have been rendered 
appropriate provisions are made for discounts  returns and sales allowances 
sales are recorded net of amounts invoiced for taxes imposed on the customer such as excise or value added taxes 
sales to the us government of non commercial products manufactured to the government s specifications are recognized using the units of delivery measure under the percentage of completion accounting method as units are accepted by the government 
the company includes amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
the company charges anticipated losses on contracts or programs in progress to earnings when identified 
approximately of the company s revenues for fiscal were recognized under the percentage of completion accounting method 
the company accounts for certain equipment lease contracts as sales type leases 
the present value of all payments  net of executory costs such as legal fees  is recorded as revenue  the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of sales  certain profit is deferred in accordance with lease accounting rules and interest income is recognized over the terms of the leases using the effective interest method 
the company enters into rental purchase guarantee agreements with some of its customers 
these agreements are normally for a term of no greater than twelve months and provide for rental payments with a guaranteed purchase at the end of the agreement 
at the inception of the agreement  the company records the full amount due under the agreement as revenue and the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of sales 
sales incentives 
the terms for sales transactions with some of the company s distributors and customers may include specific volume based incentives  which are calculated and paid or credited on account as a percentage of actual sales 
the company accounts for these incentives as sales discounts at the time of revenue recognition  which are recorded as a direct reduction of sales 
the company reviews its accrual for sales incentives on a quarterly basis and any adjustments are reflected in current earnings 
impairment of long lived and amortized intangible assets 
the company performs impairment evaluations of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the long lived assets  the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the company performs its annual review at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates  supplemented by the market approach 
estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or  under certain circumstances  a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business 
when estimated future discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the net assets and related goodwill  an impairment test is performed to measure and recognize the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
impairment losses  limited to the carrying value of goodwill  represent the excess of the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  the company considers current and projected future levels of income as well as business trends  prospects and market and economic conditions 

table of contents the company evaluates the recoverability of indefinite lived trade names  based upon a relief from royalty method 
this methodology determines the fair value of each trade name through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate the company would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular trade name 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  the company considers projected future sales  a fair market royalty rate for each applicable trade name and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
such events may include  but are not limited to  the impact of the economic environment  a material negative change in relationships with significant customers  or strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions 
see critical accounting estimates 
guarantees of the indebtedness of others 
the company enters into agreements with finance companies whereby the company will guarantee the indebtedness of third party end users to whom the finance company lends to purchase the company s equipment 
in some instances  the company retains an obligation to the finance companies in the event the customer defaults on the financing 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  guarantees  the company recognizes the greater of the fair value of the guarantee or the contingent liability required by fasb asc topic  contingencies 
reserves are initially established related to these guarantees at the fair value of the guarantee based upon the company s understanding of the current financial position of the underlying customers and based on estimates and judgments made from information available at that time 
if the company becomes aware of deterioration in the financial condition of the customer borrower or of any impairment of the customer borrower s ability to make payments  additional allowances are considered 
although the company may be liable for the entire amount of a customer borrower s financial obligation under guarantees  its losses would generally be mitigated by the value of any underlying collateral including financed equipment  the finance company s inability to provide clear title of foreclosed equipment to the company  loss pools established in accordance with the agreements and other conditions 
during periods of economic downturn  the value of the underlying collateral supporting these guarantees can decline sharply to further increase losses in the event of a customer borrower s default 
critical accounting estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management of the company has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosures relating to such estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
definitization of undefinitized contracts 
the company recognizes revenue on undefinitized contracts to the extent that it can reasonably and reliably estimate the expected final contract price and when collectability is reasonably assured 
to the extent that contract definitization results in changes to previously estimated costs or revenues  the company records those adjustments as a change in estimate 
the company updated its estimated costs under several undefinitized change orders related to m atvs and recorded million related to such updates during fiscal as all costs associated with these contracts had been previously expensed  the change increased net income by million or per share 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management to estimate a customer s ability to satisfy its obligations 
the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is particularly critical in the company s access equipment segment where the majority of the company s trade receivables are recorded 
the company evaluates the collectability of receivables based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
additional reserves are established based upon the company s perception of the quality of the current receivables  including the length of time the receivables are past due  past experience of collectability and underlying economic conditions 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional reserves would be required 

table of contents goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill  it is necessary to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
the estimate of fair value of the reporting units is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows supplemented by the market approach 
in estimating the fair value  management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows  future revenues  future earnings and other factors 
the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans 
such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
the rate used to discount estimated cash flows is a rate corresponding to the company s cost of capital  adjusted for risk where appropriate  and is dependent upon interest rates at a point in time 
the company weighted the income approach more heavily as the income approach uses long term estimates that consider the expected operating profit of each reporting unit during periods where residential and non residential construction and other macroeconomic indicators are nearer historical averages 
the company believes the income approach more accurately considers the expected recovery in the us and european construction markets than the market approach 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
it is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner to cause further impairment of goodwill  which could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
at july   approximately of the company s recorded goodwill and purchased intangibles were concentrated within the jlg reporting unit in the access equipment segment 
the estimated fair value of jlg calculated in the fourth quarter of fiscal impairment analysis exceeded jlg s net book value by approximately  or million 
the impairment model assumes that the us economy and construction spending and hence access equipment demand will improve beginning in fiscal assumptions utilized in the impairment analysis are highly judgmental  especially given the severity and global scale of the current economic uncertainty 
changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could have produced significantly different results 
for each additional basis point increase in the discount rate  the fair value of jlg would decrease by approximately million 
events and conditions that could result in the impairment of intangibles at jlg include a further decline in economic conditions  a slower or weaker economic recovery than currently estimated by the company or other factors leading to reductions in expected long term sales or profitability at jlg 
the company has no other reporting units that have material amounts of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets that are at risk of impairment 
loss contracts 
during fiscal  the company incurred ramp up costs of million on production of fmtvs which resulted in costs in excess of revenues under the fmtv contract during each quarter of the fiscal year 
the company expects to continue to incur costs in excess of revenues on the fmtv contract through the first quarter of fiscal  although at amounts lower than in fiscal the company expects that fmtv program revenues for production beyond september  on orders received to date will exceed expected costs and  therefore  has not recorded a charge for a loss contract 
in evaluating the profitability under the fmtv contract  it is necessary to estimate future material and production costs 
management cost assumptions include estimates for future increases in the costs of materials  reductions in ramp up costs  targeted cost savings and production efficiencies 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these estimates 
small changes in estimates can have a significant impact on profitability under the contract 
for example  an additional escalation in material costs above the company s estimates would increase the cost of materials by approximately million 
although this amount is less than the expected future profitability  it would significantly reduce the expected future gross margins on orders currently in backlog 
it is possible that other assumptions underlying the analysis could change in such a manner that the company would determine in the future that this is a loss contract  which could result in a material charge to earnings 
guarantees of the indebtedness of others 
the reserve for guarantees of the indebtedness of others requires management to estimate a customer s ability to satisfy its obligations 
the estimate is particularly critical in the company s access equipment segment where the majority of the company s guarantees are granted 
the company evaluates the reserve based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is recorded in accordance with fasb asc topic  contingencies 
in most cases  the financing company is required to provide clear title to the equipment under the financing program 
the company considers the residual value of the equipment to reduce the amount of exposure 
residual values are estimated based upon recent auctions  used equipment sales and periodic studies performed by a third party 
additional reserves  based upon historical loss percentages  are established at the time of sale of the equipment based upon the requirement of asc topic  guarantees 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional reserves would be required 

table of contents product liability 
due to the nature of the company s products  the company is subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business 
a substantial portion of these claims and lawsuits involve the company s access equipment  concrete placement and refuse collection vehicle businesses  while such lawsuits in the company s defense and fire emergency businesses have historically been limited 
to the extent permitted under applicable law  the company maintains insurance to reduce or eliminate risk to the company 
most insurance coverage includes self insured retentions that vary by business segment and by year 
as of september   the company was generally self insured for future claims up to million per claim 
the company establishes product liability reserves for its self insured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and the company s ability to reasonably estimate such loss 
there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation 
the company makes estimates based on available information and the company s best judgment after consultation with appropriate experts 
the company periodically revises estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances 
the company also utilizes actuarial methodologies to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of the adverse development of claims over time 
warranty 
sales of the company s products generally carry typical explicit manufacturers warranties based on terms that are generally accepted in the company s marketplaces 
the company records provisions for estimated warranty and other related costs at the time of sale based on historical warranty loss experience and periodically adjusts these provisions to reflect actual experience 
certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
at times  warranty issues arise that are beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
the company provides for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable 
it is reasonably possible that from time to time additional warranty and other related claims could arise from disputes or other matters beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
the company s products generally carry explicit warranties that extend from six months to five years  based on terms that are generally accepted in the marketplace 
selected components included in the company s end products such as engines  transmissions  tires  etc 
may include manufacturers warranties 
these manufacturers warranties are generally passed on to the end customer of the company s products and the customer would generally deal directly with the component manufacturer 
the company s policy is to record a liability for the expected cost of warranty related claims at the time of the sale 
the amount of warranty liability accrued reflects management s best estimate of the expected future cost of honoring the company s obligations under the warranty plans 
the company believes that the warranty accounting estimate is a critical accounting estimate because changes in the warranty provision can materially affect net income  the estimate requires management to forecast estimated product usage levels by customers  in the case of new models  components or technology may be different  resulting in higher levels of warranty claims experience than with existing  mature products  and certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
the estimate for warranty obligations is a critical accounting estimate for each of the company s operating segments 
historically  the cost of fulfilling the company s warranty obligations has principally involved replacement parts  labor and sometimes travel for any field retrofit campaigns 
over the past three fiscal years  the company s warranty cost as a percentage of sales has ranged from of sales to of sales 
warranty costs tend to be higher shortly after new product introductions  especially those introductions involving new technologies  when field warranty campaigns may be necessary to correct or retrofit certain items 
accordingly  the company must make assumptions about the number and cost of anticipated field warranty campaigns 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience  the extent of pre production testing  the number of units involved and the extent of new features components included in new product models 
each quarter  the company reviews actual warranty claims experience to determine if there are any systemic defects that would require a field campaign 
also  based upon historical experience  warranty provision rates on new product introductions are established at higher than standard rates to reflect increased expected warranty costs associated with any new product introduction 

table of contents at times  warranty issues can arise which are beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
if the estimate of warranty costs in fiscal increased or decreased by basis points  the company s accrued warranty costs  costs of sales and operating income would each change by million or  and  respectively 
benefit plans 
the pension benefit obligation and related pension income are calculated in accordance with asc topic  compensation retirement benefits  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
the company s benefit plan assumptions are determined by using a benchmark approach as well as currently available actuarial data 
these rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance 
actuarial valuations at september  used a weighted average discount rate of and an expected return on plan assets of 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase annual pension expense by million 
a decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the company s annual pension expense by million 
the company s other postretirement benefits obligation and related expenses are calculated in accordance asc topic  compensation retirement benefits  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including health care trend rates 
an increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and would increase the annual service and interest cost by million 
a corresponding decrease of one percentage point would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and decrease the annual service and interest cost by million 
income taxes 
the company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the related net assets 
the company records a valuation allowance  when appropriate  to adjust deferred tax asset balances to the amount management expects to realize 
management considers  as applicable  the amount of taxable income available in carryback years  future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
the company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb asc topic  income taxes 
asc topic prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
asc topic also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  disclosure and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with asc topic is a two step process 
the first step is recognition  where the company evaluates whether an individual tax position has a likelihood of greater than of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are currently estimated to have a less than likelihood of being sustained  zero tax benefit is recorded 
for tax positions that have met the recognition threshold in the first step  the company performs the second step of measuring the benefit to be recorded 
the actual benefits ultimately realized may differ from the company s estimates 
in future periods  changes in facts and circumstances and new information may require the company to change the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to individual tax positions 
changes in recognition and measurement estimates are recorded in results of operations and financial position in the period in which such changes occur 
as of september   the company had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to uncertain tax positions totaling million 
new accounting standards refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting standards on the company s consolidated financial statements 
customers and backlog sales to the us government comprised approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal no other single customer accounted for more than of the company s net sales for this period 
a substantial majority of the company s net sales are derived from customer orders prior to commencing production 

table of contents the company s backlog as of september  increased to billion compared to billion at september  defense segment backlog increased to billion at september  compared to billion at september  due largely to additional delivery orders received under the fmtv contract  offset in part by the fulfillment of orders received for vehicles related to the fhtv program 
access equipment segment backlog increased to million at september  compared to million at september  backlog increased in all access equipment product categories as demand rebounded from historical lows and large rental companies accelerated orders in anticipation of capacity constraints in access equipment backlog as of september  and included million and million  respectively  relating to telehandler orders from the dod 
fire emergency segment backlog increased to million at september  compared to million at september  due largely to strong broadcast equipment orders 
commercial segment backlog increased to million at september  compared to million at september  unit backlog for concrete mixers was up compared to very low backlog at september   primarily as a result of increased international orders 
unit backlog for refuse collection vehicles was up compared to september  in large part due to the timing of orders to benefit from a bonus depreciation tax deduction under the us tax code which expires on december  reported backlog excludes purchase options and announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed 
additionally  backlog excludes unfunded portions of the fhtv  mtvr  m atv  lvsr and fmtv contracts 
backlog information and comparisons thereof as of different dates may not be accurate indicators of future sales or the ratio of the company s future sales to the dod versus its sales to other customers 
approximately of the company s september  backlog is not expected to be filled in fiscal financial market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  certain commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
to reduce the risk from changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates  the company selectively uses financial instruments 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
the company s earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to short term market interest rates 
the company  as needed  uses interest rate swaps to modify its exposure to interest rate movements 
in january  the company entered into an interest rate swap to reduce the risk of interest rate changes associated with the company s variable rate debt issued to finance the acquisition of jlg 
the swap effectively fixes the variable portion of the interest rate on debt in the amount of the notional amount of the swap at plus the applicable spread based on the terms of the credit agreement 
the notional amount of the swap at september  was million 
the swap terminates on december  the portion of the company s interest expense not effectively fixed in the interest rate swap remains sensitive to changes in the interest rates in the us and off shore markets 
in this regard  changes in us and off shore interest rates affect interest payable on the company s borrowings under its credit agreement 
based on debt outstanding at september   a basis point increase or decrease in the average cost of the company s variable rate debt  including outstanding swaps  would increase or decrease annual pre tax interest expense by approximately million 

table of contents the table below provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations dollars in millions expected maturity date fair thereafter total value liabilities long term debt variable rate us average interest rate fixed rate us average interest rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps variable to fixed us average pay rate average receive rate for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
commodity price risk 
the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  including steel  aluminum and composites 
in addition  the company is a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities  including steel  aluminum  rubber and others which are integrated into the company s end products 
the company generally buys these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process 
the company does not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
the company generally obtains firm quotations from its suppliers for a significant portion of its orders under firm  fixed price contracts in its defense segment 
in the company s access equipment  fire emergency and commercial segments  the company generally attempts to obtain firm pricing from most of its suppliers  consistent with backlog requirements and or forecasted annual sales 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing from its suppliers  or its suppliers are not able to honor such prices  then the company may experience margin declines to the extent it is not able to increase selling prices of its products 
foreign currency risk 
the company s operations consist of manufacturing in the us  belgium  canada  the netherlands  france  australia  romania and china and sales and limited vehicle body mounting activities on six continents 
in addition  the company manufactures products through investments in joint ventures in mexico and brazil 
international sales comprised approximately of overall net sales in fiscal  including approximately that involved export sales from the us the majority of export sales in fiscal were denominated in us dollars 
as a result of the manufacture and sale of the company s products in foreign markets  the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar  as compared to foreign currencies in which certain of the company s transactions in foreign markets are denominated 
the company s operating results are principally exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the european currencies  primarily the euro and the uk pound sterling  changes between the uk dollar and the australian dollar  changes between the us dollar and the brazilian real and changes between the us dollar and the chinese renminbi 
through the company s foreign currency hedging activities  the company seeks to minimize the risk that cash flows resulting from the sales of the company s products will be affected by changes in exchange rates 
the company enters into certain forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the company s foreign currency exchange risk 
these contracts qualify as derivative instruments under fasb asc topic  derivatives and hedging  however  the company has not designated all of these instruments as hedge transactions under asc topic accordingly  the mark to market impact of these derivatives is recorded each period to current earnings along with the offsetting foreign currency transaction gain loss recognized on the related balance sheet exposure 
at september   
table of contents the company was managing million notional of foreign currency contracts  none of which were designated as accounting hedges and all of which settle within days 
the following table quantifies outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge non us dollar denominated cash  receivables and payables and the corresponding impact on the value of these instruments assuming a appreciation depreciation of the us dollar relative to all other currencies on september  dollars in millions foreign exchange gain loss from notional amount average contractual exchange rate fair value appreciation of us dollar depreciation of us dollar sell euro buy usd sell aud buy usd sell gbp buy usd sell gbp buy euro as previously noted  the company s policy prohibits the trading of financial instruments for speculative purposes or the use of leveraged instruments 
it is important to note that gains and losses indicated in the sensitivity analysis would be offset by gains and losses on the underlying receivables and payables
