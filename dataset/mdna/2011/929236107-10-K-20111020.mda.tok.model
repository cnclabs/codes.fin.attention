table of contents sales of multi purpose maintenance products in the americas segment decreased million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
this sales decrease was primarily driven by lower sales of wd products in the us  which were down for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to reduced product offerings and lost promotional opportunities with certain of our key customers 
these decreased sales of wd products in the us were partially offset by higher sales of these same products in latin america and in canada  which were both up by primarily due to new distribution  a higher level of replenishment orders and increased promotional activities from period to period 
sales of homecare and cleaning products in the americas segment decreased million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
although we remain focused on stabilizing the sales of our homecare and cleaning products  sales of these products continue to be negatively impacted by competition  category declines  lost distribution and reduced product offerings 
in addition  sales of such products have been negatively impacted by the volatility of orders from and the level of promotional programs with certain customers  particularly those in the warehouse club and mass retail channels 
sales of homecare and cleaning products in the us  which is where the majority of such sales originate  decreased from period to period 
this sales decrease was driven primarily by lower sales of spot shot products  which were down in the us for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
this decrease in spot shot sales was due to several factors  including reduced promotional opportunities with our customers  specifically those within the warehouse club channel  category declines  lost distribution and the effect of competitive factors 
sales of our automatic toilet bowl cleaners in the americas segment also decreased million  or  from period to period due to competitive factors  category declines and lost distribution 
also contributing to the overall decline in sales of the homecare and cleaning products in the americas segment was a decrease in the sales of our carpet fresh and x brands  which totaled million  or  and was primarily due to a lower level of product offerings carried by certain of our customers and the effect of competitive factors

we experienced sales growth throughout the europe segment for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year  with percentage increases in sales as follows italy   uk   france   germanics sales region   and iberia  
the sales growth in the direct markets throughout the europe segment was primarily due to new distribution  the continued growth of the wd smart straw and in one products and our increased focus on the industrial channel 
in addition  sales in the direct markets were favorably impacted by the ongoing growth of our base business  increased volumes through existing distribution channels and a higher level of promotional activities

gross profit gross profit increased to million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to for the fiscal year ended august  compared to for the prior fiscal year due to a variety of items which partially offset each other  including costs associated with petroleum based materials and aerosol cans  other raw materials and manufacturing costs  sales mix changes  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  sales price increases and the level of discounts offered to our customers 
gross margin was negatively impacted by percentage points due to the combined effects of changes in the costs of petroleum based materials and aerosol cans from period to period 
there is often a delay of one quarter or more before changes in such raw material costs impact cost of products sold due to production and inventory life cycles 
as a result of an aerosol can price increase that our suppliers implemented in january and the increase in the costs associated with petroleum based materials which started in the second quarter of our fiscal year  our gross margin from period to period was negatively impacted 
we expect that petroleum based material costs will continue to be volatile and that volatility will have an impact on our cost of products sold in future periods 
in addition to increased costs associated with petroleum based materials and aerosol cans  we also experienced higher costs associated with other raw materials and manufacturing costs  largely related to our europe segment  which negatively impacted gross margin by percentage points from period to period 
sales mix changes negatively impacted gross margin by percentage points for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
in addition  changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted gross margin by percentage points 
partially offsetting the aforementioned unfavorable impacts to gross margin were sales price increases and a lower level of advertising  promotional and other discounts offered to our customers from period to period 
sales price increases implemented in certain locations and markets during fiscal year positively affected gross margin by percentage points 
advertising  promotional and other discounts decreased during the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year positively impacting gross margin by percentage points 
the decrease in such discounts was due to the fact that a lower percentage of sales during fiscal year was subject to promotional allowances compared to the prior fiscal year 
in general  the timing of advertising  promotional and other discounts  which are recorded as a reduction to sales may cause fluctuations in gross margin from period to period 
examples of advertising  promotional and other discounts include coupon redemptions  consideration and allowances given to retailers for space and or favorable display positions in their stores  co operative advertising and promotional activity  volume discounts and other one time or ongoing incentives 
in addition  other miscellaneous items when combined positively impacted gross margin by percentage points from period to period 
note that our gross profits and gross margins may not be comparable to those of other reporting entities  since some entities include all costs related to distribution of their products in cost of products sold  whereas we exclude the portion associated with amounts paid to third parties for distribution to our customers from our contract packagers and include these costs in selling  general and administrative expenses 
these costs totaled million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses remained constant at million for the fiscal years ended august  and as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses decreased to for the fiscal year ended august  from for the prior fiscal year 
although total sg a expenses remained constant year over year  various components within sg a expenses increased for the fiscal year ended 
table of contents august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
these increases in sg a expenses were largely attributable to higher professional services costs  increased freight costs  a higher level of expenses associated with travel and meetings  increased office overhead costs and the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
professional services costs increased million due to higher legal and consulting fees 
freight costs increased million primarily due to increased diesel costs and higher sales volumes for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
travel and meeting expenses increased million due to a higher level of travel expenses associated with the ongoing support of our strategic initiatives 
office overhead expenses increased million primarily due to repairs required at our memphis warehouse facility 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased sg a expenses by million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
other miscellaneous expenses  which primarily include broker sales commissions and bad debt expense increased by million period over period 
the increases in sg a expenses described above were fully offset by lower employee related costs from period to period 
employee related costs  which include salaries  bonuses  profit sharing  stock based compensation and other fringe benefits  decreased million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to lower bonus expense 
in fiscal year  certain of our business segments did not achieve the sales and other profit performance metrics required to trigger payout of bonuses 
as a result  bonus expense and the related fringe benefit expense decreased million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
this decrease in bonus expense from period to period was slightly offset by a million increase in employee related costs as a result of increased staffing levels in fiscal year and the annual compensation increases  which were implemented in the first quarter of the current fiscal year and not in the prior fiscal year 
we continued our research and development investment in support of our focus on innovation and renovation of our products 
research and development costs for the fiscal years ended august  and were million and million  respectively

advertising and sales promotion expenses advertising and sales promotion expenses for the fiscal year ended august  increased million  or  to million from million for the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased to for the fiscal year ended august  from for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in advertising and sales promotion expenses was due to a higher level of advertising and promotional activities period over period  primarily in our europe and asia pacific segments 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of million on advertising and sales promotion expenses for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
thus  on a constant currency basis  advertising and sales promotion expenses for the fiscal year ended august  would have been million resulting in an increase in such expenses of million period over period 
investment in global advertising and sales promotion expenses for fiscal year is expected to be in the range of to of net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  advertising and sales promotion expenses may fluctuate period to period based upon the type of marketing activities we employ and the period in which the costs are incurred 
the costs of certain promotional activities are required to be recorded as a reduction to sales  while others are recorded as advertising and sales promotion expenses 
total promotional costs recorded as a reduction to sales were million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and therefore  our total investment in advertising and sales promotion activities totaled million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 

table of contents amortization of definite lived intangible assets expense amortization of our definite lived intangible assets was million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
the increase in amortization for the fiscal year ended august  was related to the flushes  spot shot and trade names which were changed to definite lived intangible assets from indefinite lived intangible assets at february  the amortization for the fiscal year ended august  related only to the carpet fresh and x trade names and certain non contractual customer relationships from the acquisition of the line of products in fiscal year beginning march   the trade name is being amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life of twenty years  and the flushes and spot shot trade names are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of seventeen years 
the non contractual customer relationships intangible asset and the trade name are recorded and amortized in pounds sterling and are converted to us dollars for reporting purposes

however  this increase was more than offset by the decrease in sales of all other homecare and cleaning product brands in the americas segment 
the largest decline came from the automatic toilet bowl cleaners which decreased million  or  for fiscal year compared to fiscal year due primarily to the effect of competitive factors and declining categories which was partially offset by new distribution outside of the grocery channel

the decrease in such discounts was due to the fact that a lower percentage of sales during fiscal year was subject to promotional allowances compared to fiscal year in addition  sales mix favorably impacted gross margin by percentage points

we target our gross margin to be at or above of net sales  our cost of doing business to be at or below of net sales  and our ebitda to be at or above of net sales 
although our results for these performance measures may vary from period to period depending on various factors  including economic conditions and our level of investment in activities for the future  we continue to focus on and work towards achievement of our targets over the long term 

table of contents the following table summarizes the results of these performance measures fiscal year ended august  gross margin cost of doing business as a percentage of net sales ebitda as a percentage of net sales we use the performance measures above to establish financial goals and to gain an understanding of the comparative performance of the company from period to period 
we believe that these measures provide our shareholders with additional insights into the company s results of operations and how we run our business 
the non gaap financial measures are supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income  income from operations or other financial information prepared in accordance with gaap as indicators of the company s performance or operations 
reconciliations of these non gaap financial measures to our financial statements as prepared in accordance with gaap are as follows cost of doing business in thousands  except percentages fiscal year ended august  total operating expenses gaap amortization of definite lived intangible assets impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets depreciation in operating departments cost of doing business net sales    b cost of doing business as a percentage of net sales ebitda in thousands  except percentages fiscal year ended august  net income gaap provision for income taxes interest income interest expense amortization of definite lived intangible assets depreciation ebitda net sales ebitda as a percentage of net sales liquidity and capital resources overview the company s financial condition and liquidity remain strong 
net cash provided by operations was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year we believe we continue to be well positioned to weather any uncertainty in the capital markets and global economy due to our strong balance sheet and efficient business model  along with our growing and diversified global revenues 
we continue to manage all aspects of our business including  but not limited to  monitoring the financial health of our customers  suppliers and other third party relationships  implementing gross margin enhancement strategies and developing new opportunities for growth 

table of contents our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations and cash available from our revolving credit facility 
previously  we had a revolving credit facility with union bank  na in the amount of million  which was terminated effective on june  when we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility with bank of america  na bank of america 
our available cash funds have increased significantly under this credit facility with bank of america 
the outstanding indebtedness under our original million  fixed rate term loan was million as of august  the final payment on this term loan is due in october see note subsequent events in item of this report for details on this final payment 
we plan to use the proceeds of the revolving credit facility with bank of america for our share repurchases and general working capital needs 
in july  we drew million under the revolving credit facility with bank of america 
we repaid this million short term loan and the associated interest with cash on hand in august thus  there was no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility as of august  until the time at which the million term note is paid in full  the revolving credit facility is subject to the same debt covenants as the term loan agreement 
the term loan agreement has covenant requirements  which require us to maintain minimum consolidated net worth greater than the sum of million plus of consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter beginning with the first fiscal quarter of  plus proceeds of all equity securities other than those issued under our prior stock option plan and current stock incentive plan 
a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio in the range of to on the last day of any fiscal quarter must be maintained 
the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and rent expense minus cash payments for income taxes and capital expenditure by total cash payments for rent  principal and interest 
we are also limited to a leverage ratio ranging from to  which is calculated by dividing total debt by earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  measured on a trailing four quarter basis at each reporting period 
once the term loan agreement is paid in full  the bank of america agreement requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization of million  measured on a trailing twelve month basis  at each reporting period 
at august   we were in compliance with all debt covenants as required by the term loan agreement and the revolving credit facility and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 
at august   we had a total of million in cash and cash equivalents 
of this balance  million was held in europe  australia and china in foreign currencies 
it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings at these locations in order to ensure sufficient working capital  expand operations and fund foreign acquisitions in these locations 
we believe that our future cash from domestic operations together with our access to funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility will provide adequate resources to fund both short term and long term operating requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions and new business development activities in the united states 
in the event that management elects in the future to repatriate some or all of the foreign earnings that were previously deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states  we would incur additional tax expense upon such repatriation 
we believe that these existing consolidated cash and cash equivalents at august   the liquidity provided by our million revolving credit facility and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we consider various factors when reviewing liquidity needs and plans for available cash on hand including future debt  principal and interest payments  early debt repayment penalties  future capital expenditure requirements  share repurchases  future dividend payments which are determined on a quarterly basis by the company s board of directors  alternative investment opportunities  debt covenants and any other relevant considerations currently facing our business 

table of contents cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows by category for the periods presented in thousands fiscal year ended august  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year cash provided by operating activities decreased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to changes in operating assets and liabilities  primarily changes in trade accounts receivable  accrued payroll and related expenses  inventories  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
trade accounts receivable increased primarily due to higher sales volumes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared to the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
accrued payroll and related expenses decreased from year to year primarily due to the payment of fiscal year bonuses during the first quarter of fiscal year which were significantly higher than those paid in the prior fiscal year and lower bonus accruals for the current fiscal year 
inventories increased due to additional purchases in support of the wd specialist line  which was launched in september  and promotions in the upcoming quarters 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased from year to year due primarily to the increase in accounts payable balances resulting from increased business activities and the timing of payments 
also contributing to the overall change in cash provided by operating activities was the impact of changes in various account balances related to income taxes from period to period as a result of the year end provision for income taxes 
these entries resulted in changes to account balances for other assets  deferred tax assets and liabilities  income taxes payable and deferred and other long term liabilities 
see note income taxes included in item of this report for additional details 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year cash provided by operating activities increased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to an increase in net income and changes in assets and liabilities  primarily changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  accrued payroll and related expenses  deferred and other long term liabilities and income taxes payable 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased significantly from year to year due primarily to the increase in accounts payable balances resulting from increased business activities and the timing of payments 
accrued payroll and related expenses increased from year to year due to a higher level of bonus accruals recorded during fiscal year compared to fiscal year and the timing of payments for both the bonus and profit sharing plans 
bonus accruals were higher during fiscal year as most regions met or exceeded sales and other profit performance targets in fiscal year whereas achievement of such targets were unusually low in fiscal year deferred and other long term liabilities increased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to an increase in long term income taxes payable related to uncertain tax positions 
partially offsetting these increases from year to year was a decrease in income taxes payable due to the timing of payments as compared to income tax accruals and the final year end tax provision entries 
investing activities net cash used for investing activities increased million to million for the fiscal year from million for fiscal year due primarily to higher purchases of property and equipment 
purchases of property 
table of contents and equipment during fiscal year were primarily for machinery and equipment  computer equipment and software 
also contributing to the increase in net cash used for investing activities was the purchase of million in short term investments during fiscal year net cash used in investing activities decreased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year due primarily to lower purchases of property and equipment 
purchases of property and equipment during fiscal year were primarily for machinery and equipment to enhance manufacturing efficiencies  computer equipment and software 
purchases of property and equipment for fiscal year were higher primarily due to an increased level of purchases of machinery and equipment in support of manufacturing activities  particularly those related to smart straw 
financing activities net cash used for financing activities increased million to million for the fiscal year from million for fiscal year due primarily to million of treasury stock purchases which were transacted during the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal year the treasury stock purchases were partially offset by an increase of million from period to period in proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options 
net cash used in financing activities decreased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year due primarily to higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options from period to period 
effect of exchange rate changes all of our foreign subsidiaries currently operate in currencies other than the us dollar and a significant portion of our consolidated cash balances are denominated in these foreign currencies  particularly at our uk subsidiary which operates in pound sterling 
as a result  our cash and cash equivalents balances are subject to the effects of the fluctuations in these currencies against the us dollar at the end of each reporting period 
the net effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents  when expressed in us dollar terms  was an increase in cash of million for fiscal year  a decrease of million for fiscal year  and a decrease of million for fiscal year these changes from period to period are primarily due to the significant fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates for the pound sterling against the us dollar 
the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate increased from to during fiscal year  decreased from to during fiscal year and decreased from to during fiscal year share repurchase plans on december   the company s board of directors approved a share buy back plan 
under the plan  which was in effect for up to twelve months from the date of approval  the company was authorized to acquire up to million of our outstanding shares 
the company did not purchase any shares under this share buy back plan 
on december   the company s board of directors approved a share buy back plan  which was to be in effect through december   and authorized the company to acquire up to million of its outstanding shares 
on april   the company s board of directors approved an increase to this existing million share buy back plan to authorize the company to acquire an additional million of its outstanding shares and to extend the expiration date of the plan to april  as a result  the company is authorized to acquire shares of its common stock in the aggregate amount of million  less the amount utilized to date 
under the plan  the company is authorized to acquire its outstanding shares on such terms and conditions as may be acceptable to the company s chief executive officer or chief financial officer and subject to lender approval from prudential capital and in compliance with all laws and regulations applicable thereto 
during the period from december  through august   the company repurchased  shares at a total cost of million 

table of contents dividends the company has historically paid regular quarterly cash dividends on its common stock 
on october   the company s board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share payable on october  to shareholders of record on october  our ability to pay dividends could be affected by future business performance  liquidity  capital needs  alternative investment opportunities and debt covenants 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item a ii of regulation s k 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of minimum contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations and commitments as of august  for the next five years and thereafter in thousands 
future events could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts 
total year years years thereafter term loan interest payments on term loan operating leases supplemental employee retirement plan benefits obligation total represents commitments to certain retired key executives under the company s supplemental employee retirement plan 
the present value of all future benefit payments was million as of august  see note other benefit plans included in item of this report for additional details 
the following summarizes other commitments which are excluded from the contractual obligations table above as of august  we have relationships with various suppliers contract manufacturers who manufacture our products 
although we typically do not have definitive minimum purchase obligations included in the contract terms with the contract manufacturers  when such obligations have been included  they have been immaterial to date 
supply needs are communicated by us to our contract manufacturers  and we are committed to purchase the products produced based on orders and short term projections  ranging from two to five months  provided to the contract manufacturers 
we are also obligated to purchase obsolete or slow moving inventory from our contract manufacturers and have done so in the past under these commitments  the amounts of which have been immaterial 
under the terms of the credit facility agreement with bank of america  we may borrow funds in us dollars or in foreign currencies from time to time during the three year period commencing june  through june  based on our most recent cash projection  we expect to borrow amounts against this credit facility ranging from million to million in fiscal year we estimate that the interest associated with these borrowings will be approximately million for fiscal year based on the applicable interest rates and the expected payment dates of such borrowings 
at august   the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions  excluding associated interest and penalties  was approximately million 
we have estimated that up to million of unrecognized tax benefits related to income tax positions may be affected by the resolution of tax examinations or expiring statutes of limitation within the next twelve months 

table of contents critical accounting policies our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in our consolidated financial statements  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we use historical experience and other relevant factors when developing estimates and assumptions and these estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated 
note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report includes a discussion of significant accounting policies 
the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider to be most critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment 
our financial results may have varied from those reported had different assumptions been used or other conditions prevailed 
our critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition and sales incentives sales are recognized as revenue at the time of delivery to the customer when risks of loss and title have passed 
sales are recorded net of allowances for damaged goods and other sales returns  sales incentives  trade promotions and cash discounts 
we must make judgments and certain assumptions in order to determine when delivery has occurred 
through an analysis of end of period shipments  we determine an average time of transit of product to our customers  and this is used to estimate the time of delivery 
differences in judgments or estimates related to the lengthening or shortening of the estimated delivery time used could result in material differences in the timing of revenue recognition 
sales incentives are also recorded as a reduction of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
sales incentives include on going trade promotion programs with customers and consumer coupon programs that require us to estimate and accrue the expected costs of such programs 
these programs include cooperative marketing programs  shelf price reductions  coupons  rebates  consideration and allowances given to retailers for shelf space and or favorable display positions in their stores and other promotional activities 
costs related to these sales incentive programs  with the exception of coupon costs  are recorded as a reduction to sales upon delivery of products to customers 
coupon costs are based upon historical redemption rates and are recorded as a reduction to sales as incurred  which is when the coupons are circulated 
sales incentives are calculated based primarily on historical rates and consideration of recent promotional activities 
the determination of sales incentive costs and the related liabilities require us to use judgment for estimates that include current and past trade promotion spending patterns  status of trade promotion activities and the interpretation of historical spending trends by customer and category 
we review our assumptions and adjust our reserves accordingly on a quarterly basis 
our consolidated financial statements could be materially impacted if the actual promotion rates are different from the estimated rates 
if our accrual estimates for sales incentives at august  were to differ by  the impact on net sales would be approximately million 
allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions related to the collectability of our accounts receivable balances 
we specifically analyze historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we review our accounts receivable balances and our assumptions used to determine their collectability on a periodic basis and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly on a quarterly basis 

table of contents accounting for income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax liability or asset is established for the expected future tax consequences resulting from the differences in financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in addition to valuation allowances  we provide for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards prescribed by the authoritative guidance on income taxes 
amounts for uncertain tax positions are adjusted in periods when new information becomes available or when positions are effectively settled 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
us federal income tax expense is provided on remittances of foreign earnings and on unremitted foreign earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested 
us federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes are not provided when foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested 
we determine whether our foreign subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely based on the capital needs of the foreign subsidiaries 
we reassess this determination each reporting period 
changes to this determination may be warranted based on our experience as well as plans regarding future international operations and expected remittances 
valuation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment in accordance with the authoritative guidance on goodwill  intangibles and other 
we assess possible impairments to goodwill and existing indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually during our second fiscal quarter and otherwise when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment condition may exist 
in addition  indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
in performing the annual impairment test of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we consider the fair value concepts of a market participant and the highest and best use for our intangible assets 
goodwill we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level based on a two step process which is conducted by applying fair value concepts 
first  the book value of our net assets is compared to the fair value of the net assets of the reporting units that have goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment 
in the second step  the implied fair value of goodwill is estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step less the fair values of all other net tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
any required impairment losses are recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount of the related asset and charged to results of operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill 
based on the results of this test  we determined that our goodwill was not impaired since the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than as of february  during our impairment tests performed in fiscal years and  we also did not identify or record any impairment losses related to our goodwill 
indefinite lived intangible assets we test for impairment of our existing indefinite lived intangible assets based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgment and estimates with respect to  among other 
table of contents considerations  forecasted sales revenue  advertising and promotional expenses  cost of products sold  gross margins  operating margins  the success of product innovations and introductions  customer retention  tax rates  terminal growth values and the selection of appropriate discount and royalty rates 
for our existing indefinite lived intangible assets  an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount and is measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we conducted the annual impairment test for our indefinite lived intangible assets  which included the flushes  spot shot and trade names 
all three of these trade names generate their own revenue streams and the revenues for each are in no way dependent on the revenue streams of any of the other trade names 
based on the results of this annual impairment test  we determined that none of these intangible assets were impaired as of february  in conjunction with the annual impairment test that was conducted in the second quarter of fiscal year  we also performed an evaluation of our indefinite lived intangible assets to determine whether an indefinite life for each trade name was still warranted as of february  as a result of this evaluation  we determined that events and circumstances had occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year which indicated that the flushes  spot shot and trade names should no longer be considered to have indefinite lives 
these events and circumstances included the following  all of which indicate that these three trade names are definite lived our strategic decision to divert research and development resources from our flushes  spot shot and trade names so that we can focus more specifically and continue to gain momentum on the development and extension of our multi purpose maintenance products  the tactical manner in which we intend to manage all three trade names in future periods  lost distribution within certain channels for these trade names  which we may or may not be able to recover in future periods  the recent increased variability of promotional activities with certain of our key customers for these trade names  which we may or may not be able to reverse in future periods  and a lower level of forecasted sales for each of these trade names as a result of decreased sales for each in recent periods and the manner in which we intend to manage these trade names in future periods 
as a result of the aforementioned events and circumstances  we determined that it was appropriate to change the flushes  spot shot and trade names from indefinite lived to definite lived intangible assets effective february  we determined the estimated remaining economic lives of the flushes  spot shot and trade names based on future forecasted cash flows for these trade names  as well as the consideration of various other factors 
these factors included the strength of each trade name and their respective market share within the category in which each operates  the stability of the household cleaning products industry  the fact that these trade names have been in existence for a long period of time and are expected to remain in existence for a significant number of years in the future and the fact that no legal  regulatory  or contractual conditions currently exist that would limit their remaining useful lives 
after taking all of these factors into consideration  we concluded that the trade name will generate future cash flows for at least the next twenty years and the flushes and spot shot trade names will generate future cash flows for at least the next seventeen years 
as a result  these are the periods over which each trade name is being amortized on a straight line basis effective march  although we did not identify or record any impairment to our indefinite lived intangible assets in fiscal year  we determined that certain of our indefinite lived intangible assets were impaired in fiscal year as a result of our annual impairment test and the subsequent events and circumstances driven impairment tests that we 
table of contents conducted during fiscal year  we identified and recorded total impairment charges related to our carpet fresh and x brands of million and million  respectively 
this impairment was due to the continued sales declines in fiscal year and the lower level of forecasted sales for the carpet fresh and x brands which were caused by a variety of factors  including lost distribution and the company s strategic decision to focus its research and development resources on its multi purpose maintenance product 
while conducting the subsequent events and circumstances driven impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we also concluded that these two trade names should no longer be considered to have indefinite lives 
as a result  effective august   we changed the classification of the carpet fresh and x trade names from indefinite lived to definite lived intangible assets 
we began to amortize the carpet fresh and x trade names on a straight line basis effective on september  based on their estimated remaining useful lives of thirteen and eight years  respectively 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued updated authoritative guidance to amend the standard for the goodwill impairment test 
the amendments will allow companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
companies no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the updated authoritative guidance will be effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of this guidance on the process and procedures for our goodwill impairment test 
in june  the fasb issued updated authoritative guidance to amend the presentation of comprehensive income 
under these new presentation rules  companies will have the option to present other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
under both alternatives  companies will be required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
in the single continuous statement approach  the guidance requires the entity to present the components of net income and total net income  the components of other comprehensive income and a total for other comprehensive income  along with the total of comprehensive income in that statement 
in the two statement approach  the income statement will be followed immediately by the statement of other comprehensive income  which will include the amount for total comprehensive income 
this updated authoritative guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of this updated authoritative guidance on our consolidated financial statement disclosures 
in may  the fasb issued updated authoritative guidance to amend the fair value measurements and related disclosures 
this guidance relates to a major convergence project of the fasb and the international accounting standards board iasb to improve international financial reporting standards ifrs and us gaap 
this new guidance results in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between ifrs and us gaap 
the new guidance also changes some fair value measurement principles and enhances disclosure requirements related to activities in level of the fair value hierarchy 
the amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we have evaluated this updated authoritative guidance  and we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statement disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued updated authoritative guidance related to when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
per this updated authoritative guidance  when a reporting unit has a zero or negative carrying amount  step of the goodwill impairment test will be performed if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill 
table of contents impairment exists 
the qualitative factors to be considered are consistent with the current interim impairment triggers for goodwill 
upon adoption  an entity will perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired 
furthermore  any impairment identified at the time of adoption will be recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
we are required to apply these new requirements in our fiscal year beginning after december  we have evaluated this updated authoritative guidance  and we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued updated authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements which requires certain new disclosures related to activities in level fair value measurements  including purchases  sales  issuances and settlements 
this updated authoritative guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after december  we have evaluated this updated authoritative guidance  and we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statement disclosures

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values 
all of the company s international subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  the company is exposed to foreign currency related risk when the financial statements of its international subsidiaries are translated for consolidation purposes from functional currencies to us dollars 
this foreign currency risk can affect sales  expenses and profits as well as assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company does not enter into any hedging activities to mitigate this foreign currency translation risk 
the company s uk subsidiary  whose functional currency is pound sterling  utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to limit its exposure in converting cash and intercompany accounts receivable balances denominated in non functional currencies 
the principal currency affected is the euro 
the company regularly monitors its foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
while the company engages in foreign currency hedging activity to reduce its risk  for accounting purposes  none of its foreign currency forward contracts are designated as hedges 
the company has performed a sensitivity analysis related to its foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at august  if the foreign currency exchange rates relevant to those contracts were to change unfavorably by  the company would incur a loss of approximately million 

table of contents interest rate risk as of august   the company had million remaining on its original million  fixed rate term loan 
additionally  the company entered into a million three year revolving credit facility agreement with bank of america  na bank of america in june as a result of the fixed interest rate on the term loan  only the million revolving credit facility is subject to interest rate fluctuations 
under the terms of the credit facility agreement  the company may borrow loans in us dollars or in foreign currencies from time to time during the three year period  which expires on june  all loans denominated in us dollars will accrue interest at the bank s prime rate or at libor plus a margin of percent together with any applicable mandatory liquid asset costs imposed by non us banking regulatory authorities 
all loans denominated in foreign currencies will accrue interest at libor plus percent 
any significant increase in the bank s prime rate and or libor rate could have a material effect on interest expense incurred on any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility
