results of operations sales the company s sales are primarily generated through the operation of big boy restaurants and golden corral restaurants 
big boy sales also include wholesale sales from the company s commissary to restaurants licensed to other big boy operators and the sale of big boy s signature brand tartar sauce to grocery stores 
same store sales comparisons are a key metric that management uses in the operation of the business 
same store sales are affected by changes in customer counts and menu price increases 
changes in sales also occur as new restaurants are opened and older restaurants are closed

year fiscal fiscal the same store sales increases that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and continued through the second quarter of fiscal year was the result of a seasonal promotion that featured baby back ribs on the all you can eat buffet line 
the renewal of the promotion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year was not as successful as the prior year 
the golden corral segment of the business has now experienced a same store sales decline in of the last quarters 
all golden corral same store sales comparisons include average menu price increases of percent in march  percent in january  percent in september  percent in february  percent in may  percent in september and percent in june same store customer counts were percent lower in fiscal year compared with fiscal year  which was percent lower than fiscal year 
table of contents the company operated golden corral restaurants as of may  no golden corral restaurants have been opened or closed since the beginning of fiscal year june 
management has no plans for further development of golden corral restaurants 
three golden corral restaurant operations that were determined to have an impairment of long lived assets at the end of fiscal year remained in operation as of may  while higher menu prices may contribute to the trend in lower customer traffic  a larger concern is the persistently high unemployment rate in the midwest that continues to restrict the disposable income of the customer bases for both big boy and golden corral  which in turn limits sales growth opportunities 
management has no plans to offer competitive discounting or other promotional deals as many other chain restaurant concepts have done during the continued economic downturn to boost their sagging customer traffic because management believes the avoidance of deep discounting has kept the company s sales declines to a minimum  placing it in a solid position of not having to ask customers to give up deals when the economy eventually recovers 
proposed regulations of the menu labeling provisions of the federal patient protection and affordable care act enacted march were issued by the us food and drug administration on april  final regulations are expected by the end of calendar year with implementation required by mid sales volumes in both big boy and golden corral restaurants may be adversely affected if customers significantly alter their dining choices as a result of the requirement to add nutritional information to menus 
the payment card industry security standards council pci has a data security standard with which all entities that process credit and debit card payments must comply 
the standard is designed to prevent credit card fraud by focusing on the internal controls of processing and storing such data 
while the company has long adhered to this standard  an amendment was put in place to require an independent audit to certify the company s compliance with the standards of pci no later than july the company received its attestation of compliance as a result of an independent audit in june a finding of non compliance could have restricted the company s ability to continue accepting credit and debit cards as a form of payment 
gross profit gross profit for the big boy segment includes wholesale sales and cost of wholesale sales 
gross profit differs from restaurant level profit discussed in note g segment information to the consolidated financial statements because advertising expense is charged against restaurant level profit 
gross profit for both operating segments is shown below

table of contents food prices continued to escalate in fiscal year food costs began rising during the last half of fiscal year  after a period of food cost deflation that first emerged during the last half of fiscal year the cost of hamburger and bacon  the two items in the big boy menu mix with the greatest consumption  experienced the largest percentages of increase of all commodities purchased in fiscal year  as compared with the prior year 
elevated prices for most of the commodities that the company uses are expected to continue throughout calendar year  including beef  pork  poultry  dairy and grains 
purchase contracts for some commodities may contain contractual provisions that limit the price the company will pay 
the company does not use financial instruments as a hedge against changes in commodity prices 
the effect of commodity price increases is actively managed with changes to the big boy menu mix and effective selection and rotation of items served on the golden corral buffet  together with periodic increases in menu prices 
however  rapid escalations in the cost of food can be problematic to effective menu management  as evidenced by the rising percentages in the above table despite higher prices being charged to customers 
food and paper cost percentages in the golden corral segment are much higher than big boy because of the all you can eat nature of the golden corral concept  and because steak is featured daily on the buffet line 
food safety poses a major risk to the company 
management rigorously emphasizes and enforces established food safety policies in all of the company s restaurants and in its commissary and food manufacturing plant 
these policies are designed to work cooperatively with programs established by health agencies at all levels of government authority  including the federal hazard analysis of critical control points haccp program 
in addition  the company makes use of servsafe training  a nationally recognized program developed by the national restaurant association 
the servsafe program provides accurate  up to date science based information to all levels of restaurant workers on all aspects of food handling  from receiving and storing to preparing and serving 
all restaurant managers are required to be certified in servsafe training and are required to be re certified every five years 
management initiated an assessment of its food handling  processing and storage practices that are used at the commissary and food manufacturing plant 
completed in october  the assessment concluded that key safety practices that are in place are very well established and functioning properly 
the assessment also noted certain opportunities for improvement  most of which have already been completed  thus providing a solid foundation for ultimate compliance with the federal food safety modernization act that was signed into law in january payroll and related costs have benefitted from the federal hiring incentives to restore employment act of hire act enacted march under which the company did not have to pay the employer s share of social security fica taxes through december  on certain employees hired in calendar year fica credits under the hire act amounted to  during fiscal year notwithstanding the improvements shown in some of the payroll and related cost percentages in the above table  operating margins continue to be adversely affected by mandated increases in the minimum wage in ohio  where more than two thirds of the company s payroll costs are incurred  the minimum wage for non tipped employees was increased percent from per hour to per hour beginning january  it was increased to per hour on january  and to per hour on january  while there was no increase on january   the minimum increased to per hour on january  the ohio minimum wage for tipped employees increased percent from per hour to per hour beginning january  it was increased to per hour on january  and to per hour on january  while there was no increase on january   the minimum increased to per hour on january  federal minimum wage statutes currently apply to substantially all other non ohio employees 
the federal minimum wage for non tipped employees increased from per hour to per hour in july it was increased to per hour in july and to per hour in july the rate for tipped employees non ohio was not affected by the federal legislation  remaining at per hour 
although there is no seasonal fluctuation in employment levels  the number of hours worked by hourly paid employees has always been managed closely according to sales patterns in individual restaurants 
however  the 
table of contents effects of paying the mandated higher hourly rates of pay have been and are continuing to be countered through the combination of reductions in the number of scheduled labor hours and higher menu prices charged to customers 
without benefit of reductions in labor hours  the ohio minimum wage increases on january  and january  would have added an estimated  and  respectively  to annual payroll costs in ohio restaurant operations  and the july increase in the federal minimum wage would have added an estimated  to annual payroll costs in non ohio restaurant operations 
despite the savings that come from reductions in hours worked and higher menu prices charged to customers  other factors add to payroll and related costs 
these factors include higher costs associated with benefit programs offered by the company  including significant increases in medical insurance premiums and pension related costs 
medical insurance premiums totaled approximately  for the plan year that ended december   an increase of percent over the plan year ended december   and percent higher than the plan year ended december  the company typically absorbs to percent of the cost  with employees contributing the remainder 
premium cost is currently projected to be percent higher in the calendar year  exceeding a level of  management continues to evaluate health care reform legislation the federal patient protection and affordable care act  enacted march and its potential effects upon the company  as the us health and human services department and other federal agencies release their regulations 
net periodic pension cost was   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and the higher costs in fiscal years and are primarily the result of market losses experienced in fiscal year  which lowered the fair value of plan assets at the end of fiscal year to  from  at the end of the previous year 
settlement losses of  and  respectively  were included in the net periodic pension costs for fiscal years and no settlement losses were incurred in fiscal year settlement losses are triggered when the sum of all settlements lump sum cash outs exceed interest and service cost  which occurred in fiscal years and in the pension plan that covers hourly restaurant employees 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to compute pension cost was percent in fiscal year  which was lowered from percent in fiscal years and the assumption will remain at percent for the determination of pension costs for fiscal year net periodic pension cost increases by approximately  for each decrease of basis points in the expected return assumption 
the discount rate used in the actuarial assumptions to compute pension costs was percent in fiscal year  which was lowered from percent in fiscal years and the rate for fiscal year will be lowered to percent 
net periodic pension cost will increase by approximately  for each decrease of basis points in the discount rate 
the rate of compensation increase used to calculate pension costs was percent in fiscal years and  which was lowered from percent in fiscal year it will remain at percent for fiscal year net periodic pension cost for fiscal year is currently estimated at approximately  which includes a benefit in excess of  from changes in assumptions relating to retirement  termination and marriage 
contributions made to company sponsored plans were   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and contributions for fiscal year are currently anticipated to be at least  future funding of the pension plans largely depends upon the performance of investments that are held in trusts that have been established for the plans 
equity securities comprise percent of the target allocation of the plans assets 
the fair value of all plan assets was   and  respectively at the end of fiscal years  and notwithstanding market rebounds in both fiscal years and  the market declines experienced in fiscal year are likely to take several years from which to fully recover 
as a result  future funding and net periodic pension costs will remain much higher than historical levels for years to come 
pension accounting standards require the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension plans to be recognized as an asset or liability in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
funded status is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and projected benefit obligations pbo  which includes a projection of future salary increases 
underfunded status at may  was  an improvement from  at june  the improvement was primarily the result of the increase in the fair value of the plans assets 
however  it should be noted that the pbo received the benefit from changes in assumptions retirement  termination 
table of contents and marriage approximating  which was offset by approximately  from lowering the discount rate from percent to percent 
a  increase in the company s equity  net of tax  was required at may  to establish underfunded status at  the increase in equity was effected through a credit to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
equity was reduced  net of tax  to establish underfunded status of  at june   effected through a charge against accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the hourly pension plan plan was amended on july  to freeze all future accruals for credited service under the plan after august  the plan had previously been closed to all hourly paid restaurant employees hired after december  the salaried pension plan was amended on july  to close admission to salaried employees hired after june  salaried employees hired before june  continue to participate in the salaried pension plan and receive credit with normal benefits for years of service 
the company self insures a significant portion of expected losses from its ohio workers compensation program 
initial self insurance reserves are accrued based on prior claims history  including an amount developed for incurred but unreported claims 
active management of claims  which includes a requirement for post accident drug testing  keeps the number of claims and the average cost per claim to a minimum 
payroll and related costs are also affected when management performs a comprehensive review each quarter of the ohio workers compensation program and adjusts its reserves as deemed necessary based on claims experience 
the reserves were increased charged against earnings by  and  respectively  during fiscal year and fiscal year the reserves were decreased credited to earnings by  in fiscal year other operating costs include occupancy costs such as maintenance  rent  depreciation  property tax  insurance and utilities  plus costs relating to field supervision  accounting and payroll preparation costs  franchise fees for golden corral restaurants  new restaurant opening costs  and many other restaurant operating costs 
opening costs can have a significant effect on the operating costs for the applicable period 
opening costs all for big boy no golden corral restaurants have been opened during the last three fiscal years in fiscal years  and were   and  respectively 
as most of the other typical expenses charged to other operating costs tend to be more fixed in nature  the percentages shown in the above table can be greatly affected by changes in same store sales levels 
in other words  percentages rise when sales decrease and percentages will decrease when sales increase 
other operating costs in fiscal year included a charge of  to write down the carrying value of a big boy restaurant that permanently ceased operations on may  other operating costs for the golden corral segment are a much higher percentage of sales than big boy because the physical facility of a golden corral restaurant is roughly twice as large as a big boy restaurant and golden corral sales volumes have generally remained well below management s original long term expectations 
operating profit to arrive at the measure of operating profit  administrative and advertising expense is subtracted from gross profit  while the line item for franchise fees and other revenue is added to it 
gains and losses from the sale of real property if any are then respectively added or subtracted 
charges for impairment of assets if any are also subtracted from gross profit to arrive at the measure of operating profit 
operating profit in fiscal year included certain amounts discussed below credited to earnings in connection with the settlement of a long standing legal matter 
administrative and advertising expense was   and  respectively in fiscal years  and advertising expense represents the largest component of these costs 
advertising expense was   and  respectively in fiscal years  and spending for advertising and marketing programs is proportionate to sales levels  reflecting the company s long standing policy to spend a constant percentage of big boy and golden corral sales on advertising and marketing 
on january   golden corral advertising fees were increased from percent to percent of sales  allowing additional national media buying by golden corral franchising systems  inc  which effectively expanded cable television spots in all the company s market areas 
all other administrative costs were   and  respectively in fiscal years  and the chief executive officer s incentive compensation was included in other administrative costs as follows   and  respectively was accrued in fiscal years  and stock based compensation costs included in other administrative costs were   and  respectively in fiscal years  and fiscal year 
table of contents included a charge in other administrative costs of  to write off deposits for golden corral development rights 
revenue from franchise fees is based upon sales volumes generated by big boy restaurants that are licensed to other operators 
the fees are based principally on percentages of sales and are recorded on the accrual method as earned 
as of may   big boy restaurants were licensed to other operators and paying franchise fees to the company 
no new licensed big boy restaurants opened during any of the periods presented in this md a  one closed during fiscal year and two closed during fiscal year other revenue also includes certain other fees earned from restaurants licensed to others along with minimal amounts of rent and investment income 
gains and losses from the sale of assets consist of transactions involving real property and sometimes may include restaurant equipment that is sold together with real property as a package when closed restaurants are sold 
gains and losses reported on this line do not include abandonment losses that routinely arise when certain equipment is replaced before it reaches the end of its expected life  abandonment losses are instead reported in other operating costs 
losses from sales involving real property in fiscal year amounted to  primarily the result of the march sale of certain surplus property 
total sale proceeds in fiscal year were  no sales of real property occurred during fiscal year gains from sales involving real property in fiscal year amounted to  on aggregate proceeds of  the gains in fiscal year are primarily attributable to the disposition of a big boy restaurant that had ceased operations in june  the gain from which was  on proceeds of  during fiscal year  the company received  in full and final settlement of the arbitration award in the long standing case by the company against the general contractor that had constructed a golden corral restaurant in canton  ohio in  which the company had to subsequently demolish due to defective construction 
in addition to the cash received  an additional credit to earnings of  was recorded to reverse a liability representing the general contractor s claim against the company for the outstanding contract balance  which was eliminated when the arbitration award was made final 
no significant charges for impairment of assets were recorded during fiscal years  or interest expense interest expense was   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and the decreasing trend is primarily the result of lower debt levels 
in addition  the weighted average interest rate on fixed rate financing has moved lower reflecting the retirement of older fixed rate loans that had higher interest rates 
income taxes income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax earnings was percent in fiscal year  percent in fiscal year and percent in fiscal year the effective rates have been kept consistently low through the company s use of available tax credits  principally the federal credit allowed for employer social security and medicare taxes paid on certain employee tips and the federal work opportunity tax credit wotc 
these credits are generally more favorable to the effective tax rate when pretax earnings decrease 
the company believes it has no uncertain tax positions that have been filed or that are expected to be taken on a future tax return 
the internal revenue service completed its examination of the company s tax return for fiscal year in november the examination resulted in no changes 
liquidity and capital resources sources of funds food sales to restaurant customers provide the company s principal source of cash 
the funds from sales are immediately available for the company s use  as substantially all sales to restaurant customers are received in currency or are settled by debit or credit cards 
the primary source of cash provided by operating activities is net earnings plus depreciation and impairment of assets  if any 
other sources of cash may include borrowing against credit lines  proceeds received when stock options are exercised and occasional sales of real estate 
in addition to 
table of contents servicing debt  these cash flows are utilized for discretionary objectives  including capital projects principally restaurant expansion  capital stock repurchases and dividends 
working capital practices the company has historically maintained a strategic negative working capital position  which is a common practice in the restaurant industry 
as significant cash flows are consistently provided by operations and credit lines remain readily available  this practice should not hinder the company s ability to satisfactorily retire any of its obligations when due  including the aggregated contractual obligations and commercial commitments shown in the following table 
aggregated information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of may  payments due by period in thousands more than total year year year year year years long term debt interest on long term debt estimated rent due under capital lease obligations rent due under operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations operating leases may include option periods yet to be exercised  when exercise is determined to be reasonably assured

deferred compensation liability undiscounted 
the working capital deficit was  as of may  the deficit was  as of june  most of the improvement is attributable to a higher level of cash on hand as of may   and higher prepaid and refundable income taxes 
the company has had a financing package of unsecured credit facilities in place for many years with the same lending institution 
the financing package was amended and restated in october loan agreement 
the loan agreement increased the amount available to be borrowed on the construction loan to  up  from the  that had remained available from the previous renewal cycle 
as of may    remained available to be borrowed 
the loan agreement also renewed the  revolving loan  which provides financing to fund temporary working capital if needed unused as of may  
in addition  the loan agreement provides a new  stock repurchase loan  under which  remained available to be borrowed as of may  all remaining funds available under the loan agreement are readily accessible for borrowing through april the company expects to encounter no difficulties in extending the loan agreement prior to its scheduled expiration in april the company is in compliance with the covenants contained in the loan agreement 

table of contents operating activities operating cash flows were  in fiscal year  which compares with  in fiscal year and  fiscal year these changes are usually attributable to normal changes in assets and liabilities such as prepaid expenses  inventories and accounts payable and accrued  prepaid and deferred income taxes  all of which can and often do fluctuate widely from year to year 
the small business jobs act of  federal legislation that was signed into law in september  extended bonus depreciation through december   which had previously expired december  the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of  federal legislation that was signed into law in december  extended bonus depreciation through december  the combined effect of the two pieces of legislation allows the company to immediately write off percent of the cost of certain capital expenditures made between january  and september   and percent of certain capital spending costs from september  through december  two automatic change in accounting method applications were filed by the company with the internal revenue service that affect fiscal year the change in accounting method for depreciation and amortization was filed to segregate certain restaurant building costs to their proper categories shorter recovery periods for depreciation purposes 
the change in accounting method for incidental repairs and maintenance was filed to allow the immediate deduction of certain repairs and maintenance costs  replacing previous accounting that capitalized these costs 
the bonus depreciation legislation  together with the two automatic change in accounting method applications  allowed the company to reduce its fiscal year tax deposits by over  compared with fiscal year management measures cash flows from the operation of the business by simply adding to net earnings certain non cash expenses such as depreciation  losses net of any gains on dispositions of assets  charges for impairment of long lived assets if any  stock based compensation costs and pension costs in excess of plan contributions 
the result of this approach is shown as a sub total in the consolidated statement of cash flows  in fiscal year   in fiscal year and  in fiscal year investing activities capital spending is the principal component of the company s investing activities 
capital spending was  during fiscal year  which included  for big boy restaurants and  for golden corral restaurants 
these capital expenditures consisted of site acquisitions for expansion  new restaurant construction  ongoing reinvestments in existing restaurants including remodelings  routine equipment replacements and other maintenance capital expenditures 
proceeds from sales involving real property during fiscal year amounted to  primarily the result of the march sale of certain surplus property 
no sales of real property occurred in fiscal year sales involving real property in fiscal year yielded proceeds of  primarily the result of selling a big boy restaurant that had ceased operations in june to make room for redevelopment 
total proceeds from disposition of property as shown on the consolidated statement of cash flows include amounts received from completely separate transactions to sell used equipment and or other operating assets 
two former big boy restaurants and seven surplus land locations are currently held for sale at an aggregate asking price of approximately  financing activities borrowing against credit lines amounted to  during fiscal year  consisting of  borrowed to finance construction and  borrowed specifically to fund repurchases of the company s common stock 
scheduled and other payments of long term debt and capital lease obligations amounted to  during fiscal year regular quarterly cash dividends to shareholders amounted to  in fiscal year  or per share 
the dividend per share was in fiscal year and in fiscal year a per share quarterly dividend was declared on june  its payment on july  was the nd consecutive quarterly dividend paid by the company 
the company currently expects to continue its year practice of paying regular quarterly cash dividends

other information four new big boy restaurants were opened for business in fiscal year three of the four restaurants were constructed on land that was acquired in fee simple estate during fiscal year the fourth one was built on land that is occupied pursuant to the terms of a capital lease 
as of may   two new big boy restaurants were under construction  one on land owned in fee simple estate  the other on land leased to the company 
openings are currently scheduled for july and september three other sites owned by the company are in the pipeline for future construction  including two that were acquired in fiscal year any other contracts to acquire promising sites for future development are cancellable at the company s sole discretion while due diligence is pursued under the inspection period provisions of the respective contracts 
including land and land improvements  the cost required to build and equip each new big boy restaurant currently ranges from  to  the actual cost depends greatly on the price paid for the land and the cost of land improvements  which can vary widely from location to location  and whether the land is purchased or leased 
costs also depend on whether the new restaurant is constructed using plans for the original building prototype  square feet with seating for guests or its smaller adaptation  the building prototype  square feet with seating for guests  which is used in smaller trade areas 
the building prototype was used to construct all four big boy restaurants that opened during fiscal year the building prototype is being used to build the two restaurants that were under construction as of may  approximately one fifth of the big boy restaurants are routinely renovated or decoratively updated each year 
the renovations not only refresh and upgrade interior finishes  but are also designed to synchronize the interiors and exteriors of older restaurants with that of newly constructed restaurants 
the current cost to renovate a big boy restaurant ranges from  to  the fiscal year remodeling budget is  in addition  certain high volume big boy restaurants are regularly evaluated to determine whether their kitchens should be 
table of contents redesigned for increased efficiencies and whether an expansion of the dining room is warranted 
a typical kitchen redesign costs approximately  and a dining room expansion can cost up to the fiscal year remodeling budget for golden corral restaurants is approximately  this includes the carryover cost to complete four restaurants for which work was not completed in the prior year  and three other restaurants that will be remodeled over the winter months 
golden corral restaurants are remodeled every seven years  but replacement of carpeting occurs every months 
the company possesses development rights to open up to more golden corrals by december  these rights were acquired several years ago when the company paid  in initial franchise fees 
because management determined that no further golden corral restaurants will be developed  the  fee balance was written off during fiscal year although part of the company s strategic plan entails owning the land on which it builds new restaurants  it is sometimes necessary to enter ground leases to obtain desirable land on which to build 
seven of the golden corral restaurants and four big boy restaurants that have opened since were built on leased land 
as of may   restaurants were operating on non owned premises  of which are being accounted for as operating leases with one treated as a capital lease 
in addition  an operating lease is in place for land on which construction of a big boy restaurant is currently in progress 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use estimates and assumptions to measure certain items that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
these judgments are based on knowledge and experience about past and current events  and assumptions about future events 
accounting estimates can and do change as new events occur and additional information becomes available 
actual results may differ markedly from current judgment 
two factors are required for an accounting policy to be deemed critical 
the policy must be significant to the fair presentation of a company s financial condition and its results of operations  and the policy must require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
management believes the following to be the company s critical accounting policies 
self insurance the company self insures a significant portion of expected losses from its workers compensation program in the state of ohio 
the company purchases coverage from an insurance company for individual claims in excess of  reserves for claims expense include a provision for incurred but not reported claims 
each quarter  management reviews claims valued by the third party administrator tpa of the program and then applies experience and judgment to determine the most probable future value of incurred claims 
as the tpa submits additional new information  management reviews it in light of historical claims for similar injuries  probability of settlement  and any other facts that might provide guidance in determining ultimate value of individual claims 
unexpected changes in any of these or other factors could result in actual costs differing materially from initial projections or values presently carried in the self insurance reserves 
pension plans pension plan accounting requires rate assumptions for future compensation increases and the long term investment return on plan assets 
a discount rate is also applied to the calculations of net periodic pension cost and projected benefit obligations 
a committee comprised of executives from the finance department and the human resources department  with guidance provided by the company s actuarial consulting firm  develops these assumptions each year 
the consulting firm also provides services in calculating estimated future obligations and net periodic pension cost 
to determine the long term rate of return on plan assets  the committee reviews the target asset allocation of plan assets and determines the expected return on each asset class 
the expected returns for each asset class are combined and rounded to the nearest basis points to determine the overall expected return on assets 
the committee determines the discount rate by looking at the projected future benefit payments by year and matches 
table of contents them to spot rates based on yields of high grade corporate bonds over the term of projected benefit payments 
a single discount rate is selected  and then rounded to the nearest basis points  which produces the same present value as the various spot rates 
assets of the pension plans are targeted to be invested percent in equity securities  as these investments have historically provided the greatest long term returns 
poor performance in equity securities markets can significantly lower the market values of the plans investment portfolios  which  in turn  can result in a material increases in future funding requirements  b much higher net periodic pension costs to be recognized in future years  and c the plans reaching underfunded status  requiring the company s equity to be reduced 
long lived assets long lived assets include property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
property and equipment typically approximates to percent of the company s total assets 
judgments and estimates are used to determine the carrying value of long lived assets 
this includes the assignment of appropriate useful lives  which affect depreciation and amortization expense 
capitalization policies are continually monitored to assure they remain appropriate 
management considers a history of cash flow losses on a restaurant by restaurant basis to be the primary indicator of potential impairment 
carrying values of property and equipment are tested for impairment at least annually  and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired 
when undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than carrying values  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which carrying values exceed the greater of the net present value of the future cash flow stream or a floor value 
future cash flows can be difficult to predict 
changing neighborhood demographics and economic conditions  and many other factors may influence operating performance  which affect cash flows 
floor values are generally determined by opinions of value provided by real estate brokers and or management s judgment as developed through its experience in disposing of property 
sometimes it becomes necessary to cease operating a certain restaurant due to poor operating performance 
the ultimate loss can be significantly different from the original impairment charge  particularly if the eventual market price received from the disposition of the property differs materially from initial estimates of floor values 
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or whenever an impairment indicator arises 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has no significant market risk exposure to interest rate changes as substantially all of its debt is currently financed with fixed interest rates  or will be converted to fixed rate term loans in the next six months 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
any cash equivalents maintained by the company have original maturities of three months or less 
the company does not use any foreign currency in its operations 
operations in the big boy segment are vertically integrated  using centralized purchasing and food preparation  provided through the company s commissary and food manufacturing plant 
management believes the commissary operation ensures uniform product quality and safety  timeliness of distribution to restaurants and creates efficiencies that ultimately result in lower food and supply costs 
the commissary operation does not supply golden corral restaurants 
commodity pricing affects the cost of many of the company s food products 
commodity pricing can be extremely volatile  affected by many factors outside of the company s control  including import and export restrictions  the influence of currency markets relative to the us dollar  supply versus demand  production levels and the impact that adverse weather conditions may have on crop yields 
certain commodities purchased by the commissary  principally beef  chicken  pork  dairy products  fish  french fries and coffee  are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
purchase contracts for some of these items may contain contractual provisions that limit the price to be paid 
these contracts are normally for periods of one year or less but may have longer terms if favorable long term pricing becomes available 
food supplies are generally plentiful and may be obtained from any number of suppliers  which mitigates the company s overall commodity cost risk 
quality  
table of contents timeliness of deliveries and price are the principal determinants of source 
the company does not use financial instruments as a hedge against changes in commodity pricing 
except for items such as bread  fresh produce and dairy products that are purchased from any number of reliable local suppliers  the golden corral segment of the business currently purchases substantially all food  beverage and other menu items from the same approved vendor that golden corral franchising systems  inc the franchisor uses in its operations 
deliveries are received twice per week 
other vendors are available to provide products that meet the franchisor s specifications at comparable prices should the company wish or need to make a change
