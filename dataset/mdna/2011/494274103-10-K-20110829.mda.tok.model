item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview kimball international  inc provides a variety of products from its two business segments the electronic manufacturing services ems segment and the furniture segment 
the ems segment provides engineering and manufacturing services which utilize common production and support capabilities globally to the medical  automotive  industrial control  and public safety industries 
the furniture segment provides furniture for the office and hospitality industries  sold under the company family of brand names 
overall market conditions in the ems industry continue to be favorable 
as reported in the july manufacturing market insider mmi publication  an ems industry sales projection by new venture research shows forecasted growth for calendar year of compared to calendar year in addition in june  the semiconductor industry association sia endorsed a forecast of growth of semiconductor sales for calendar year  and although the company does not directly serve this market  it may be indicative of increased end market demand for products utilizing electronic components 
in the ems segment  the company focuses on the four key vertical markets of medical  automotive  industrial control  and public safety 
demand in the medical and industrial control markets are showing signs of strength 
automotive activity was mixed as true end market demand was somewhat masked by reduced vehicle production and lower dealer inventories caused by the march earthquake and tsunami in japan 
the public safety market remains stable 
sales to customers in the medical industry are the largest portion of the company ems segment with sales to customers in the automotive industry being the second largest of the four vertical markets 
the company sales to customers in the automotive industry are diversified among more than ten domestic and foreign customers and represented approximately one fourth of the ems segment net sales for fiscal year the office furniture and hospitality furniture markets continue to show signs of improvement 
as of may  the business and institutional furniture manufacturer association bifma projected a year over year increase in the office furniture industry for calendar year compared to the increase in calendar year and the decrease in calendar year bifma projects office furniture industry growth of approximately in calendar year which would bring the industry closer to pre recession levels 
in addition  the hotel industry forecasts reported by smith travel research and pricewaterhousecoopers llp project occupancy rates to increase approximately in calendar year after a increase in calendar year and a industry decline in calendar year and project revenue per available room to increase for calendar year after a increase in calendar year and a industry decline in calendar year competitive pricing pressures within both the ems segment and the furniture segment continue to put a strain on the company operating margins 
the company is committed to ensuring it sustains the cost efficiencies and process improvements undertaken during the recession 
in addition  a long standing component of the company profit sharing incentive bonus plan is that it is linked to the performance of the company which automatically lowers total compensation expense when profits are down and likewise increases total compensation expense when profits are up 
the focus on cost control continues 
at the same time  the company has continued making prudent investments in product development  technology  and marketing and business development initiatives to drive profitable growth 
the company also continues to closely monitor market changes and its liquidity in order to proactively adjust its operating costs  discretionary capital spending  and dividend levels as needed 
the company continued to maintain a strong balance sheet as of the end of fiscal year  which included minimal long term debt of million and share owners equity of million 
the company short term liquidity available  represented as cash and cash equivalents plus the unused amount of the company revolving credit facility  was million at june  in addition to the above risks related to the current market conditions  management currently considers the following events  trends  and uncertainties to be most important to understanding the company financial condition and operating performance the nature of the ems industry is such that the start up of new programs to replace departing customers or expiring programs occurs frequently 
the company sales to bayer ag began to decline in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as the company primary manufacturing contract with bayer ag expired 
margins on the bayer ag product were generally lower than the company other ems products 
the success of the company ems segment is dependent on the successful replacement of such customers or programs 
such changes usually occur gradually over time as old programs phase out of production while newer programs ramp up 
the transition to new programs may temporarily reduce sales and increase operating costs  resulting in a temporary decline in operating profit at the impacted business unit 
see 
item a risk factors for more information on the risks related to contract customers

the company continues to monitor ems customers and suppliers who were affected either by physical damage to production facilities or indirect production impacts caused by electricity blackouts or aftershocks 
there has been minimal disruption in the supply chain up to this point  but customers could still be impacted with part shortages unrelated to electronic components  and their production schedule reductions could cause the company to have delayed or canceled orders 
the company has maintained close communications with customers and suppliers 
commodity price pressure is expected to continue in the near term 
mitigating the impact of higher commodity and fuel prices continues to be an area of focus within the company 
the company will continue its focus on preserving cash 
managing working capital in conjunction with fluctuating demand levels is key 
in addition  the company plans to minimize capital expenditures where appropriate but has been and will continue to invest in capital expenditures for projects including potential acquisitions that would enhance the company capabilities and diversification while providing an opportunity for growth and improved profitability 
management continues to evaluate and monitor the implementation of the healthcare reform legislation that was signed into law in march this legislation is expected to increase the company healthcare and related administrative expenses 
globalization continues to reshape not only the industries in which the company operates but also its key customers and competitors 
the increasingly competitive marketplace mandates that the company continually re evaluate its business models 
the company employees throughout its business operations are an integral part of the company ability to compete successfully  and the stability of its management team is critical to long term share owner value 
the company career development and succession planning processes help to maintain stability in management

these foreign credit facilities can be canceled at any time by either the bank or the company 
the company believes its principal sources of liquidity from available funds on hand  cash generated from operations  and the availability of borrowing under the company credit facilities will be sufficient for fiscal year and the foreseeable future 
one of the company sources of funds has been its ability to generate cash from operations to meet its liquidity obligations  which during fiscal year was hampered by working capital variations which negatively impacted cash balances  and could be adversely affected in the future by factors such as general economic and market conditions  lack of availability of raw material components in the supply chain  a decline in demand for the company products  loss of key contract customers  the ability of the company to generate profits  and other unforeseen circumstances 
in particular  should demand for the company products decrease significantly over the next months  the available cash provided by operations could be adversely impacted 
another source of funds is the company credit facilities 
the million credit facility is contingent on complying with certain debt covenants 
the preceding statements are forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements 
fair value during fiscal year  no level or level financial instruments were affected by a lack of market liquidity 
for level financial assets  readily available market pricing was used to value the financial instruments 
the company foreign currency derivatives  which were classified as level assets liabilities  were independently valued using observable market inputs such as forward interest rate yield curves  current spot rates  and time value calculations 
to verify the reasonableness of the independently determined fair values  these derivative fair values were compared to fair values calculated by the counterparty banks 
the company own credit risk and counterparty credit risk had an immaterial impact on the valuation of the foreign currency derivatives 
the company invested in convertible promissory notes and stock warrants of a privately held company during fiscal year during fiscal year  the convertible promissory notes experienced an other than temporary decline in fair market value resulting in a million impairment loss and  upon a qualified financing  were subsequently converted to non marketable equity securities which are accounted for as a cost method investment 
the stock warrants  classified as derivative instruments  were valued on a recurring basis using a market based method which utilizes the black scholes valuation model which resulted in a million derivative gain as a result of the qualified financing 
the fair value measurements for the stock warrants were calculated using unobservable inputs and were classified as level financial assets
