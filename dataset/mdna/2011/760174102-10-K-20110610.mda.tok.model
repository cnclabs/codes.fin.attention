item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business trends our corporate structure includes separate advanced media and information ami and home entertainment he operating divisions and  accordingly  we report certain financial information by individual segment under this structure 
our ami division encompasses media measurement services across multiple platforms and is delivered via web based products within our entertainment essentials lines of business 
these services  offered primarily on a recurring subscription basis  capture consumer viewing data and provide film studios  television networks and stations  cable  satellite and telecommunications company telco operators and advertisers insights into consumer viewing patterns integrated with consumer segmentation and purchase behavior databases 
our services provide thorough  expansive data for box office results  local  national and on demand television performance  mobile viewing  and broadband usage  with additional products currently under development 
our he division services incorporate a unique set of applications designed to help clients maintain and direct their business practices relating to home video products 
through our ppt system  video retailers are given access to a wide selection of box office hits  independent releases and foreign films from the industry s leading suppliers on a revenue sharing basis 
by providing second and third tier retailers the opportunity to acquire new inventory in the same manner as major national chains  our ppt system enables retailers everywhere  regardless of size  to increase both the depth and breadth of their inventory  better satisfy consumer demand and more effectively compete in the marketplace 
we lease product from our program suppliers  participating retailers sublease that product from us and rent it to consumers 
participating retailers then share a portion of the revenue from each retail rental transaction with us and we share a portion of the revenue with the program suppliers 
our ppt system supplies both content providers and retailers with the intelligence and infrastructure necessary to make revenue sharing a viable and productive option 
our he division also includes our rental studio direct revenue sharing drs services  which grants content providers constant  clear feedback and data  plus valuable checks and balances on how both their video products and retailers are performing 
data relating to rented entertainment content is received on both physical and digital product under established agreements on a fee for service basis 
see forward looking statements on page ami division our current spending  investment and long term strategic planning is heavily focused on the development  growth and expansion of our ami division  both domestically and internationally 
as such  we continue to allocate significant resources towards our entertainment essentials services and product lines  both those which are currently operational as well as those that are in various stages of development 
our ami division revenue increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal our acquisition of nielsen edi limited the edi business and cin chiffres  which occurred in january and november  respectively  contributed million of the revenue increase during fiscal  while our existing lines of business saw revenue growth of million  or 
the ami division lines of business are box office essentials  which includes the edi business  ondemand essentials  tv essentials  which includes stationview essentials  mobile essentials and internet tv essentials  and all other  which primarily includes home entertainment essentials 

table of contents the he division the financial results from the he division continue to be affected by the changing dynamics in the home video rental market as well as overall economic trends and conditions 
this market is highly competitive and influenced greatly by consumer spending patterns and behaviors 
the end consumer has a wide variety of choices from which to select entertainment content and can easily shift from one provider to another 
some examples include renting product from our participating retailers or other retailers  purchasing previously viewed units from our participating retailers or other retailers  ordering product via online subscriptions and or online distributors mail delivery  renting or purchasing product from kiosk locations  subscribing to at home movie channels  downloading or streaming content via the internet  purchasing and owning the unit directly  or selecting an at home pay per view or on demand option from a satellite or cable provider 
our ppt system focuses primarily on the traditional brick and mortar retailer 
in an effort to stabilize and maintain our current level of overall he division revenue and earnings  we have implemented strategies to obtain new participating retailers  as well as assist in the retention and growth of our current participating retailers 
the popularity of the other choices an end consumer has to obtain entertainment content has been growing  and our participating retailers market share has been negatively affected 
thus  for the foreseeable future  we expect our revenue in the he division to continue to decline 
in may  a major brick and mortar retailer  movie gallery  with  locations  announced the closure of all of its stores 
also  during september  blockbuster entertainment blockbuster filed for chapter bankruptcy protection and closed several brick and mortar retail locations as a result 
during april  blockbuster s assets were acquired by dish network corporation  and it is expected they will continue with the delivery of home entertainment content 
while movie gallery and blockbuster were not direct customers of ours  we believe the major brick and mortar retailers share of the overall industry is contracting as a result of these closures and related financial events 
however  we also believe this presents opportunities that potentially benefit our participating retailers through increased traffic from new customers and the opportunity to expand their businesses through the addition of store locations  it is too soon to predict what effect  if any  this will have on our future financial results 
we continue to be in good standing with our program suppliers  and we make on going efforts to strengthen those business relationships through enhancements to our current service offerings and the development of new service offerings 
we are also continually seeking to develop business relationships with new program suppliers 
our relationships with program suppliers typically may be terminated without cause upon thirty days written notice by either party 
sources of revenue revenue by segment includes the following ami division subscription fee and other revenue  primarily relating to custom reports  from box office essentials  ondemand essentials  tv essentials  which includes stationview essentials  mobile essentials and internet tv essentials  and all other  which primarily includes home entertainment essentials 
he division transaction fees are generated when participating retailers rent units to consumers 
additionally  certain arrangements include guaranteed minimum revenue from our customers  which are recognized on the street release date  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met please refer to critical accounting policies at the end of this item  sell through fees are generated when participating retailers sell previously viewed rental units to consumers and or buy out fees generated when participating retailers purchase units at the end of the lease term  drs fees are generated from data tracking and reporting services provided to program suppliers  and other fees  which primarily include order processing fees  are generated when units are ordered by  and distributed to  participating retailers

the increase in tv essentials revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the addition of clients who subscribe to our systems and other fees relating to periodic custom work 
the increase in tv essentials revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the fact that tv essentials did not begin generating recurring revenue until the second half of fiscal we also added new clients to this service line in fiscal revenue related to our essentials business information service offerings increased primarily due to our continued investment in  and successful marketing of  these offerings and retention of clients 
we expect continued future increases in our essentials revenue as a result of further investments  development and expansion of new and existing services  both domestically and internationally

minimum guarantees increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the timing and quality of releases 
the decrease in rental transactions was due to fewer participating retailers  as well as continued changing market conditions 
the decrease in transaction fees in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to fewer rental transactions at our participating retailers  which decreased  as well as to a decrease in the rate per transaction  which decreased  excluding the impact of minimum guarantees 
the decrease in transactions was due in part to volume decreases as a result of the cumulative effect of fewer theatrical releases by our program suppliers in fiscal  as well as continued changing market conditions 
the decrease in the rate per transaction in fiscal was a result of the timing of releases with guaranteed units 
the decrease in sell through fees in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in sell through volume and the overall rate per transaction 
the decrease in sell through volume was primarily due to an overall decline in units available for sale 
the number of transactions decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  and the rate per transaction decreased 
the decrease in sell through fees in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in the number of used sale transactions  as a result of an overall decline in units available for sale 
units shipped decreased 
the increase in drs revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher volumes of transactions from on line retailers and the addition of kiosk transactions in fiscal  partially offset by fewer transactions as a result of movie gallery s store closures 
the increase also reflects our acquisition of media salvation  which contributed million to the increase 
the decrease in drs fees in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in the number of transactions processed as a result of an overall decline in activity experienced by drs brick and mortar retailers 
the decreases in other revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal were primarily due to decreases in order processing fee revenue as a result of a reduction in the number of units shipped 

table of contents cost of sales cost of sales consists of unit costs  transaction costs  sell through costs  handling and freight costs in the he division and costs in the ami division associated with certain essentials business information service offerings 
these expenditures represent the direct costs to produce revenue 
in the ami division  cost of sales primarily consists of costs associated with the operation of a call center for our box office essentials services  as well as costs associated with amortizing capitalized internally developed software used to provide the corresponding services and direct costs incurred to obtain  cleanse and process data and maintain our systems 
in the he division  unit costs  transaction costs and sell through costs represent the amounts due to the program suppliers that hold the distribution rights to the units 
freight costs represent the cost to pick  pack and ship orders of units to the participating retailers 
our cost of sales can also be affected by the release dates of units with guarantees 
we recognize the guaranteed minimum costs on the release date 
the terms of some of our agreements result in cost of sales on titles in the first month in which the unit is released  which results in lower margins during the initial portion of the revenue sharing period 
once the unit s rental activity exceeds the required amount for these guaranteed minimums  margins generally expand during the second and third months of the unit s revenue sharing period 
however  since these factors are highly dependent upon the quality  timing and release dates of all new products  margins may not expand to any significant degree during any reporting period 
as a result  it is difficult to predict the impact these program supplier revenue sharing programs with guaranteed minimums will have on future results of operations in any reporting period

gross margins as a percentage of revenue are as follows year ended march  ami division he division in the ami division  margins improved in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the growth in revenue 
these improvements were partially offset by a million charge in the third quarter of fiscal related to an amendment to an agreement with one of our data partners 
this amendment allows us to provide more robust information reporting to our clients and furthers our efforts toward moving our products from data to knowledge based products and services that interpret this data 
additionally  the agreement was converted from a variable agreement based on revenue to a fixed fee arrangement 
we do not expect this change to materially affect our margins over the long term 
the decrease in ami division margins in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to growth in our service offerings  which resulted in increased call center charges  and additional revenue sharing arrangements in place with data providers 
the improvement in gross margins in the he division in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increases in drs revenue  which has higher margins 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits  development  marketing and advertising costs  legal and professional fees  communications costs  depreciation and amortization of tangible fixed assets and software  real and personal property leases  as well as other general corporate expenses

these factors were partially offset by million used for the purchase of equipment and capitalized it costs and million used for acquisitions 
portions of our cash and cash equivalents are held in our foreign subsidiaries 
we may not repatriate these funds without significant tax implications

in january  our board of directors adopted a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
through march   a total of  shares had been repurchased under this plan at an average price of per share and  shares remained available for purchase 
no shares were repurchased in fiscal in may  our board of directors authorized a new one year share repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding common stock 
common stock repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or through privately negotiated transactions

table of contents contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of march  follows in thousands payments due by fiscal period contractual obligations total and and and beyond operating lease obligations purchase obligations program supplier guarantees critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the products or services have been delivered  for units released within our he division  we believe this condition is met when the film is complete and  in accordance with the terms of the arrangement  has been delivered or is available for immediate and unconditional delivery  the license period has begun which is referred to as the street date for a product  the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the arrangement fee is reasonably assured based on our collection history 
within our he division  our agreements generally provide for an initial order processing fee and continuing transaction fees based on a percentage of rental revenue earned by the retailers upon renting the units to their customers 
initial order processing fees cover the direct costs of accessing units from program suppliers and handling  packaging and shipping of the units to the retailer 
once the units are shipped  we have no further obligation to provide services to the retailer 
we recognize order processing fees as revenue on the street date and recognize transaction fees when the units are rented to the consumers  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
certain arrangements include guaranteed minimum revenue from our customers as well as our suppliers  which vary by studio and relate to single films  typically major motion picture releases 
these guarantees  which totaled million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal  and  are contractually fixed on the street date and are nonrefundable 
we follow accounting standards codification  which applies to the entertainment films industry  and requires that the entire amount of these minimum guarantees be recognized as revenue  along with the corresponding cost  on the street date  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into a long term agreement with a customer supplier relating to our essentials line of business  in which we developed reporting tools specifically relating to its unique business requirements 
we recognized revenue applying the completed contract method and  accordingly  we recognized the revenue and related costs when the development project was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 
table of contents we recognize other services revenue  including drs revenue in our he division  and business information services revenue in our ami division  ratably over the period of service 
revenue related to custom work projects is recognized upon delivery and acceptance by the customer 
accounts and notes receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable by monitoring past due balances 
if it is determined that a customer may be unable to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is established based on the amount we expect to recover 
an additional general reserve is provided based on aging of accounts receivable and our historical collection experience 
if circumstances change related to specific customers  overall aging of accounts receivable or collection experience  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could materially change 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million at both march  and see also schedule ii  valuation and qualifying accounts included in item of this annual report on form k 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets arise from the tax benefit of amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes but not yet deducted for tax purposes and from unutilized tax credits and net operating loss carry forwards 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
to the extent it is determined the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we will record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
as of march  and  we had a valuation allowance of  and  respectively  recorded against our net operating and capital loss carryforwards in various state and foreign jurisdictions 
net deferred tax assets totaled million as of march  and net deferred tax liabilities totaled million as of march  accounting for unrecognized tax benefits we record a benefit for uncertain tax positions only when we determine that those tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
as of march  and  the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was million and million  respectively  including penalties and interest of  and  respectively 
all unrecognized tax benefits at march  would affect the effective tax rate if recognized 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
capitalized software capitalized software  which is included in property and equipment  net  consists of costs to purchase and develop internal use software  as well as costs to develop internal software  which is used by us to provide various services to clients 
the internal and external costs to develop the internal software used to support these services are capitalized after the technological and business feasibility of the project is determined and the preliminary project stage is completed 
we continue to develop our internal software systems in order to expand our service offerings 
once we begin to utilize this software in our products  these costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the software  which is five years from the date of utilization 
capitalized software is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
based on these reviews  we recorded impairment charges of   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
changes in technology could affect our estimate of the useful life of those assets 
capitalized software costs  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million and million at march  and  respectively 
stock based compensation we are required to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards granted to our employees and directors  including employee stock options  deferred stock units dsus  stock appreciation rights sars  stock settled stock appreciation rights ssars and restricted stock units rsus based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date 
we utilize the black scholes valuation model for valuing our stock based awards 

table of contents the use of the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards requires us to make judgments on assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected term and expected volatility over the expected term of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of expense could be materially different in the future 
compensation expense is only recognized on awards that ultimately vest and market based awards 
however  we have not reduced the stock based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures because there is no basis for estimating future forfeitures since most unvested options are held by members of senior management and the board of directors 
we update for forfeitures as they occur and recognize any changes to accumulated compensation expense in the period of change 
if actual forfeitures are significant  our results of operations could be materially affected 
stock based compensation agreements with non employees we are required to recognized compensation expense for stock based compensation agreements with non employees based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date and at the end of each reporting period 
we utilize the black scholes valuation model to determine the end of period fair value of these awards and record the cumulative incremental change in value as compensation expense over the life of the award 
marketable securities we classify our marketable securities as available for sale securities and  accordingly  they are marked to market on a quarterly basis  with unrealized gains and losses being excluded from earnings and reflected as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
dividend and interest income is recognized when earned 
realized gains and losses are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and certain intangible assets acquired which have indefinite lives are not subject to amortization 
we test these assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired  based on cash flows and other market valuation methods 
we amortize intangible assets with definite lives over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method and evaluate for impairment in accordance with our existing policy impairment of long lived assets  which is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
new accounting guidance see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting guidance 
off balance sheet arrangements other than as disclosed above under contractual payment obligations  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we operate globally and have exposure to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates 
in most markets  we generate revenue and expenses in local currencies 
foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities statements of operations and balance sheets from functional currency to our reporting currency the united states dollar for consolidation purposes 
our most significant foreign currency risks relate to the euro  the british pound and the canadian dollar 
we have evaluated and assessed the potential effect of this risk and concluded that near term changes in currency rates should not materially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
for example  a decrease in the value of foreign currencies in which we operate would have resulted in a  decrease to our operating loss for the year ended march  we have exposure to interest rate risk related to our marketable securities and  to a lesser extent  our cash deposits 
our marketable securities are investments in municipal tax exempt bond funds 
we monitor these accounts regularly and have evaluated and assessed the potential effect of this risk and concluded that near term changes in interest rates should not materially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we classify these investments as available for sale  and have the general intent and ability to hold these investments indefinitely 
unrealized gains and losses on these investments will fluctuate and  historically  have not been significant 
our unrealized loss on these investments as of march  was immaterial
