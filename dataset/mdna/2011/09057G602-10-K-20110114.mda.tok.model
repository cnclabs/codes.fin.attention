item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a national clinical diagnostic laboratory located in northeastern new jersey 
we are a national laboratory in certain focused areas of laboratory testing and a full service laboratory in the new york super region 
we have developed a national reputation for our expertise in certain focused areas of clinical testing 
genpath  the name by which we are known for our cancer and oncology services  is recognized for the superior hematopathology services it provides throughout the country 
our women s health initiative  through which we provide dedicated services for obstetrics and gynecology practices  including a unique  technically advanced multiplex process for identifying sexually transmitted infections  is also offered as genpath 
our regional footprint lays within the new york city metropolitan area and the surrounding areas of new jersey and southern new york state as well eastern pennsylvania and some areas of western connecticut  we also provide services further into new york state  pennsylvania  delaware and maryland 
as a regional provider  we are a full service laboratory that primarily services physician office practices  our drivers pick up samples and deliver reports and supplies  we provide sophisticated technical support  phlebotomy services or patient service centers where appropriate  and electronic communication services in many cases 
physicians outside of our regional footprint send samples to our laboratory in order to take advantage of the expertise that we are able to provide in blood based cancer pathology and associated diagnostics or to take advantage of the superior service  support and technologically advanced testing we offer in our women s health initiative 
our correctional healthcare services are used throughout the country at prisons and jails 
the focused markets we serve on a national basis outside of our regional footprint do not require many of the logistical and other ancillary support services required within the region 
even within our regional footprint  we provide the same services that we provide on a national basis as well as some regional focused diagnostic services  such as histology and pathology support services  substance abuse testing  fertility testing  hemostasis testing  women s health testing  and molecular diagnostics that are unavailable from many of the smaller regional competitors  testing in some of these areas may be provided outside of physician offices 
over the last few years  there have been fundamental changes in the laboratory services industry 
in the s  the industry was negatively impacted by the growth of managed care  increased government regulation  and investigations into fraud and abuse 
these factors led to revenue and profit declines and industry consolidations  especially among commercial laboratories 
there are currently only three us publicly traded full service laboratories operating in the us while that means that the two national mega laboratories and bioreference laboratories are the only remaining publicly traded full service commercial laboratories  there are numerous hospital outreach programs and smaller reference laboratories that compete for the commercial clinical laboratory business scattered throughout the country 
clinical laboratories have had to improve efficiency  leverage economies of scale  comply with government regulations and other laws and develop more profitable approaches to pricing 
moreover  there has been a proliferation of technology advancements in clinical diagnostics over the last decade that has created significant opportunities for new testing and growth 
as a full service clinical laboratory  we are constantly looking for new technologies and new methodologies that will help us to grow 
since the turn of the century  our size alone has made us attractive to companies that are driving the advances in technology 
we represent a significant opportunity for these companies to market their products with a nationally recognized specialty provider in our focused areas of specialty or in one of the major population centers of the world the new york metropolitan area 
we have had several successful strategic relationships with such technology opportunities 
in addition to new technology opportunities  we have an extremely seasoned and talented management staff that has been able to identify emerging laboratory markets that are under served or under utilized 
we have recently developed programs for cardiology  histology and women s health to go along with our existing hemostasis  hematopathology and correctional healthcare initiatives which have already been established and in which we have been increasing our market share for the past several years 
we are currently preparing to launch a comprehensive pre natal program to leverage our presence in the women s health environment and we will continue to vigilantly seek focused diagnostic marketing opportunities where we can provide information  technology  service or support that expand and grow our clinical laboratory 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company acquired the operating assets of genedx  a leading dna sequencing laboratory 
as molecular testing in general becomes a more significant element in the diagnostic testing industry  the company believes that genetic testing will become an essential diagnostic tool of the future 
genedx was started by two geneticists from the national institute of health nih in over the next six years  based on the reputation and expertise of the founders and the outstanding team they built around themselves  along with a very focused and dedicated understanding of the science of genetics  genedx became known as one of the premier genetic testing laboratories for the diagnosis of rare genetic diseases 
the company believed that the promise of genetic testing is in the diagnosis of the genetic variants of common diseases 
it has been the company s intention to leverage the expertise and reputation of genedx in order to take a leadership role in the expanding area of genetic testing 
the company is seeking cutting edge methods of testing that will be commercially viable diagnostic tools for the advancement of genetic testing 
in  genedx introduced genomedx  a then new test based on cgh array technology  a high speed  chip based technology that has allowed genedx to move to the forefront of an emerging technology platform 
in  genedx became the first commercial laboratory in the world to offer next generation nextgen sequencing high speed computer based whole genome sequencing and has since built up a comprehensive suite of cardiac arrhythmia panels  as well as other multi gene testing panels  that have enhanced its reputation as a technology and service leader in the area of genetic testing 
the company is already expanding the menu of tests offered and employing marketing techniques that were extremely successful in building genpath  our oncology laboratory 
in addition to scientists and technicians to manage testing  genedx employs many genetic counselors and geneticists to help patients and referring physicians and geneticists understand the meaning of the test results 
prior to the acquisition  genedx s revenues and profits were increasing at an accelerating rate 
this increase has continued through fiscal while we recognize that we are a clinical laboratory that processes samples  we also understand that we are an information company that needs to effectively communicate the results of our efforts back to healthcare providers 
laboratory results play a major role in the implementation of physician healthcare 
laboratory results are used to diagnose  monitor and classify health concerns 
in many cases  laboratory results represent the confirming data in diagnosing complicated health issues 
since laboratory results play such an important role in routine physician care  we have developed informatics solutions that leverage our role in healthcare 
we needed to build a web based solution to quickly  accurately  conveniently and competitively collect ordering information and deliver results  so we built an internal solution that we call careevolve 
that solution has been essential to our own operations 
we license the technology to other laboratories throughout the country that they utilize to more effectively compete against the national laboratories 
these other laboratories licensing our technology are typically not our competitors since they are outside our regional footprint 
we have also created our psimedica business unit that has developed a clinical knowledge management ckm system that takes data from enrollment  claims  pharmacy  laboratory results and any other available electronic source to provide both administrative and clinical analysis of a population 
the system uses proprietary algorithms to cleanse and configure the data and transfer the resulting information into a healthcare data repository 
using advanced cube technology methodologies  the data can be analyzed from a myriad of views and from highly granular transactional detail to global trended overview 
events such as the katrina disaster in louisiana and general pressures from the government have made development of an electronic medical record system and pay for performance reimbursement priority goals in the healthcare industry 
a large portion of an individual s medical record consists of laboratory data and a key performance indicator in any pay for performance initiative is laboratory result data 
our ckm system is a mature  full functioning solution that will allow us to play a role in these important national initiatives 
to date  neither our psimedica business unit nor careevolve has produced significant revenues 
summary during the quarter ended january   the company executed a restitution agreement with john littleton  a former vice president in sales 
mr 
littleton paid the company  for payments made to him and others that were from our perspective  improperly paid 
these payments were paid for a recruiting fees for new hires paid to parties with an undisclosed relationship to him and b reimbursement to him or others of improperly or insufficiently documented expenses  both of which are in violation of the company s policies see other income in table below 
as such  in certain areas within the management s discussion and analysis we will present an analysis of our operating results including the restitution amount and pro forma operating results excluding the restitution amount it will be labeled as such 
figures in thousands except per share data fiscal year ended october  pro forma net revenues cost of services gross profit on revenues general and administrative expenses operating income other income expense  net income before taxes taxes net income income per share basic number of shares basic income per share diluted number of shares diluted results of operations in thousands  except per patient data fiscal year compared to net revenues net revenues for the year ended october  were  as compared to  for the year ended october   this represents a increase in net revenues 
this increase is due to a increase in patients serviced and a increase in net revenue per patient 
our laboratory operations had net revenues of  in fiscal and  in fiscal the number of patients serviced during the year ended october  was  which was greater when compared to the prior fiscal year 
net revenue per patient for the year ended october  was compared to net revenue per patient for the year ended october  of  an increase of or as a result of increases in esoteric testing 
cost of services cost of services for the year ended october  was  as compared to  for the year ended october   an increase of as compared to a increase in net revenues 
therefore  this increase is basically in line with the increase in net revenues 
gross profit gross profit on net revenues increased to  for the year ended october  from  for the year ended october   an increase of   primarily attributable to the increase in net revenues 
gross profit margins remained constant year over year at general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended october  were  as compared to  for the year ended october   an increase of  or 
this is basically in line with the increase in net revenues 
interest expense interest expense increased from  during the year ended october  to  during the year ended october   an increase of this increase is due to an increase in utilization of the pnc bank line of credit  acquisition debt and capital leases 
management believes that this trend will continue in the near term due to the increase in utilization rates 
net income we realized net income of  for the twelve month period ended october  as compared to  for the twelve month period ended october   an increase of 
pre tax income for the period ended october  was  as compared to  for the period ended october   an increase of  and was caused primarily by an increase in net revenues 
the provision for income taxes increased from  for the period ended october   to  for the current twelve month period 
the most profound change would have been that our fully diluted earnings per share eps went from in fiscal under the pro forma basis without taking into account the restitution agreement to in fiscal under the current operating results  a difference of 
per share  which is more reflective of our true operating results 
results of operations in thousands  except per patient data fiscal year compared to net revenues net revenues for the year ended october  were  as compared to  for the year ended october   this represents a increase in net revenues 
this increase is due to a increase in patients serviced and a increase in net revenue per patient 
our laboratory operations had net revenues of  in fiscal the number of patients serviced during the year ended october  was  which was greater when compared to the prior fiscal year

cost of services cost of services for the year ended october  was  as compared to  for the year ended october   an increase of as compared to a increase in net revenues 
therefore  this increase is in line with the increase in net revenues 
gross profit gross profit on net revenues increased to  for the year ended october  from  for the year ended october   an increase of   primarily attributable to the increase in net revenues 
gross profit margins remained constant year over year at general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended october  were  as compared to  for the year ended october   an increase of  or 
this increase is less than the increase in net revenues and includes moderate increases to our marketing and sales expenses 
interest expense interest expense decreased from  during the year ended october  to  during the year ended october   a decrease of this decrease is due to a decrease in utilization and in the interest rates on the pnc bank line of credit  acquisition debt and capital leases 
management believes that this trend will continue in the near term due to the decrease in interest rates 
net income we realized net income of  for the twelve month period ended october  as compared to  for the twelve month period ended october   an increase of 
pre tax income for the period ended october  was  as compared to  for the period ended october   an increase of  and was caused primarily by an increase in net revenues 
the provision for income taxes increased from  for the period ended october   to  for the current twelve month period 
the most profound change on a pro forma basis would have been that our fully diluted earnings per share eps went from under then current operating results to on a pro forma basis  a difference of 
per share  which is more reflective of our true operating results 
results of operations in thousands  except per patient data liquidity and capital resources dollars in thousands for the fiscal year ended october  our working capital at october  was approximately  as compared to approximately  at october   an increase of  our cash position increased by approximately during the current period 
we increased our short term borrowing by approximately  and repaid approximately  in existing debt 
we had current liabilities of approximately  at october  we generated approximately  in cash from operations  a decrease of approximately  as compared to the year ended october  this decrease is basically in line with an increase in our accounts receivable associated with an increase in revenues 
accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  totaled approximately  at october   an increase of approximately  from october   or 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased revenue 
cash collected over the twelve month period ended october  increased over the prior twelve month period 
net service revenues on the statements of operations are as follows years ended october gross revenues contractual adjustments and discounts net revenues percent of contractual adjustments and discounts to gross revenues the table above illustrates the relationship between contractual adjustments and gross revenues for the fiscal years   and between and  contractual adjustments increased approximately basis points 
credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally diversified due to the large number of patients comprising our client base 
we have significant receivable balances with government payors and various insurance carriers 
generally  we do not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables 
however  we continually monitor and evaluate our client acceptance and collection procedures to minimize potential credit risks associated with our accounts receivable and to establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
as a consequence  we believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure beyond such allowance is not material to the financial statements 
a number of proposals for legislation continue to be under discussion which could substantially reduce medicare and medicaid reimbursements to clinical laboratories 
depending upon the nature of regulatory action  and the content of legislation  we could experience a significant decrease in revenues from medicare and medicaid  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are unable to predict  however  the extent to which such actions will be taken 
laboratory gross receivables by payor group fy days days days days total self pay medicare medicaid pro bill comm 
ins total fy days days days days total self pay medicare medicaid pro bill comm 
ins total billing for laboratory services is complicated and we must bill various payors  such as the individual  the insurance company  the government federal or state  the private company or the health clinic 
other factors that may complicate billing include differences between fee schedules and reimbursement rates 
incomplete or inaccurate billing information as provided by the physician 
disparity in coverage and information requirements 
disputes with payors 
internal and external compliance policies and procedures 
significant costs are incurred as a result of our participation in government programs since billing and reimbursement for laboratory tests are subject to complex regulations 
we perform the requested tests and report the results whether the information is correct or not or even missing 
this adds to the complexity and slows the collection process and increases the aging of our accounts receivable a r 
when patient invoices are not collected in a timely manner the item is written off to the allowance 
days sales outstanding dso for fiscal years and were and  respectively  a decrease of approximately 
these changes are due to constant vigilance on the part of management and internal changes to collection practices 
however  when you compare our dso lag to our collectible net revenues as reported on our financial statements for the periods in question  it varies between to  depending on the period 
overall  the components of a r as shown above for the two most recently completed fiscal years under review have not varied much year over year 
the percent of a r over days has increased to as of october  as compared to as of october  see note to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding outstanding loans

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
accounting for goodwill we evaluate the recoverability and measure the possible impairment of goodwill under fasb codification goodwill 
the impairment test is a two step process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
the first step screens for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
management s estimate of fair value considers publicly available information regarding our market capitalization as well as i publicly available information regarding comparable publicly traded companies in the clinical laboratory testing industry  ii the financial projections and future prospects of our business  including its growth opportunities and likely operational improvements  and iii comparable sales prices  if available 
as part of the first step to assess potential impairment  management compares the estimate of fair value to book value on a consolidated net assets basis 
if the book value of the consolidated net assets is greater than the estimate of fair value  we then proceed to the second step to measure the impairment  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying value the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater than its implied fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized in that period 
accounting for intangible and other long lived assets we evaluate the possible impairment of our long lived assets  including intangible assets 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
evaluation of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the asset from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations 
if the expected undiscounted pretax cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the asset 
accounting for revenue service revenues are principally generated from laboratory testing services including chemical diagnostic tests such as blood analysis  urine analysis and genetic testing among others 
net service revenues are recognized at the time the testing services are performed and are reported at their estimated net realizable amounts 
these estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors and others for services rendered  are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in subsequent periods based upon an analysis of the company s collection experience from each category of payor group as well as prospectively determined contractual adjustments and discounts with third party payors 
differences between these adjustments and any subsequent revisions are included in the statement of operations in which the revisions are made and are disclosed  if material 
applying this methodology and aggregating its collection experience from all payor groups  the company has not been required to record an adjustment related to revenue recorded in prior periods that was material in nature 
accounting for contractual credits and doubtful accounts an allowance for contractual credits and discounts is estimated by payor group and determined based upon a review of the reimbursement policies and subsequent collections from the different types of payors 
the company has not been required to record an adjustment in a subsequent period related to revenue recorded in a prior period that was material in nature 
accounting for employment benefit plan see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on employment benefit plans 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains historical information as well as forward looking statements 
statements looking forward in time are included in this annual report pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results in future periods to be materially different from any future performance suggested herein 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while many aspects of our business are subject to complex federal  state and local regulations  the accounting for our business is generally straightforward 
our revenues are primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low dollar transactions  and about of all our costs consist of employee compensation and benefits 
revenues are recognized at the time the services are performed and are reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors and others for services rendered including prospectively determined adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third party payors 
these adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined 
these estimates are reviewed and adjusted  if warranted  by senior management on a monthly basis 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are correct  however  several factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors in addition to those discussed under risk factors as well as elsewhere herein including our failure to integrate newly acquired businesses if any and the costs related to such integration 
our failure to obtain and retain new customers and alliance partners  or a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers 
adverse results from investigations of clinical laboratories by the government  which may include significant monetary damages and or exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under  or future changes in  the law or regulations of clia  or those of medicare  medicaid or other federal  state or local agencies 
changes in federal  state  local and third party payor regulations or policies or in the interpretation of current regulations affecting governmental and third party reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing such as the decrease in medicare reimbursement for flow cytometry testing at the beginning of calendar year described above under risk factors 
failure to comply with the federal occupational safety and health administration requirements and the recently passed needlestick safety and prevention act 
failure to comply with hipaa  which could result in significant fines as well as substantial criminal penalties 
changes in payor mix 
failure to maintain our days sales outstanding levels 
increased competition  including price competition 
our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 
adverse litigation results 
liabilities that result from our inability to comply with new corporate governance requirements 
failure to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not invest in or trade market risk sensitive instruments 
we also do not have any material foreign operations or foreign sales so that our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is practically non existent 
we do have exposure to both rising and falling interest rates 
at october   advances of approximately  under our loan agreement with pnc bank were subject to interest charges at the bank s then prime rate of 
we estimate that our monthly cash interest expense at october  was approximately  and that a one percentage point increase or decrease in short term rates would increase or decrease our monthly interest expense by approximately  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein for information on the company s loans
