item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based on consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported results 
the company uses estimates based on the best information available in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations 
estimates are used for such items as collectibility of trade accounts receivable and inventory valuation 
ultimate results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts through review of open accounts  and historical collection and allowances amounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to reduce trade accounts receivable to the amount that reasonably approximates their net realizable value 
the amount ultimately realized from trade accounts receivable may differ from the amount estimated in the consolidated financial statements based on collection experience 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
a portion of our finished goods inventory is made to order and many of our raw material parts are interchangeable between products 
management assesses the inventory on hand and if necessary writes down the obsolete or excess inventory to market 
revenue recognition is upon delivery of product to our customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery of product to our customer is evidenced through the shipping terms indicating when title and risk of loss is transferred 
our ordering process creates persuasive evidence of the sale arrangement and the sales amount is determined 
the delivery of the goods to our customer completes the earnings process 
net sales consist of product sales and related delivery charge revenue  net of adjustments for returns and allowances 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold

outlook we had modest gains in sales for the current year over the prior year partially due to a strong backlog entering the year 
we enter fiscal year with lower backlogs and anticipate that first quarter fiscal year sales will be lower than first quarter fiscal year macroeconomic conditions  such as  high unemployment  minimal job growth  a weak housing market and low levels of consumer confidence continue to adversely impact our business 
the macroeconomic environment tempers expectations of top line growth through the first part of fiscal year the commercial office industry is reporting improving order trends 
while we have benefited minimally from those improvements to date  we believe we will see increased sales volume during fiscal year we anticipate increased orders for hospitality products during fiscal year resulting from pent up demand caused by delays in typical refurbishing cycles for hotel properties 
we remain committed to our core strategies  which include a wide range of quality product offerings and price points to the residential and commercial markets  combined with a conservative approach to business 
we will maintain our focus on a strong balance sheet through emphasis on cash flow and improving profitability 
we believe these core strategies are in the best interest of our shareholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
as discussed below  management of the company does not believe that changes in these factors could cause material fluctuations in the company s results of operations or cash flows 
the ability to import furniture products can be adversely affected by political issues in the countries where suppliers are located  disruptions associated with shipping distances and negotiations with port employees 
other risks related to furniture product importation include government imposition of regulations and or quotas  duties and taxes on imports  and significant fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies 
any of these factors could interrupt supply  increase costs and decrease earnings 
inflation increased operating costs are reflected in product or services pricing with any limitations on price increases determined by the marketplace 
inflation or other pricing pressures could impact raw material costs  labor costs and interest rates which are important components of costs for the company and could have an adverse effect on our profitability  especially where increases in these costs exceed price increases on finished products 
foreign currency risk during fiscal years  and  the company did not have sales  purchases  or other expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
as such  the company is not directly exposed to market risk associated with currency exchange rates and prices 
interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is changes in interest rates 
at june   the company does not have any debt outstanding
