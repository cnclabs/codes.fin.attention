overview compass diversified holdings  a delaware statutory trust  was incorporated in delaware on november  compass group diversified holdings  llc  a delaware limited liability company  was also formed on november  in accordance with the trust agreement  the trust is sole owner of of the trust interests as defined in the llc agreement of the company and  pursuant to the llc agreement  the company has outstanding  the identical number of trust interests as the number of outstanding shares of the trust 
the manager is the sole owner of the allocation interests of the company 
the company is the operating entity with a board of directors and other corporate governance responsibilities  similar to that of a delaware corporation 
the trust and the company were formed to acquire and manage a group of small and middle market businesses headquartered in north america 
we characterize small and middle market businesses as those that generate annual cash flows of up to million 
we focus on companies of this size because we believe that these companies are more able to achieve growth rates above those of their relevant industries and are also frequently more susceptible to efforts to improve earnings and cash flow 
in pursuing new acquisitions  we seek businesses with the following characteristics north american base of operations  stable and growing earnings and cash flow  maintains a significant market share in defensible industry niche ie  has a reason to exist  solid and proven management team with meaningful incentives  low technological and or product obsolescence risk  and a diversified customer and supplier base 
our management team s strategy for our subsidiaries involves utilizing structured incentive compensation programs tailored to each business in order to attract  recruit and retain talented managers to operate our businesses  regularly monitoring financial and operational performance  instilling consistent financial discipline  and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals  assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic cash flow growth strategies both revenue and cost related  identifying and working with management to execute attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities  and forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives 
based on the experience of our management team and its ability to identify and negotiate acquisitions  we believe we are well positioned to acquire additional attractive businesses 
our management team has a large network of approximately 
table of contents  deal intermediaries to whom it actively markets and who we expect to expose us to potential acquisitions 
through this network  as well as our management team s active proprietary transaction sourcing efforts  we typically have a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition targets 
in consummating transactions  our management team has  in the past  been able to successfully navigate complex situations surrounding acquisitions  including corporate spin offs  transitions of family owned businesses  management buy outs and reorganizations 
we believe the flexibility  creativity  experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions provides us with a strategic advantage by allowing us to consider non traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target 
in addition  because we intend to fund acquisitions through the utilization of our revolving credit facility  we do not expect to be subject to delays in or conditions by closing acquisitions that would be typically associated with transaction specific financing  as is typically the case in such acquisitions 
we believe this advantage is a powerful one and is highly unusual in the marketplace for acquisitions in which we operate

impairment charge we test goodwill at interim dates if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired at any of our reporting units 
as a result  we conducted an interim test for impairment at american furniture based on results of operations which had deteriorated significantly during the second and third quarter of the domestic economy has undergone a significant period of economic uncertainty which has resulted in limited access to credit markets and lower consumer spending 
the retail furniture market has been  and continues to be  severely impacted by these conditions  particularly as it relates to the housing market 
retail furniture sales rely heavily on consumer spending for new furniture when they move into a new home 
the uptick in sales and results of operations that we anticipated at the beginning of this year  which we believed would coincide with the overall modest economic rebound in has not occurred in the furniture industry and we do not at this time believe it will occur in the near future 
accordingly  we adjusted our forecast for american furniture to reflect a revised outlook assuming continued pressure on sales and gross margins in the furniture industry 
the revised forecast  which is used to populate a discounted cash flow analysis  led to the conclusion that it was more likely than not that the fair value of american furniture was below its carrying amount 
based on the results of our interim impairment tests which is a two step process  we determined that the carrying value of american furniture s goodwill exceeded its fair value by approximately million 
in addition  based on the results of the second step of the analysis we determined that the carrying value of american furniture s trade name exceeded its fair value by approximately million 
as a result of these shortfalls  we recorded a million impairment charge  which is reflected in our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  distributions for the fiscal year we declared distributions to our shareholders totaling per share 
areas for focus in the areas of focus for  which are generally applicable to each of our businesses  include taking advantage  where possible  of the recent economic downturn by growing market share in each of our market niche leading companies at the expense of less well capitalized competitors  achieving sales growth  technological excellence and manufacturing capability through global expansion  continuing to grow through disciplined  strategic acquisitions and rigorous integration processes  continue to pursue expense reduction and cost savings through contraction in discretionary spending  and reductions in workforce and production levels in response to lower production volume  and driving free cash flow through increased net income and effective working capital management enabling continued investment in our businesses  strategic acquisitions  and enabling us to return value to our shareholders

table of contents impairment test at american furniture  we determined that the carrying value of american furniture goodwill exceeded its fair value by approximately million 
as a result of this shortfall  we recorded a million pretax goodwill impairment charge 
the remaining million charge reflects a write down of the unamortized american furniture trade name to its fair value 
based on the results of our annual impairment tests performed as of march  an indication of impairment existed at the staffmark reporting unit 
in each of our other businesses reporting units the result of the annual goodwill impairment test indicated that the fair value of the business exceeded its carrying value 
based on the results of the second step of the impairment test at staffmark  we estimated that the carrying value of staffmark goodwill exceeded its fair value by approximately million 
as a result of this shortfall  we recorded a million pretax goodwill impairment charge for in connection with the annual goodwill impairment tests  we tested other indefinite lived intangible assets at our staffmark reporting unit 
as a result of this analysis we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the cbs personnel trade name  based principally on the discontinuance of the use of the cbs personnel trade name and rebranding of the reporting units business to staffmark beginning in february during  we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately million at the corporate level to decrease the carrying value of the cbs personnel trade name to its fair value 
the results of the annual impairment tests performed as of april  indicated that the fair values of the reporting units businesses exceeded their carrying values and  therefore goodwill was not impaired 
accordingly  there were no charges for goodwill impairment in results of operations our businesses as previously discussed  we acquired our businesses on various acquisition dates beginning may  see table above

table of contents cash flows of certain of our businesses are seasonal in nature 
cash flows from american furniture are typically highest in the months of january through april of each year  coinciding with homeowners tax refunds 
cash flows from staffmark are typically lower in the first quarter of each year than in other quarters due to reduced seasonal demand for temporary staffing services and to lower gross margins during that period associated with the front end loading of certain taxes and other payments associated with payroll paid to our employees 
cash flows from halo are typically highest in the months of september through december of each year primarily as the result of calendar sales and holiday promotions 
halo generates approximately two thirds of its operating income in the months of september through december 
revenue and earnings from fox are typically highest in the third quarter  coinciding with the delivery of product for the new bike year

table of contents critical accounting estimates the following discussion relates to critical accounting policies for the company  the trust and each of our businesses 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap will require management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different conditions 
our critical accounting estimates are discussed below 
these critical accounting estimates are reviewed by our independent auditors and the audit committee of our board of directors 
supplemental put agreement in connection with our management services agreement  we entered into a supplemental put agreement with our manager pursuant to which our manager has the right to cause the company to purchase the allocation interests then owned by our manager upon termination of the management services agreement for a price to be determined in accordance with the supplemental put agreement 
the fair value of the supplemental put is determined using a model that multiplies the trailing twelve month earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for each reporting unit by an estimated enterprise value multiple to determine an estimated selling price of that reporting unit 
we then deduct estimated selling and disposal costs in arriving at a net estimated selling price that is then input into an iterative supplemental put calculation which takes into account  among other things  contractually defined cumulative contribution based profit in order to arrive at the estimated manager s profit allocation accrual required  reflected on the balance sheet as the supplemental put liability 
we review the model quarterly and make updates to ebitda and cumulative contribution based profit 
when appropriate we may change the estimated enterprise value multiple if the market for the particular reporting unit has changed 
we review the model and assumptions with our manager each quarter 
since some of our manager s functions are to i identify  evaluate  manage  perform due diligence on  negotiate and oversee the acquisitions of target businesses by us and ii evaluate  manage  negotiate and oversee the disposition of all or any part of our property  assets or investments  including dispositions of all or any part of our reporting units  we feel that our manager is particularly skilled at reviewing and commenting on this data 
annually  we prepare a detailed analysis of the estimated enterprise value multiple for each of our reporting units  which is one of the primary drivers used to calculate the estimated selling price 
in addition  annually  we engage an independent investment banking firm to review the estimated enterprise value multiple for reasonableness taking into account comparable company data  comparable transactions and discounted cash flow analyses dcf 
the methodology and results employed in the market approach for goodwill impairment testing for each of our reporting units is most similar to the methodology and results reflected in calculating the estimated selling price of each of our reporting units for the purpose of estimating the fair value of the supplemental put 
we typically assign a higher weighting to the market approach as opposed to the dcf in calculating the estimated selling price of the reporting units for the purpose of estimating the fair value of the supplemental put than we do for estimating the fair value of our reporting units for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing  which accounts for the major differences in value 
the higher weighting is based on the premise that because the manager can unilaterally resign  the company will be required to remit the profit allocation supplemental put value as of a specific point in time 
this one sided put on behalf of the manager is the principle reason that we are required to reflect this liability on our balance sheet 
the impact of over estimating or under estimating the value of the supplemental put agreement could have a material effect on operating results 
in addition  the value of the supplemental put agreement is subject to the volatility of our operations which may result in significant fluctuation in the value assigned to this supplemental put agreement 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
provisions for customer returns and other allowances based on historical experience are recognized at the time the related sale is recognized 
staffmark recognizes revenue for temporary staffing services at the time services are provided by staffmark employees and reports revenue based on gross billings to customers 
revenue from staffmark employee leasing services is recorded at the time services are provided 
such revenue is reported on a net basis gross billings to clients less worksite employee 
table of contents salaries  wages and payroll related taxes 
we believe that net revenue accounting for leasing services more closely depicts the transactions with its leasing customers and is consistent with guidelines outlined in authoritative guidance 
the effect of using this method of accounting is to report lower revenue than would be otherwise reported 
business combinations the acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder  if any  to be recorded as identifiable intangibles or goodwill 
the fair values are determined by our management team  taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and other relevant information 
such information typically includes valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts for significant business combinations 
the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
the determination of fair values requires significant judgment both by our management team and by outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
this judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to amortizable or depreciable assets 
the impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and or depreciation expense 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired 
we are required to perform impairment reviews at least annually and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining certain assumptions used in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each of our reporting units based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecast and a market approach which compares peer data and multiples 
we then compare those estimated fair values with the carrying values  which include allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is then compared to its corresponding carrying value 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and or intangible assets 
such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  and material adverse effects in relationships with significant customers 
we determine fair values for each of our reporting units using both the income and market approach 
for purposes of the income approach  fair value was determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate 
we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long term outlook for each business 
discount rates are derived by applying market derived inputs and analyzing published rates for industries comparable to our reporting units 
we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the financial markets generally and in the internally developed forecasts 
discount rates used in these reporting unit valuations ranged from approximately to in our most recent annual impairment reviews 
valuations using the market approach reflect prices and other relevant observable information generated by market transactions involving businesses comparable to our reporting units 
we assess the valuation methodologies under the market approach based upon the relevance and availability of data at the time of performing the valuation and weigh the methodologies appropriately 
the impact of over estimating or under estimating the implied fair value of goodwill at any of our reporting units could have a material effect on our operating results 
in addition  the value of the implied goodwill is subject to the volatility of our operations which may result in significant fluctuation in the value assigned at a point in time 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of march  at each of our reporting units  the units fair value exceeded its carrying value 
we test goodwill at interim dates if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired at any of our reporting units 
as a result  we conducted an interim test for impairment at american furniture as of september   which was triggered based on results of operations at the reporting unit which had deteriorated significantly during the second and third quarter of the domestic economy has undergone a significant period of economic uncertainty which has resulted in limited access to credit markets and lower consumer spending 
the retail furniture market has been  and continues to be  severely impacted by these conditions  particularly as it relates to the housing market 
retail furniture sales rely heavily on consumer spending for new furniture when they move into a new home 
the uptick in sales and results of operations that we anticipated at the beginning of this year  which we believed would coincide with the overall modest economic rebound  has not occurred in the furniture industry and we do not at this time believe it will occur in the near future 
accordingly  we adjusted our forecast for american furniture to reflect a 
table of contents revised outlook assuming continued pressure on sales and gross margins in the furniture industry 
the revised forecast  which is used to populate a discounted cash flow analysis  led to the conclusion that it was more likely than not that the fair value of american furniture was below its carrying amount 
the carrying value of american furniture exceeded its fair value at september  due primarily to the significant decrease in revenue and operating profit together with management s revised outlook on near term operating results 
as a result  we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test in order to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involved comparing the implied fair value of american furniture s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
this comparison resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of million  which was recorded in impairment expense on the consolidated statement of operations 
the balance of goodwill subsequent to the impairment charge remaining on the balance sheet of american furniture at december  is million 
further  the results of this analysis indicated that the carrying value of american furniture s trade name exceeded its fair value by approximately million 
the fair value of the american furniture trade name was determined by applying the relief from royalty technique to forecasted revenues at the american furniture reporting unit 
as of december   no indications of impairment exist at any of our reporting units and we do not believe that any of our reporting units is at risk of failing step one of the annual goodwill impairment test performed march of each year 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of march  at each of our reporting units  the units fair value exceeded carrying value with the exception of staffmark 
the carrying amount of staffmark exceeded its fair value due primarily to the significant decrease in revenue and operating profit at staffmark resulting from the negative impact on temporary staffing and permanent placement revenues due to macroeconomic conditions and downward employment trends experienced in and as a result  we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test in order to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involved comparing the implied fair value of staffmark s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
this comparison resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of million  which was recorded in impairment expense on the consolidated statement of operations 
in connection with the annual goodwill impairment testing  we tested other indefinite lived intangible assets at our staffmark reporting unit 
as a result of this analysis we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the cbs personnel trade name an indefinite lived asset  based principally on the discontinuance of the cbs personnel trade name and rebranding of the reporting unit to staffmark in february the fair value of the cbs personnel trade name was determined by applying the relief from royalty technique to forecasted revenues at the staffmark reporting unit 
the result of this analysis indicated that the carrying value of the trade name million exceeded its fair value million by million 
therefore  an impairment charge of million is recorded in impairment expense on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the remaining balance million of the cbs personnel trade name is being amortized over years 
see footnote g to our consolidated financial statements 
long lived intangible assets subject to amortization  including customer relationships  non compete agreements and technology are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets  which we determine based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
we evaluate the carrying value and remaining useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization whenever indications of impairment are present 
the determination of fair values and estimated useful lives requires significant judgment both by our management team and by outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
this judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to our reporting units and intangible assets 
the impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and or the incurrence of an impairment charge allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts on an entity by entity basis with consideration for historical loss experience  customer payment patterns and current economic trends 
the company reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a periodic basis and adjusts the balance  if necessary 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant judgment by management 
the impact of either over or under estimating the allowance could have a material effect on future operating results 
workers compensation liability staffmark is an employer with both self insurance and large deductible plans for its workers compensation exposure 
staffmark establishes reserves based upon its experience and expectations as to its ultimate liability for those claims using 
table of contents developmental factors based upon historical claim experience 
staffmark continually evaluates the potential for change in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries 
as of december   staffmark had approximately million in workers compensation liability related to claims  reserves and settlements 
the ultimate settlement of this liability could differ materially from the assumptions used to calculate this liability  which could have a material adverse effect on future operating results 
deferred tax assets several of our majority owned subsidiaries have deferred tax assets recorded at december  which in total amount to approximately million 
these deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of reserves not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the temporary differences that have resulted in the recording of these tax assets may be used to offset taxable income in future periods  reducing the amount of taxes we might otherwise be required to pay 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income 
based upon the expected future results of operations  we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of existing temporary differences  although there can be no assurance of this 
the impact of not realizing these deferred tax assets would result in an increase in income tax expense for such period when the determination was made that the assets are not realizable 
see note k income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements recent accounting pronouncements refer to footnote b to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity at december   we were exposed to interest rate risk primarily through borrowings under our credit agreement because borrowings under this agreement are subject to variable interest rates 
we had outstanding million under the term loan facility and million outstanding under the revolving credit facility portions of our credit agreement at december  our exposure to fluctuation in variable interest on the outstanding balances of our term and revolving debt is not deemed to be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
we expect to borrow under our revolving credit facility in the future in order to finance our short term working capital needs and future acquisitions 
exchange rate sensitivity at december   we were not exposed to significant foreign currency exchange rate risks that could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk associated with cash equivalents  investments  and trade receivables 
we do not believe that our cash equivalents or investments present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the instruments consist of major financial institutions and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty 
our cash and cash equivalents at december  consists principally of i treasury backed securities  ii insured prime money market funds  iii fdic insured certificates of deposit  and iv cash balances in several non interest bearing checking accounts 
substantially all trade receivable balances of our businesses are unsecured 
the concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited by the large number of customers in our customer base and their dispersion across various industries and geographic areas 
although we have a large number of customers who are dispersed across different industries and geographic areas  a prolonged economic downturn could increase our exposure to credit risk on our trade receivables 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses
