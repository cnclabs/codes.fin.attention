certain factors affecting results of operations we may experience significant variation in our future results of operations 
these fluctuations may result from numerous factors 
these factors include  among other things  market conditions and the resulting volatility and credit and counterparty risks that may result  introductions of  or enhancements to  trade execution services by us or our competitors  the value of our securities positions and other financial instruments and our ability to manage the risks attendant thereto  the volume of our trade execution activities  the dollar value of securities and other instruments traded  the composition and profile of our order flow  our market share with institutional and broker dealer clients  the performance and size of  and volatility in  our market making and program trading portfolios  the performance of our non client principal trading models  movements of credit spreads  the performance of our global operations  costs associated with our global expansion and domestic growth  the effectiveness of our self clearing platform  our ability to manage personnel  compensation  overhead and other expenses  including our occupancy expenses under our office leases and expenses and charges relating to legal and regulatory proceedings  the strength of our client relationships  changes in payments for order flow  changes to execution quality and changes in clearing  execution and regulatory transaction costs  interest rate movements  the addition or loss of executive management  sales  electronic and voice trading and technology professionals  legislative  legal and regulatory changes  legal and regulatory matters or proceedings  geopolitical risk  the amount  timing and cost of capital expenditures  acquisitions and divestitures  the integration  performance and operation of acquired businesses  the incurrence of costs associated with acquisitions and dispositions  investor sentiment  technological changes and events  seasonality  competition  and market and economic conditions 
such factors may also have an impact on our ability to achieve our strategic objectives  including  without limitation  increases in our market share  growth and profitability in our equities and ficc segments 
if demand for our services declines due to any of the above factors  and we are unable to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of the foregoing factors  period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
there also can be no assurance that we will be able to continue the rates of revenue growth that we have experienced in the past or that we will be able to improve our operating results 
trends global economic trends our businesses are affected by many factors in the global financial markets and worldwide economic conditions 
these factors include the growth level of gross domestic product in the us  europe and asia  and the existence of transparent  efficient and liquid equity and debt markets and level of trading volumes 
global economic activity improved broadly during and volatility across equity markets generally declined 
credit spreads contracted in the us  although spreads in europe were relatively more volatile as european sovereign spreads in certain countries widened 
the improvement in economic conditions was tempered by increases in us interest rates  inflation concerns  and rising commodity prices 

table of contents trends affecting our company we believe that our businesses are affected by the aforementioned global economic trends as well as more specific trends 
some of the specific trends that impact our operations  financial condition and results of operations are broker dealer clients continue to focus on statistics measuring the quality of equity executions including speed of execution and price improvement 
in an effort to improve the quality of their executions as well as increase efficiencies  market makers have increased the level of automation within their operations and the extent of price improvement 
the greater focus on execution quality has resulted in greater competition in the marketplace  which  along with market structure changes and market conditions  has negatively impacted the revenue capture metrics of the company and other market making firms 
equities and ficc transaction volumes executed by broker dealers have fluctuated over the past few years due to retail and institutional investor sentiment  market conditions and a variety of other factors  resulting in a shift of product mix 
equities and ficc transaction volumes may not be sustainable and are not predictable 
in recent years several exchanges have entered into joint ventures with broker dealers to create their own atss and ecns and compete within the otc and listed trading venues 
in addition  there are many new entrants into the market  including ats  multilateral trading facilities  systematic internalizers  dark liquidity pools  high frequency trading firms  and market making firms competing for retail and institutional order flow 
further  many broker dealers are offering their own internal crossing networks 
these factors continue to create further fragmentation and competition in the marketplace 
market structure changes  competition and market conditions have triggered an industry shift toward market makers charging explicit commissions or commission equivalents to institutional clients for executions in otc securities 
for the majority of our institutional client orders  we charge explicit fees in the form of commissions or commission equivalents 
institutional commission rates have fallen in the past few years due to competitive forces and increased electronic trading  and may continue to fall in the future 
market structure changes  competition and technology advancements have also led to a dramatic increase in electronic message traffic 
these increases in message traffic place heavy strains on the technology resources  bandwidth and capacities of market participants 
many institutional clients allocate commissions to broker dealers based on the quality of executions  as well as in exchange for research  or soft dollar and commission recapture programs 
there has been continued scrutiny of the capital markets industry by the regulatory and legislative authorities  both in the us and abroad 
new legislation or new or modified regulations and rules could occur in the future 
members of the us congress have raised various concerns about the regulatory structure of the us capital markets and have asked the sec to take a close look at the regulatory structure and make the changes necessary to insure the rule framework governing the us capital markets is comprehensive and complete 
the sec has stated that it will carefully review  and propose rules where necessary  on a variety of marketplace trading issues including  but not limited to high frequency trading  indications of interest  various forms of off exchange trading  dark liquidity pools  internalization  post trade attribution  co location  and sponsored access 
in addition  the sec has proposed rules dealing with flash orders  indications of interest  ats thresholds  and other market related rules some of which have been finalized 
on july   the dodd frank act was enacted into law marking a significant change to the regulation of the financial services industry 
this legislation will affect nearly all financial 
table of contents institutions that operate in the us as a result  financial institutions must now begin to deal with the historic shift in us banking  securities  derivatives  executive compensation  consumer protection and corporate governance that will grow out of the general framework established by the dodd frank act 
while the weight of the dodd frank act falls more heavily on large  complex financial institutions  smaller institutions will also face a more complicated and expensive regulatory framework 
there continues to be growth in equity electronic trading  as evidenced by increased volumes over the past few years in direct market access platforms  algorithmic and program trading  high frequency trading and ecns and dark liquidity pools 
in addition  electronic trading continues to expand to other asset classes  including options  currencies and fixed income 
the expansion of electronic trading may result in the growth of innovative electronic products and competition for order flow 
the macro economic environment and market conditions have had an adverse impact on the profitability of the institutional customer base  resulting in volatile earnings and decreased volumes 
income statement items the following section briefly describes the key components of  and drivers to  our significant revenues and expenses 
revenues our revenues consist principally of commissions and fees and net trading revenue from our equities and ficc segments 
revenues on transactions for which we charge explicit commissions or commission equivalents  which include the majority of our institutional client orders  are included within commissions and fees
