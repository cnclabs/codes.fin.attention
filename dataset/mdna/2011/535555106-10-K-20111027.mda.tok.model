table of contents overview the company manufactures and markets zimmatic  greenfield  stettyn  and perrot center pivot  lateral move  and hose reel irrigation systems 
the company also produces irrigation controls  chemical injection systems and remote monitoring and control systems which it sells under its growsmart brand 
these products are used by farmers to increase or stabilize crop production while conserving water  energy  and labor 
through its acquisitions  the company has been able to enhance its capabilities in providing innovative  turn key solutions to customers through the integration of its proprietary pump stations  controls and designs 
the company sells its irrigation products primarily to a world wide independent dealer network  who resell to their customer  the farmer 
the company s primary production facilities are located in the united states 
the company has smaller production and sales operations in france  brazil  italy and china as well as distribution and sales operations in south africa  australia and new zealand 
the company also manufactures and markets various infrastructure products  including moveable barriers for traffic lane management  crash cushions  preformed reflective pavement tapes and other road safety devices  through its production facilities in omaha  nebraska  rio vista  california and milan  italy 
in addition  the company s infrastructure segment produces large diameter steel tubing and railroad signals and structures  and provides outsourced manufacturing and production services for other companies 
key factors which impact demand for the company s irrigation products include agricultural commodity prices  net cash farm income  crop yields  weather  environmental regulations  availability of financing and interest rates 
a key factor which impacts demand for the company s infrastructure products is the amount of spending authorized by governments to improve road and highway systems 
much of the us highway infrastructure market is driven by government spending programs 
for example  the us government funds highway and road improvements through the federal highway trust fund program 
this program provides funding to improve the nation s roadway system 
matching funding from the various states may be required as a condition of federal funding 
the company will continue to focus on opportunities for growth both organically and through acquisitions 
the company s recent business combinations include irz consulting  llc on august   wmc technology limited on november   digitec  inc digitec on august  and watertronics  llc on january  these acquisitions reflect the execution of the company s strategy to grow its irrigation business with additional proprietary irrigation products 
in addition  on august   the company completed the acquisition of certain assets of ge transportation systems global signaling  llc 
the company sees opportunities to create shareholder value through the acquisition of product line extensions that will enhance the company s highway safety product offering  globally 
since  the company has added the operations in europe  south america  south africa  australia  new zealand and china 
the addition of those operations has allowed the company to strengthen its market position in those regions  yet they remain relatively small in scale 
as a result  none of the international operations has achieved the operating margin of the united states based irrigation operations 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations  which requires a public entity presenting comparative financial statements to disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination occurring during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period 
additionally  the standard expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the standard is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to impact the consolidated financial statements except for the requirement of additional pro forma disclosures 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  which requires the categorization by level for items that are only required to be disclosed at fair value and information about transfers between level and level in addition  the asu provides guidance on measuring the fair value of financial instruments managed within a portfolio and the application of premiums and discounts on fair value measurements 
the asu requires additional disclosure for level measurements regarding the sensitivity of fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and any interrelationships between those inputs 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to impact the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income  which amends asc  comprehensive income  by requiring all nonowner changes in shareholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the guidance is effective retrospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the guidance on its consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other 
asu no 
allows entities to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting period is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test is required 
an entity has the unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
the guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to impact the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  management must make a variety of decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  management applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant facts and circumstances 
certain of the company s accounting policies are critical  as these policies are most important to the presentation of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
they require the greatest use of judgments and estimates by management based on the company s historical experience and management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
management periodically re evaluates and adjusts the estimates that are used as circumstances change 
following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out lifo method for the company s lindsay  nebraska inventory and two warehouses in idaho and texas 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method for inventory at the company s omaha  nebraska warehouse  and at operating locations in california  wisconsin  china and australia 
cost is determined by the weighted average cost method for inventory at the company s other operating locations in washington state  france  brazil  italy and south africa 
at all locations  the company reserves for obsolete  slow moving  and excess inventory by estimating the net realizable value based on the potential future use of such inventory 
valuation of goodwill  identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets is an integral part of the company s normal ongoing review of operations 
testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management s best estimates at a particular point in time 
the dynamic economic environments in which the company s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions related to projected selling prices  market growth  inflation rates and operating expense ratios  can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests 
estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results 
changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments  as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination 
acquired intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually at august and whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company performs the impairment analysis at the reporting unit level using a two step impairment test 
fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires the company to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular assets being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows 
when determining future cash flow estimates  the company considers historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and assumptions by management in such areas as future economic conditions  industry specific conditions  product pricing  and necessary capital expenditures 
to the extent that the reporting unit is unable to achieve these assumptions  impairment losses may emerge 
the company updated its impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at august  
table of contents while the fair value of most of the company s reporting units exceeded the respective carrying values by a substantial margin  one international reporting unit  which has goodwill of million  had an estimated fair value less than in excess of carrying value 
accordingly  no impairment losses were indicated as a result of the annual impairment testing for fiscal years   and if assumptions on discount rates and future cash flows change as a result of events or circumstances  and the company believes that the long term profitability may have declined in value  then the company may record impairment charges  resulting in lower profits 
sales and profitability of each of the company s reporting units may fluctuate from year to year and within a year 
in the evaluation of the fair value of reporting units  the company looks at the long term prospects for the reporting unit and recognizes that current performance may not be the best indicator of future prospects or value  which requires management judgment 
indefinite life intangible assets primarily consist of tradenames trademarks 
the fair value of these assets are determined using a relief from royalty analysis that determines the fair value of each trademark through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate the company would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular trademark 
when determining the future cash flow estimates  the company must estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable tradename at an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows 
estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions  industry specific conditions  product pricing  and consumer trends 
revenue recognition the company s basic criteria necessary for revenue recognition are evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery of goods has occurred  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenue when these criteria have been met and when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
the company generally has no post delivery obligations to its independent dealers other than standard warranties 
revenues and gross profits on intercompany sales are eliminated in consolidation 
revenues from the sale of the company s irrigation products to its us independent dealers  international locations  and sales by its international locations are recognized based on the delivery terms in the sales contract 
if an arrangement involves multiple deliverables  the delivered items are considered separate units of accounting if the items have value on a stand alone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of their fair values 
revenues from the arrangement are allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their objectively determined fair value 
revenues for retail sales of irrigation products are recognized when the product or service is delivered to the end user customers 
a small portion of the company s revenues relate to subscription revenue of wireless management services and are recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term 
revenues from the sale of infrastructure products are usually recognized when the product is delivered to the customer  however  they are dependent on the specific delivery terms in the sales contract 
the company leases certain infrastructure property held for lease to customers such as moveable concrete barriers and qmb systems 
revenues for the lease of infrastructure property held for lease are recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term 
if an infrastructure project is completed ahead of schedule and prior to the lease term end date  the company accelerates the lease term and the timing of recognized revenue once the company is no longer required to perform under the lease contract 
the costs related to revenues are recognized in the same period in which the specific revenues are recorded 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are reported in revenue 
shipping and handling costs incurred by the company are included in cost of sales 
customer rebates  cash discounts and other sales incentives are recorded as a reduction of revenues at the time of the original sale 
estimates used in the recognition of operating revenues and cost of operating revenues include  but are not limited to  estimates for product warranties  product rebates  cash discounts and fair value of separate units of accounting on multiple deliverables

table of contents market conditions and fiscal outlook strong sales in the fourth fiscal quarter of completed a year in which the company experienced significant growth in nearly all irrigation markets and the highest revenues in company history 
agricultural commodity prices  which are subject to a variety of external factors historically driving significant fluctuation  remained relatively high at the end of fiscal  continuing to support improved irrigation equipment demand 
in august  the usda increased its projected net farm income to be the highest on record and higher than  creating positive economic conditions for us farmers 
the company believes that the positive economic conditions for farmers  the section deduction for the write off for accelerated depreciation of equipment purchases in the us  and the global drive for food security will support continued strong demand in fiscal the company believes the most significant opportunities for growth over the next several years are in international markets  where irrigation use is significantly less developed  and demand is driven by food security  water scarcity and population growth 
in the near term  the governmental debt environment will likely lead to additional examination of farm subsidies and tax credits  such as the volumetric ethanol excise tax credit for ethanol and the extension of the section deduction for accelerated depreciation on equipment purchased  which could impact demand in the us market 
in the infrastructure segment the company has recently experienced stable sales in an environment that is supported primarily by highway and railroad spending 
the company continues to experience global interest in its qmb systems as a cost effective method for managing traffic congestion by safely adding lane capacity  however  the timing of orders for these projects is uncertain and difficult to forecast in the present economic environment 
demand for the company s transportation safety products continues to be driven by population growth and the need for improved road safety 
the outlook for general government funded infrastructure spending remains challenging due to global governmental budget constraints and uncertainty on timing of a multi year us highway bill 
as of august   the company has an order backlog of million compared with million at may  and million at august  the company s backlog can fluctuate from period to period due to the seasonality  cyclicality  timing and execution of contracts 
typically  the company s backlog at any point in time represents only a portion of the revenue it expects to realize during the following three month period 
for the business overall  the global  long term drivers of water conservation  population growth  increasing importance of biofuels  and the need for safer  more efficient transportation solutions remain positive 
in addition  lindsay continues to have an on going  structured  acquisition process that will generate additional growth opportunities throughout the world in water and infrastructure 
the company s strong balance sheet has positioned the company to invest in growth initiatives both organically and through acquisitions 
lindsay is committed to achieving earnings growth through global market expansion  improvements in margins  and strategic acquisitions 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses certain financial derivatives to mitigate its exposure to volatility in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company uses these derivative instruments to hedge exposures in the ordinary course of business and does not invest in derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
the credit risk under these interest rate and foreign currency agreements is not considered to be significant 
the company has manufacturing operations in the united states  france  brazil  italy and china 
the company has sold products throughout the world and purchases certain of its components from third party international suppliers 
export sales made from the united states are principally us dollar denominated 
at times  export sales may be denominated in a currency other than the us dollar 
a majority of the company s revenue generated from operations outside the united states is denominated in local currency 
accordingly  these sales are not typically subject to significant foreign currency transaction risk 
the company s most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are the euro  the brazilian real  the south african rand and the chinese renminbi in relation to the us dollar 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies create exposures  which can adversely affect the company s results of operations 
in order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the company  at times  may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our operations 
this activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory  sales of finished goods  and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
at august   the company had outstanding forward exchange contracts with cash flow hedging relationships totaling less than million included in other current liabilities 
in order to reduce translation exposure resulting from translating the financial statements of its international subsidiaries into us dollars  the company  at times  utilizes euro foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its euro net investment exposure in its foreign operations 
at august   the company had outstanding euro foreign currency forward contracts to sell million euro at fixed prices expected to settle during the first quarter of fiscal in order to reduce interest rate risk on the million bsi term note  the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement with wells fargo bank  na that is designed to convert the variable interest rate on the entire amount of this borrowing to a fixed rate of per annum 
under the terms of the interest rate swap  the company receives variable interest rate payments and makes fixed interest rate payments on an amount equal to the outstanding balance of the bsi term note  thereby creating the equivalent of fixed rate debt
