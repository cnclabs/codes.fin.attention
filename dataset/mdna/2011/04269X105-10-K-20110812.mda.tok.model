these statements are based on current expectations  projections and assumptions made by management and are not guarantees of future performance 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements contained herein are reasonable  these expectations or any of the forward looking statements could prove to be incorrect and actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in the forward looking statements 
our future financial condition  as well as any forward looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to the factors set forth under the heading risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  all forward looking statements are made as of the date hereof and  unless required by law  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
our fiscal year ends on june when we refer to a fiscal year or quarter  we are referring to the year in which the fiscal year ends and the quarters during that fiscal year 
therefore  fiscal refers to the fiscal year ended june  overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of targeted small molecule drugs to treat patients afflicted with cancer and inflammatory diseases 
our proprietary drug development pipeline includes clinical candidates that are designed to regulate therapeutically important target pathways 
in addition  leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies partner with us to discover and develop drugs across a broad range of therapeutic areas 

table of contents the five most advanced wholly owned programs that we are developing internally are program indication clinical status arry kinesin spindle protein  or ksp  inhibitor for multiple myeloma phase arry p tie dual inhibitor for myelodysplastic syndrome  or mds phase arry her inhibitor for breast cancer phase arry p inhibitor for pain phase arry crth antagonist for allergic inflammation phase in addition to these development programs  our most advanced partnered drugs in clinical development are drug candidates indication partner clinical status selumetinib and azd mek inhibitors for cancer astrazeneca  plc phase mek and mek mek inhibitors for cancer novartis international pharmaceutical ltd

table of contents under our partnered drug discovery programs  we are generally entitled to receive payments upon achievement of clinical development and commercialization milestones and royalties based on sales of any resulting drugs 
under our existing partnered program agreements  we have the potential to earn over billion in additional milestone payments if we or our collaborators achieve the drug discovery  development and commercialization objectives detailed in those agreements 
we also have the potential to earn royalties on any resulting product sales or share in the proceeds from development or commercialization arrangements resulting from drug research and development programs 
additionally  we have a portfolio of proprietary and partnered drug discovery programs generated by our internal discovery efforts 
our internal drug discovery programs include inhibitors that target trk receptors for the treatment of pain and g protein coupled receptor  or gpr for the treatment of diabetes 
we may choose to out license select promising candidates through research partnerships 
we have built our clinical and discovery pipeline programs through spending million from our inception in through june  in fiscal  we spent million in research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery  compared to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
over the past months through the date of filing this annual report  we signed strategic collaborations with amgen  genentech and novartis 
together these collaborations entitled array to million in initial payments  over billion in potential milestone payments if all clinical and commercialization milestones under the agreements are achieved  double digit royalties and or commercial co detailing rights 
we have received a total of million in research funding and in up front and milestone payments from our collaboration partners since inception through june  our significant and or recent collaborators under our partnered programs include amgen we entered into a worldwide strategic collaboration with amgen in december to develop and commercialize our glucokinase activator  amg  and to discover potential back up compounds for amg aslan pharmaceuticals we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with aslan pharmaceuticals in july to develop array her egfr inhibitor  arry  which is currently entering phase development for solid tumors 
astrazeneca in december  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with astrazeneca under which astrazeneca received a license to three of our mek inhibitors for cancer  including selumetinib  which is currently in multiple phase clinical trials 
celgene we entered into a worldwide strategic collaboration agreement with celgene in september focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel therapeutics in cancer and inflammation 
the most advanced drug is arry  a cfms inhibitor for cancer  which is currently in a phase clinical trial

the most advanced drug is gdc  an akt inhibitor for cancer currently in a phase b trial 
the other programs under this collaboration are in preclinical development 
in august  we entered into an oncology partnership with genentech for the development of each company small molecule checkpoint kinase chk program 
the programs include genentech compound gdc rg  
table of contents currently in phase  and array compound  arry  which is being prepared for an investigational new drug application to initiate a phase trial in cancer patients 
novartis we entered into a worldwide strategic collaboration with novartis in april to develop and commercialize our mek inhibitor  mek  and other mek inhibitors identified in the agreement 
intermune program acquired by roche we entered into a collaboration with intermune in  which resulted in the joint discovery of danoprevir  a novel small molecule inhibitor of the hepatitis c virus ns a protease 
roche acquired danoprevir from intermune in danoprevir is currently in phase b clinical trials 
business development and collaborator concentrations we currently license or partner certain of our compounds and or programs and enter into collaborations directly with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies through opportunities identified by our business development group  senior management  scientists and customer referrals 
in general  our collaborators may terminate their collaboration agreements with to days prior notice 
our agreement with genentech can be terminated with days notice 
celgene may terminate its agreement with us with six months notice 
amgen may terminate its agreement with us at any time upon notice of or days depending on the development activities going on at the time of such notice 
additional information related to the concentration of revenue among our collaborators is reported in note segments  geographic information and significant collaborations to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
all of our collaboration agreements are denominated in us dollars 
critical accounting policies and estimates management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our accompanying financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
reported amounts and disclosures may have been different had management used different estimates and assumptions or if different conditions had occurred in the periods presented 
below is a discussion of the policies and estimates that we believe involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition most of our revenue is from our collaborators for research funding  up front or license fees and milestone payments derived from discovering and developing drug candidates 
our agreements with collaboration partners include fees based on annual rates for full time equivalent employees  or ftes  working on a program and may also include non refundable license and up front fees  non refundable milestone 
table of contents payments that are triggered upon achievement of specific research or development goals and future royalties on sales of products that result from the collaboration 
a small portion of our revenue comes from the sale of compounds on a per compound basis 
we report fte fees for discovery and the development of proprietary drug candidates that we out license as collaboration revenue 
license and milestone revenue is combined and consists of the portion of up front fees and ongoing milestone payments from collaborators that are recognized during the applicable period 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  which establishes four criteria  each of which must be met  in order to recognize revenue for the performance of services or the shipment of products 
revenue is recognized when a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b products are delivered or services are rendered  c the sales price is fixed or determinable and d collectability is reasonably assured 
collaboration agreements that include a combination of discovery research funding  up front or license fees  milestone payments and or royalties are evaluated to determine whether each deliverable under the agreement has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and whether reliable evidence of fair value for the deliverable exists 
deliverables in an arrangement that do not meet this separation criteria are treated as a single unit of accounting  generally applying applicable revenue recognition guidance for the final deliverable to the combined unit of accounting in accordance with sab we recognize revenue from non refundable up front payments and license fees on a straight line basis over the term of performance under the agreement  which is generally the estimated research or development term 
these advance payments are deferred and recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt  pending recognition  and are classified as a short term or long term liability in the accompanying balance sheets 
when the performance period is not specifically identifiable from the agreement  we estimate the performance period based upon provisions contained within the agreement  such as the duration of the research or development term  the existence  or likelihood of achievement of development commitments and any other significant commitments of ours 
most of our agreements provide for milestone payments 
in certain cases  a portion of each milestone payment is recognized as revenue when the specific milestone is achieved based on the applicable percentage of the estimated research or development term that has elapsed to the total estimated research and or development term 
in other cases  when the milestone payment is attributed to future development obligations of array  the revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated remaining development period 
certain milestone payments are for activities for which there are no future obligations and as a result  are recognized when earned in their entirety 
we periodically review the expected performance periods under each of our agreements that provide for non refundable up front payments and license fees and milestone payments and adjust the amortization periods when appropriate to reflect changes in assumptions relating to the duration of expected performance periods 
revenue recognition for non refundable license fees and up front payments and milestone payments could be accelerated in the event of early termination of programs or alternatively  decelerated  if programs are extended 
while changes to such estimates have no impact on our reported cash flows  our reported revenue is significantly influenced by our estimates of the period over which our obligations are expected to be performed 

table of contents cost of revenue and research and development expenses for proprietary programs we incur costs in connection with performing research and development activities which consist mainly of compensation  associated fringe benefits  share based compensation  preclinical and clinical outsourcing costs and other collaboration related costs  including supplies  small tools  facilities  depreciation  recruiting and relocation costs and other direct and indirect chemical handling and laboratory support costs 
we allocate these costs between cost of revenue and research and development expenses for proprietary programs based upon the respective time spent by our scientists on development conducted for our collaborators and for our internal proprietary programs 
cost of revenue represents the costs associated with research and development  including preclinical and clinical trials  conducted by us for our collaborators 
research and development for proprietary programs consists of direct and indirect costs for our specific proprietary programs 
we do not bear any risk of failure for performing these activities and the payments are not contingent on the success or failure of the research program 
accordingly  we expense these costs when incurred 
where our collaboration agreements provide for us to conduct research and development and for which our partner has an option to obtain the right to conduct further development and to commercialize a product  we attribute a portion of its research and development costs to cost of revenue based on the percentage of total programs under the agreement that we conclude is likely to continue to be funded by the partner 
these costs may not be incurred equally across all programs 
in addition  we continually evaluate the progress of development activities under these agreements and if events or circumstances change in future periods that we reasonably believe would make it unlikely that a collaborator would continue to fund the same percentage of programs  we will adjust the allocation accordingly 
see note deferred revenue  for further information about our collaborations 
accrued outsourcing costs substantial portions of our preclinical studies and clinical trials are performed by third party laboratories  medical centers  contract research organizations and other vendors collectively cros 
these cros generally bill monthly or quarterly for services performed or bill based upon milestone achievement 
for preclinical studies  we accrue expenses based upon estimated percentage of work completed and the contract milestones remaining 
for clinical studies  expenses are accrued based upon the number of patients enrolled and the duration of the study 
we monitor patient enrollment  the progress of clinical studies and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews of data reported to us by the cros  correspondence with the cros and clinical site visits 
our estimates depend on the timeliness and accuracy of the data provided by the cros regarding the status of each program and total program spending 
we periodically evaluate our estimates to determine if adjustments are necessary or appropriate based on information we receive 
marketable securities we have designated our marketable securities as of each balance sheet date as available for sale securities and account for them at their respective fair values as discussed further below under the heading fair value measurements 
marketable securities are classified as short term or long term based on the nature of these securities and the availability of these securities to meet current operating requirements 
marketable securities that are readily available for use in current operations are classified as short term available for sale securities and are reported as a component of current assets in the accompanying balance sheets 
marketable securities that are not considered available for use in current operations including when active markets for such securities do not exist are classified as long term available for sale securities and are reported as a component of long term assets in the accompanying balance sheets 

table of contents securities that are classified as available for sale are carried at fair value  including accrued interest  with temporary unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of stockholders deficit until their disposition 
we review all available for sale securities each period to determine if they remain available for sale based on our then current intent and ability to sell the security if we are required to do so 
the amortized cost of debt securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest income in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
realized gains and losses on auction rate securities  or ars  we held along with declines in value judged to be other than temporary are reported in realized gains on auction rate securities  net in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss when recognized 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
we sold our remaining ars during the quarter ended march  prior to their disposition  we measured the ars under the fair value hierarchy described below under the heading fair value measurements  using level iii  or unobservable inputs  as there was no active market for the securities 
the most significant unobservable inputs used in this method are estimates of the amount of time until an event resulting in the liquidity of the ars will occur and the discount rate  which incorporates estimates of credit risk and a liquidity premium discount 
due to the inherent complexity in valuing these securities  we engaged a third party valuation firm to perform an independent valuation of the ars as part of our overall fair value analysis beginning with the first quarter of fiscal and continuing through the quarter ended december  see note marketable securities in the notes to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for additional information about our investments in ars 
fair value measurements our financial instruments are recognized and measured at fair value in our financial statements and primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  long term investments  trade receivables and payables  long term debt  embedded derivatives associated with the long term debt and warrants 
we measure the fair value of assets and liabilities based on a three level hierarchy that reflects market information available and the level of judgment involved in estimating fair values for various types of assets and liabilities 
the valuation techniques we use to measure fair value are discussed in more detail in note overview and basis of presentation to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market and other data to develop estimates of fair value for assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted prices in active markets  which include our ars  warrants issued by us in connection with our long term debt and the embedded derivatives associated with the long term debt 
the use of different assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on their estimated fair value 
accordingly  the fair value estimates we disclose may not be indicative of the amount that we or holders of the instruments could realize in a current market exchange 
we periodically review the realizability of each investment when impairment indicators exist with respect to the investment 
if an other than temporary impairment of the value of an investment is deemed to exist  the cost basis of the investment is written down to its then estimated fair value 
long term debt and embedded derivatives the terms of our long term debt are discussed in detail in note long term debt to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the accounting for these 
table of contents arrangements is complex and is based upon significant estimates by management 
we review all debt agreements to determine the appropriate accounting treatment when the agreement is entered into and review all amendments to our debt agreements to determine if the changes require accounting for the amendment as a modification  or as an extinguishment and new debt 
we also review each long term debt arrangement to determine if any feature of the debt requires bifurcation and or separate valuation 
these may include hybrid instruments  which are comprised of at least two components a debt host instrument and one or more conversion features  warrants and other embedded derivatives  such as puts and other rights of the debt holder 
we currently have two embedded derivatives related to our long term debt with deerfield 
one of the embedded derivatives is a variable interest rate structure that constitutes a liquidity linked variable spread feature 
the other is a significant transaction contingent put option relating to deerfield ability to accelerate the repayment of the debt in the event of certain changes in control of our company 
such event would occur if the acquirer did not meet certain financial conditions  based on size and credit worthiness 
collectively  they are referred to as the embedded derivatives 
under the fair value hierarchy  we measure the fair value of the embedded derivatives using level iii  or unobservable inputs  as there is no active market for them  and calculate fair value using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and the black derman toy interest rate model 
the fair value of the variable interest rate structure is based on our estimate of the probable effective interest rate over the term of the deerfield credit facilities 
because the applicable interest rate is based on our cash position during the term of the loan  the determination of the probably effective interest rate requires us to estimate our cash flow forecasts  which include our expectations of future cash inflows from up front fees  milestone payments and issuances of equity 
the fair value of the put option is based on our estimate of the probability that a change in control that triggers deerfield right to accelerate the debt will occur 
with those inputs  the fair value of each embedded derivative is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the deerfield credit facilities if the embedded derivatives are included and the fair value of the deerfield credit facilities if the embedded derivatives are excluded 
due to the inherent complexity in valuing the deerfield credit facilities and the embedded derivatives  we engaged a third party valuation firm to perform the valuation as part of our overall fair value analysis 
the assumptions used in determining the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives were based on management judgment and the use of different assumptions could result in significantly different estimated fair values 
the fair value of the embedded derivatives is recorded as a component of other long term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets 
we recorded fair values for the embedded derivatives of thousand and thousand at june  and  respectively 
the initial fair value of the embedded derivatives was recorded as derivative liabilities and as debt discount in our balance sheets 
each quarter  we determine whether any adjustments to the fair value of the embedded derivatives based on management then current assumptions are necessary and record any changes in value to derivative liabilities in the balance sheets and interest expense in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
warrants that we have issued in connection with our long term debt arrangements have been classified as equity 
we value the warrants at issuance based on a black scholes option pricing model and then allocate a portion of the proceeds under the debt to the warrants based upon their relative fair values 
the warrants are recorded in stockholders equity with the offset to debt discount 
the debt discount is being amortized from the respective draw dates to the end of the term of the deerfield credit facilities using the effective interest method and recorded as interest expense in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss 

table of contents transaction fees paid in connection with our long term debt arrangements that qualify for capitalization are recorded as other long term assets in the balance sheets and amortized to interest expense in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss using the effective interest method over the term of the underlying debt agreement 
results of operations license and milestone revenue license and milestone revenue is combined and consists of up front license fees and ongoing milestone payments from collaborators

change vs 
license revenue milestone revenue total license and milestone revenue fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  license revenue increase by approximately million  or 
we recognized million and million during the current fiscal year in additional license revenue under our collaborations with amgen and novartis  respectively 
the fiscal amounts represented a full year of revenue compared to only six and three months of revenue  respectively  recognized under the these collaborations during fiscal as the collaborations were not in place for the full year 
this increased revenue was partially offset by decreased revenue of million recognized under our collaboration with celgene due to the longer period over which revenue is recognized following our conclusion that the remaining estimated performance period under the collaboration with celgene extended from september to march effective october  see note deferred revenue celgene corporation to the accompanying financial statements 
milestone revenue increased in fiscal by million  or  over the prior year 
this increase consisted of million in additional revenue from our collaboration with novartis resulting from the million milestone payment received in the fourth quarter of fiscal and from additional milestone revenue recognized under the full year of the agreement in fiscal we also recognized an additional million in revenue under our collaboration with celgene from the million milestone payment received in the second quarter of fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  we received million in upfront payments from new collaborations with amgen and novartis and million in milestone payments 
license revenue increased approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of approximately million in revenue for our new collaboration with amgen  million in revenue for our new collaboration with novartis and million in additional revenue recognized under the celgene collaboration due to our conclusion that the remaining estimated performance period decreased from five to two years effective september  see note deferred revenue celgene corporation to the accompanying financial statements 
milestone revenue increased in fiscal by million over the prior year 
the increase includes million in milestones recognized for the advancement of certain research programs under our collaboration with genentech  compared with thousand of milestone revenue under our genentech 
table of contents collaboration recognized in fiscal additionally  we recognized million in milestone revenue from intermune during fiscal and similarly  recognized million in milestone revenue from ventirx during fiscal collaboration revenue collaboration revenue consists of revenue for our performance of drug discovery and development activities in collaboration with partners  which include co development of proprietary drug candidates we out license as well as screening  lead generation and lead optimization research  custom synthesis and process research and to a small degree the development and sale of chemical compounds 
below is a summary of our collaboration revenue dollars in thousands years ended june  change vs 
change vs 
collaboration revenue fiscal compared to fiscal collaboration revenue decreased by million  or  in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to fewer scientists engaged on our collaboration with genentech during the second half of fiscal  which resulted in million less revenue compared to fiscal this decrease was partially offset by increased revenue of million and thousand from funded research under our collaborations with amgen and novartis  respectively 
fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in collaboration revenue of million  or  for the year ended june  was from million of revenue from our new collaboration with amgen and thousand of additional revenue under our collaboration with genentech  of which million that was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal was for the finalization of contract rates for services rendered in the prior fiscal year 
this increase was offset by fewer scientists engaged on the genentech program beginning in the third quarter of fiscal and thousand less revenue due to the expiration of our research term with ventirx 
cost of revenue cost of revenue represents costs attributable to discovery and development including preclinical and clinical trials we may conduct for our collaborators and the cost of chemical compounds sold from our inventory 
these costs consist mainly of compensation  associated fringe benefits  share based compensation  preclinical and clinical outsourcing costs and other collaboration related costs  including supplies  small tools  travel and meals  facilities  depreciation  recruiting and relocation costs and other direct and indirect chemical handling and laboratory support costs 
below is a summary of our cost of revenue dollars in thousands years ended june  change vs 
change vs 
cost of revenue cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  cost of revenue increased thousand  or  but decreased as a percentage of total revenue 
the increase in absolute dollars was related to the 
table of contents restructuring charges incurred during the fourth quarter as discussed under note restructuring charges fiscal restructuring to the financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
we recorded million to cost of revenue from the reduction in force 
in addition  related to the restructuring  we vacated a portion of one of our significant laboratory facilities at our longmont facility and recorded thousand to cost of revenue in accelerated depreciation on leasehold improvements 
this increase was partially offset by reduced outsourcing costs to advance our partnered programs with amgen and novartis through clinical trials  as our partners now bear all or an increased share of the development costs compared to the prior year 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue is the result of increased license and milestone revenue recognized during the year which did not have a direct impact on our expenses 
fiscal compared to fiscal cost of revenue increased in absolute dollars and decreased as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal compared to the prior year 
the increase in absolute dollars was for discovery  preclinical and clinical costs for the advancement of certain collaboration programs  including celgene and our new programs with amgen and novartis 
these increases were offset by the change in the estimate for the celgene cost allocation from to cost of revenue and to research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery to and  respectively  as discussed further in note deferred revenue celgene corporation to the accompanying financial statements 
in addition  there were fewer scientists engaged on our collaboration with genentech and our research term with ventirx  which expired in september the decrease as a percentage of total revenue was because of greater license and milestone revenue recognized during the year 
research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery our research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery include costs associated with our proprietary drug programs for scientific and clinical personnel  supplies  inventory  equipment  small tools  travel and meals  depreciation  consultants  sponsored research  allocated facility costs  costs related to preclinical and clinical trials and share based compensation 
we manage our proprietary programs based on scientific data and achievement of research plan goals 
our scientists record their time to specific projects when possible  however  many activities simultaneously benefit multiple projects and cannot be readily attributed to a specific project 
accordingly  the accurate assignment of time and costs to a specific project is difficult and may not give a true indication of the actual costs of a particular project 
as a result  we do not report costs on a program basis

salaries  benefits and share based compensation outsourced services and consulting laboratory supplies facilities and depreciation other total research and development for proprietary drug discovery fiscal compared to fiscal research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery for fiscal decreased by million because our development costs for amg and mek both shifted out of research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery to cost 
table of contents of revenue as a result of partnering those programs with amgen and novartis during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
those decreases were partially offset by the increased development costs from continuing to progress our most advanced wholly owned drug programs through the clinic 
also included in fiscal research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery were restructuring charges incurred during the fourth quarter as discussed in note restructuring charges fiscal restructuring within the notes to the financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
we recorded million and million to research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery from the reduction in force and accelerated depreciation on leasehold improvements  respectively 
fiscal compared to fiscal research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery for fiscal decreased from the prior year because our development costs for amg and mek shifted out of research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery to cost of revenue as a result of partnering these programs under our collaboration agreements with amgen and novartis 
additionally  we reduced overall spending as we focused on the development efforts for our most advanced programs and reduced resources devoted to early discovery research  which occurred after the second quarter of fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation and associated fringe benefits not included in cost of revenue or research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery and include other management  business development  accounting  information technology and administration costs  including patent filing and prosecution  recruiting and relocation  consulting and professional services  travel and meals  sales commissions  facilities  depreciation and other office expenses

income tax benefit during fiscal  we recorded an income tax receivable and benefit related to a research and experimentation federal income tax credit 
the thousand credit relates to research expenditures we made in years prior to liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses and an accumulated deficit as a result of ongoing research and development spending since inception 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we had net losses of million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
we have historically funded our operations from up front fees and license and milestone payments received under our collaboration and out licensing transactions  from the issuance and sale of equity securities and through debt provided by our credit facilities 
for example  the company has received million in the last nineteen months  including the following payments under its collaborations in december  we received a million up front payment from amgen inc under a collaboration and license agreement 
in april  we received million in up front and milestone payments under a license agreement with novartis pharmaceutical international ltd 

table of contents in december  we received a million milestone payment under a license agreement with celgene corporation 
in may  we received a million milestone payment under a license agreement with novartis pharmaceutical international ltd 
however  until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from our operations  which we do not expect to achieve in the foreseeable future  we will continue to utilize our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and will continue to be dependent upon funds provided from the sources mentioned above  which may not be available or forthcoming 
prior to the reduction in force in june  we were using approximately million per quarter to fund our operations 
our estimates indicate we will save approximately million per quarter from this reduction 
these savings may be partially offset by increased development costs with third parties as our wholly owned development programs progress into phase and phase such increased spending for development costs could be reduced or eliminated if sufficient funds are not available when needed 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities we hold as of june   as well as the million upfront payment from genentech related to the license agreement that we entered into on august   discussed in note subsequent event to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  will enable us to continue to fund our operations for at least the next months 
our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our operations beyond that period is dependent upon factors which may be outside our control 
we believe we will continue to obtain funding through milestone payments from existing collaborations and plan to continue to satisfy most or all of our interest payment obligations under the credit facilities with deerfield with the proceeds from sales of our common stock pursuant to the equity distribution agreement with piper jaffray co 
discussed in note equity distribution agreement  or through the issuance of shares of common stock to deerfield in accordance with our facility agreements with deerfield 
we may also fund operations through the sale of our debt or equity securities 
although we are currently in active licensing discussions with a number of potential partners on select programs  there can be no assurance  that we will successfully close new collaborations that provide for additional up front fees 
furthermore  sufficient funds may not be available to us when needed from existing or future collaborations or from the proceeds of debt or equity financings 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding from these or other sources when needed or to the extent needed  it may be necessary to significantly reduce our current rate of spending through additional reductions in staff and delaying  scaling back  or stopping certain research and development programs 
insufficient funds may also require us to relinquish greater rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms to us or our stockholders than we would otherwise choose in order to obtain up front license fees needed to fund our operations 
these events could prevent us from successfully executing our operating plan and could raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern in future periods
