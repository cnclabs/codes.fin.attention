item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of our strategy regency centers corporation the parent company began its operations as a real estate investment trust reit in and is the managing general partner in regency centers  lp the operating partnership 
the term the company or regency means the parent company and the operating partnership  collectively 
our key strategic goals are focused on producing superior results to our shareholders by achieving total shareholder returns in excess of reit shopping center averages  and sustaining growth in our net asset value and our earnings over an extended period of time 
we will achieve these goals through owning  operating  and investing in a high quality portfolio of primarily grocery anchored shopping centers that are tenanted by market dominant grocers  category leading anchors  specialty retailers  and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities 
all of our operating  investing  and financing activities are performed through the operating partnership  its wholly owned subsidiaries  and through its investments in real estate partnerships with third parties also referred to as co investment partnerships or joint ventures 
the parent company currently owns approximately of the outstanding common partnership units of the operating partnership 
because of our structure and certain public debt financing  the operating partnership is also a registrant 
at december   we directly owned shopping centers the consolidated properties located in states representing million square feet of gross leasable area gla 
our cost of these shopping centers and those under development is billion before depreciation 
through co investment partnerships  we own partial ownership interests in shopping centers the unconsolidated properties located in states and the district of columbia representing million square feet of gla 
our investment in the partnerships that own the unconsolidated properties is million 
certain portfolio information described below is presented on a combined basis  which is a total of the consolidated properties and the unconsolidated properties  for our consolidated properties only and for the unconsolidated properties that we own through co investment partnerships 
we believe that presenting the information under these methods provides a more complete understanding of the properties that we wholly own versus those that we indirectly own through entities we do not control  but for which we provide asset management  property management  leasing  investing  and financing services 
the shopping center portfolio that we manage  on a combined basis  represents shopping centers located in states and the district of columbia and contains million square feet of gla 
we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores  major retail anchors  side shop retailers  and restaurants  including ground leasing or selling building pads out parcels to these same types of tenants 
historically  we have experienced growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers 
our shopping centers generate substantial daily traffic by conveniently offering necessities and services 
this high traffic should generate increased sales to our tenants  and attract new tenants to our shopping centers  thereby driving higher occupancy levels and rental rate growth  which we expect will provide sustained growth in earnings per share and unit  and net asset value over the long term 
increasing occupancy in our shopping centers to historical levels and achieving positive rental rate growth are key objectives of our strategic plan 
we seek a range of strong national  regional  and local specialty retailers  for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading grocers and major retailers who provide a mix of goods and services that meet consumer needs 
we have created a formal partnering process  the premier customer initiative pci  to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our side shop retailers 
the objective of pci is for us to build a base of non anchor tenants who represent the best in class operators in their respective merchandising categories 
such retailers reinforce the consumer appeal and other strengths of a center s anchor  help grow and stabilize a center s occupancy  reduce re leasing downtime  reduce tenant turnover  and yield higher sustainable rents 
at december   the operating shopping centers on a combined basis were leased and unchanged from december  during the recession of  we did experience occupancy declines in our 
table of contents 
index to financial statements shopping centers  however  occupancy levels appear to have stabilized as the economy continues its recovery 
we continue to produce higher levels of new leasing activity and fewer tenant defaults as compared to  and move outs of weaker tenants hurt by the recession appear to be on the decline 
we did however continue to experience a decline in our rental rates 
during and  rental rates in the combined portfolio declined and  respectively 
we currently expect rental rates to decline moderately in isolated markets as we release vacant space  or renew expiring leases  where the previous tenant s rental rates were above market 
we continue to closely monitor the operating performance and rent collections of all tenants in our shopping centers  especially those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition  business practice  and store closings in other locations 
we expect these weaker tenants to continue moving out of our shopping centers during  which will provide us the opportunity to release these vacancies to financially stronger vibrant tenants that will contribute to the overall success of our shopping centers 
we also continue to monitor tenants who have co tenancy clauses in their lease agreements 
these tenants are typically located in larger format community shopping centers that contain multiple anchor tenants whose leases contain these types of clauses 
co tenancy clauses have several variants they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their store  they may allow a tenant the opportunity to close their store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes their store prior to lease expiration  or more commonly  they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center 
if economic weakness persists in geographic areas where we have centers that contain leases with these types of clauses  we could experience reductions in rent and occupancy related to tenants exercising their co tenancy clauses 
we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development 
we will continue to use our unique combination of development capabilities  market presence  and anchor relationships to invest in value added opportunities sourced from land owners and joint venture partners  the redevelopment of existing centers  and the development of land 
development is customer driven  meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction 
developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and specialty retailers  resulting in modern shopping centers with long term anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital 
this development process typically requires three to five years from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction  lease up  and stabilization of rental income  but can take longer depending upon tenant demand for new stores and the size of the project 
in the near term  fewer new store openings by retailers are resulting in reduced demand for new retail space 
as a result  we scaled back our development program by decreasing the number of new projects started  phasing existing developments that lack retail demand  and decreasing overhead costs 
although our development program will continue to play an important part in our long term business strategy  new development projects will be rigorously evaluated in regard to the cost and availability of capital  visibility of tenant demand to achieve a stabilized occupancy  and sufficient investment returns 
we strive to cost effectively and opportunistically strengthen our balance sheet  which should allow us to access various sources of capital to fund our future commitments 
we endeavor to continue improving our key financial ratios and to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets of our consolidated real estate assets at december  are unencumbered 
such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain significant availability on our million unsecured line of credit the line and revolving credit facility which had an outstanding balance of million on the line at december  our debt to asset ratio before the effect of accumulated depreciation  including our pro rata share of the debt and assets of joint ventures is at december   and is higher than our ratio at december  of  however  our ratio could decline in if we settle the million forward equity offering during  discussed further below 
our coverage ratio including our pro rata share of our partnerships was times at december  and we define our coverage ratio as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our 
table of contents 
index to financial statements lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders 
we plan to grow ebitda through growth in net operating income by returning the occupancy percentages in our shopping centers back to historic levels and by acquiring or developing high quality shopping centers  which in combination with a conservative capital structure should favorably impact our coverage ratio on a long term basis 
capital recycling involves identifying non strategic assets from our real estate portfolio and selling those in the open market  and reinvesting the sale proceeds into new higher quality developments and acquisitions that will generate sustainable revenue growth and attractive returns 
to the extent that we are unable to generate capital in excess of our current commitments  we intend to reduce our new investment activity accordingly 
co investment partnerships provide us with a reliable capital source for shopping center acquisitions  as well as  the opportunity to earn fees for asset management  property management  and other investing and financing services 
as asset manager  we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating  investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the co investment partnerships as those applied to the portfolio that we wholly own 
co investment partnerships grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from us 
although selling properties to co investment partnerships reduces our direct ownership interest  it provides a source of capital that further strengthens our balance sheet while we continue to share  to the extent of our ownership interest  in the risks and rewards of shopping centers that meet our high quality standards and long term investment strategy 
our co investment partnerships have significant levels of debt that mature through and are subject to significant borrowing risks if the capital markets again become unavailable as they were during the recession 
while we have to date successfully refinanced our maturing loans  the us economy although recovering  remains weak  and could hinder our ability to access capital  including access by our joint venture partners  or to obtain future financing to fund maturing debt 
currently  we believe that our joint venture partners have sufficient capital or access thereto for these future capital requirements 
the impact to the company or a co investment partner defaulting on its share of a capital call is discussed below under liquidity and capital resources

although base rent is supported by long term lease contracts  tenants who file bankruptcy are given the right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores 
in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases  we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues and tenant receivables 
we are closely monitoring industry trends and sales data to help us identify declines in retail categories or tenants who might be experiencing financial difficulties as a result of slowing sales  lack of credit  changes in retail formats or increased competition 
as a result of our findings  we may reduce new leasing  suspend leasing  or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer

blockbuster has also provided formal notice that five additional stores will close in early and those respective leases will be rejected upon closing 
we expect additional store closures and lease rejections as their bankruptcy continues

the combined annual base rent on a pro rata basis associated with these leases is insignificant to our annual base rent on a pro rata basis 
we continuously monitor the financial condition of our tenants 
we communicate often with those tenants who have announced store closings or filed bankruptcy 
we are not currently aware of the pending bankruptcy or announced store closings of any tenants in our shopping centers beyond those described above that would individually cause a material reduction in our revenues  and no tenant represents more than of our annual base rent on a pro rata basis 
liquidity and capital resources our parent company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our operating partnership 
the parent company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the operating partnership in exchange for additional partnership units 
any new debt is issued by our operating partnership or by our co investment partnerships 
accordingly  the discussion below regarding liquidity and capital resources is presented on a consolidated basis for the company

table of contents 
index to financial statements on december  our cash balance was million 
we operate our business such that we expect net cash provided by operating activities  before settlements of derivative instruments  in combination with proceeds generated from sales of development properties and land will provide the necessary funds to pay our scheduled mortgage loan principal payments  capital expenditures necessary to maintain our shopping centers  and distributions to our share and unit holders 
the following table summarizes these amounts for the years ended december    and in thousands cash flow from operations settlements of derivative instruments gains on sales of developments and land total scheduled principal payments capital expenditures to maintain shopping centers distributions to share and unit holders total our dividend distribution policy is set by our board of directors and they continuously review our financial results 
our board of directors recently declared our quarterly dividend of per share  payable march  to stock and unit holders of record as of february  our dividend has remained unchanged since may we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that at a minimum meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
at december  commitments available to us under our operating partnership s unsecured line of credit the line and revolving credit facility totaled million and our outstanding balance on the line was million 
in february  the million revolving credit facility expired with no balance outstanding 
the maturity date of the million line was extended one year to february we initiated discussions with our lenders to evaluate our line requirements and we expect to complete and close on a new credit facility prior to the maturity date of the line 
we currently estimate that we will require million through primarily to repay million of maturing debt excluding scheduled principal payments  complete in process developments  and to fund our pro rata share of estimated capital contributions to our co investment partnerships for repayment of debt 
included in these capital requirements are million of unsecured public debt  as further described below under notes payable  which we intend to repay at maturity from the proceeds of new unsecured issues of debt or equity 
to the extent that issuing unsecured debt is cost prohibitive or unavailable  we believe that we have sufficient unsecured assets available for secured mortgage financing whose proceeds could be used to repay the unsecured debt at maturity 
when necessary  the line is available to fund our capital needs 
we will also receive estimated net proceeds of million once we settle the million common share forward equity offering forward equity offering  as further discussed below under equity and capital 
as part of our strategy  we will sell shopping centers that no longer meet our long term investment criteria and invest those proceeds into higher quality shopping centers 
during  we sold three shopping centers for million and reinvested the majority of the proceeds into two shopping centers with a combined purchase price of million including the assumption of existing mortgage debt of million 
on september   we acquired a shopping center for a purchase price of million which included the assumption of million in debt 
acquired lease intangible assets and acquired lease intangible liabilities of million and approximately  respectively were recorded for this acquisition 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination and the results are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition

acquired lease intangible assets and acquired lease intangible liabilities of million and million  respectively were recorded for this acquisition 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination and the results are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
at december  we had development properties on a combined basis that were either under construction or in lease up  which when completed  will represent a net investment of million after projected sales of adjacent land and out parcels 
this compares to development properties at december  representing an investment of million upon completion 
we estimate that we will earn an average return on investment from our current development projects of when completed and fully leased 
costs necessary to complete in process development projects  net of reimbursements and projected land sales  are estimated to be million 
at december   our joint ventures had million of scheduled secured mortgage loans and credit lines maturing through on april  our joint venture with global retail investors gri prepaid  without penalty  million of mortgage loans that would have matured in june and july regency and gri each contributed capital to the joint venture for their respective pro rata share of the repayment 
on june  our joint venture with gri closed on million of new ten year secured mortgage loans and distributed the proceeds to regency and gri in proportion to their ownership interests 
a more detailed loan maturity schedule and further discussion about the repayment of maturing debt is included below under notes payable 
we believe that our joint venture partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or access thereto to fund future capital requirements 
we communicate with our co investment partners regularly regarding the operating and capital budgets of our co investment partnerships  and believe that we will successfully complete the refinancing of our joint venture debt as it matures in the future 
in the event that a co investment partner was unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the co investment partnership  we would have the right  but not the obligation  to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call at an interest rate at the lesser of prime plus a pre defined spread or the maximum rate allowed by law 
a decision to loan to a defaulting joint venture partner  which would be secured by the defaulting partner s partnership interest  would be based on the fair value of the co investment partnership assets  our joint venture partner s financial health  and would be subject to an evaluation of our own capital commitments and sources to fund those commitments 
alternatively  should we determine that our joint venture partners will not have sufficient capital to meet future capital needs  we could trigger liquidation of the partnership 
for the co investment partnerships that have distribution in kind dik provisions  and own multiple properties  a liquidation of the co investment partnership could be completed by either a dik of the properties to each joint venture partner in proportion to its partnership interest  open market sale  or a combination of both methods 
our co investment partnership properties have been financed with non recourse loans that represent of the total debt of the co investment partnerships including lines of credit as of december  we and our partners have no guarantees related to these loans 
in those co investment partnerships which have dik provisions  if we trigger liquidation by distribution in kind  each partner would receive title to properties selected in a rotation process for distribution and would assume any related loans secured by the properties distributed 
the loan agreements generally provide for assumption by either joint venture partner after obtaining any required lender consent 
we would only be responsible for those loans we assume through the dik and only to the extent of the value of the property we receive  since after assumption through the dik the loans would remain non recourse 
we also have a investment interest in a single asset joint venture with an million loan which contains guarantees from each partner limited to their respective interest 
on june  we issued million of ten year senior unsecured notes  and the net proceeds were used to repay the balance of the line at that point in time 
on october  we issued million of ten year senior unsecured notes  and used million to repay the balance of the line 
on october  we completed a tender offer for outstanding debt by purchasing million of unsecured notes maturing in january  and million of unsecured notes maturing in january the proceeds

our preferred stock and preferred units  though callable by us  are not redeemable in cash at the option of the holders 
although common or preferred equity raised in the public markets by the parent company is an option to fund future capital needs  access to these markets could be limited at times 
when conditions for the issuance of securities are acceptable  we will evaluate issuing debt or equity to fund new acquisition opportunities  fund new developments  or repay maturing debt 
at december   the parent company and the operating partnership each had existing shelf registration statements available for the issuance of new equity or debt securities 
investments in real estate partnerships we account for certain investments in real estate partnerships using the equity method 
we have determined that these investments are not variable interest entities and do not require consolidation under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  and therefore are subject to the voting interest model in determining our basis of accounting 
major decisions  including leasing  property acquisitions not meeting pre established investment criteria  dispositions  financings  annual budgets  and dissolution of the joint ventures are subject to the approval of all partners 
recognition of gains from sales to co investment partnerships is recorded on only that portion of the sales not attributable to our ownership interest unless there are certain provisions in the partnership agreement which allow the company a unilateral right to initiate a dik upon liquidation  as described further below under our critical accounting policies and note b summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements each included herein 
the presence of such dik provisions requires that we apply a more restrictive method of gain recognition restricted gain method on sales of properties to these co investment partnerships 
this method considers our potential ability to receive property through a dik on which partial gain has been recognized  and ensures maximum gain deferral upon sale to a co investment partnership containing these unilateral dik rights dik jv

the operations and gains related to properties sold to our investments in real estate partnerships are not classified as discontinued operations because we continue to provide property management services to these shopping centers under market rate agreements with our co investment partnerships

critical accounting policies and estimates knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period 
these accounting estimates are based upon  but not limited to  our judgments about historical results  current economic activity  and industry accounting standards 
they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments  or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates 
we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness  however  the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable accounts receivable represent revenues recognized in our financial statements  and include base rent  percentage rent  and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs  insurance and real estate taxes 
we analyze tenant receivables  historical bad debt levels  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our reported net income loss is directly affected by our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable 
recognition of gains from the sales of real estate profits from sales of real estate are recognized under the full accrual method by us when a sale is consummated  the buyer s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property  a receivable  if applicable  is not subject to future subordination  we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership  and we do not have substantial continuing involvement with the property 
we sell shopping center properties to joint ventures in exchange for cash equal to the fair value of the percentage interest acquired by our partners 
we have accounted for those sales as partial sales and recognized gains on those partial sales in the period the properties were sold to the extent of the percentage interest sold  and in the case of certain joint venture partnerships  we apply a more restrictive method of recognizing gains as discussed below 
the gains and operations associated with properties sold to these joint venture partnerships are not classified as discontinued operations because we continue to partially own and manage these shopping centers 
certain dik jvs give either partner the unilateral right to elect to dissolve the joint venture partnership and  upon such an election  receive a distribution in kind of the assets of the joint venture partnership equal to its respective ownership interests 
we have concluded that these dik dissolution provisions constitute in substance call put options  and represent a form of continuing involvement with respect to property that we sold to these joint venture partnerships  limiting our recognition of gain related to the partial sale 
this more restrictive method of gain recognition  the restricted gain method  considers our potential ability to receive property through a dik on which partial gain has been recognized  and ensures  maximum gain deferral upon sale to a dik jv 
we have applied the restricted gain method to partial sales of property to joint venture partnerships that contain such unilateral dik provisions 
capitalization of costs we capitalize the acquisition of land  the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them into properties in development in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in summary  a project changes from non operating to operating when it is substantially completed and held available for occupancy 
at that time  costs are no longer capitalized 
other development costs include pre development costs essential to the development of the property  as well as  interest  real estate taxes  and direct employee costs incurred during the development period 
pre development 
table of contents 
index to financial statements costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits  legal  engineering  and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center 
at december  and  we had capitalized pre development costs of approximately  and  respectively  of which approximately  and  respectively  were refundable contract deposits 
if we determine that the development of a specific project undergoing due diligence is no longer probable  we immediately expense all related capitalized pre development costs not considered recoverable 
during the years ended december    and  we expensed pre development costs of approximately  million  and million  respectively  recorded in other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
interest costs are capitalized into each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended 
we cease interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements  but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond months after substantial completion of the building shell 
during the years ended december    and  we capitalized interest of million  million  and million  respectively  on our development projects 
we have a staff of employees who directly support our development program 
all direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project 
during the years ended december    and  we capitalized million  million  and million  respectively  of direct costs incurred to support our development program 
the capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring 
if accounting standards issued in the future were to limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized we could incur additional increases in general and administrative expenses which would further reduce net income 
real estate acquisitions upon acquisition of operating real estate properties  we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land  building and improvements  and identify intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and below market leases  in place leases and tenant relationships and assumed debt 
based on these estimates  we assign the purchase price to the applicable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
we evaluate the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets each reporting period and account for any changes in estimated useful lives over the revised remaining useful life 
we expense transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred 
valuation of real estate investments our long lived assets  primarily real estate held for investment  are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted 
in addition  we perform an annual review to re evaluate market based capitalization rates  estimated holding periods  expected future operating income  trends and prospects  the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
if we determine that the carrying amount of a property is not recoverable  we write down the asset to fair value 
for properties to be held and used for long term investment  to determine recoverability  we estimate undiscounted future cash flows over the expected investment term including the estimated future value of the asset upon sale at the end of the investment period 
future value is generally determined by applying a market based capitalization rate to the estimated future net operating income in the final year of the expected investment term 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the long lived asset s carrying amount  management then determines the fair value of the long lived asset and if the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value 
fair value is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available  or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the traditional discounted cash flow approach 
for properties held for sale  we estimate current market resale values through appraisal less expected costs to sell 
a loss in value of an investment under the equity method of accounting  which is other than a temporary decline  must be recognized in the period in which the loss occurs 
in the case of our investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships  we calculate the present value of our investment by discounting estimated future cash flows over the expected term of the investment 
fair value can 
table of contents 
index to financial statements fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including changes in the general economy of those markets in which we operate  our estimated holding period of the property  tenant credit quality  and demand for new retail stores 
if as a result of a change in our strategy for a specific property which we own directly or through our co investment partnerships  a property previously classified as held and used is changed to held for sale  or if its estimated holding period changes  such change could cause us to determine that the property is impaired and a provision for impairment in relation to that property would be recorded by us either directly or through a reduction of our equity in income of real estate partnerships 
discontinued operations the application of current accounting principles that govern the classification of any of our properties as held for sale on the balance sheet  or the presentation of results of operations and gains on the sale of these properties as discontinued  requires management to make certain significant judgments 
we classify an operating property or a property in development as held for sale when we determine that the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition  the property is being actively marketed for sale  and management believes it is probable that a sale will be consummated within one year 
given the nature of real estate sales contracts  it is not unusual for such contracts to allow a contractual buyer a due diligence period to evaluate the property with the right to cancel the contract without any financial loss 
in addition  certain other matters critical to the final sale  such as financing arrangements often remain pending even upon contract acceptance 
as a result  properties under contract may not close within the expected time period  or may not close at all 
therefore  any properties categorized as held for sale represent only those properties that management has determined are likely to close within the requirements set forth above 
in order to determine if the results of operations and gain on sale should be reflected as discontinued operations  prior to the sale  we evaluate the extent of our involvement and significance of cash flows the sale will have on a property after the sale 
any property sold in which we have significant continuing involvement or cash flows most often sales to co investment partnerships in which we continue to manage the property is not considered to be discontinued 
in addition  any property which we sell to an unrelated third party  but which we retain a property management function  is not considered discontinued 
therefore  only properties sold  or to be sold  to unrelated third parties  where we will have no significant continuing involvement or significant cash flows are classified as discontinued and their operations  including any mortgage interest and gain on sale  are reported in discontinued operations so that the operations are clearly distinguished 
prior periods are also reclassified to reflect the operations of these properties as discontinued operations 
when we sell operating properties to our joint ventures or to third parties  and will have continuing involvement  the operations and gains on sales are included in income from continuing operations 
if circumstances arise that previously were considered unlikely and  as a result  we decide not to sell a property previously classified as held for sale  the property is reclassified as held and used and is measured individually at the lower of its i carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale  adjusted for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used or ii the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell 
any required adjustment to the carrying amount of the property reclassified as held and used is included in income from continuing operations in the period of the subsequent decision not to sell 
if a property is reclassified as held and used  the results of operations of the property previously reported in discontinued operations are reclassified and included in income from continuing operations for all periods presented 
investments in real estate partnerships in addition to owning real estate directly  we invest in real estate through our co investment partnerships 
as asset and property manager  we conduct the business of the unconsolidated properties held in the co investment partnerships in the same way that we conduct the business of the consolidated properties that are wholly owned  therefore  the critical accounting policies as described are also applicable to our investments in the real estate partnerships 
we account for all investments in which we do not have a controlling financial ownership interest using the equity method 
we have determined that these investments are not variable interest entities and do not require consolidation  and therefore  are subject to the voting interest model in determining our basis of accounting 
decisions  including property acquisitions and dispositions  financings  certain leasing arrangements  annual budgets and dissolution of the joint ventures are subject to the approval of all partners  or in the case of the fund  its advisory committee

index to financial statements our revenues decreased by million or to million in  as summarized in the following table in thousands change minimum rent percentage rent recoveries from tenants and other income management  transaction  and other fees total revenues generally  leased percentages were unchanged between and  however  the percent leased of a development property may not reflect rent paying occupancy if a tenant s space is under construction for a portion of the year and not yet rent paying 
therefore  increase in minimum rent was related primarily to tenants opening new stores in our development properties during  or operating for a full months during  as compared to declines in percentage rent were a result of the change in percentage rent lease terms due to the increase in minimum rent for certain leases  upon their renewal 
the increase in recoveries from tenants and other income resulted from a significant increase in termination fees received during related to weak tenant operators negotiating an early end to their lease agreements  as well as  higher operating and real estate tax expenses 
the decrease in management  transaction  and other fees relates primarily to a million disposition fee we received from chrr in equal to of the gross sales price paid by gri described below

property management fees are based on net operating income and increased as a result of the increase in base rent 
transaction fees decreased primarily as a result of the million disposition fee we received from chrr in leasing commissions decreased as a result of our increased ownership in the grir joint venture  which resulted in a reduction of fee recognized

table of contents 
index to financial statements increases in operating  maintenance  and real estate taxes along with depreciation and amortization expense are primarily related to the recently completed developments commencing operations in the current year and general increases in expenses incurred by the operating properties 
the majority of these cost increases are recoverable from our tenants and included in our revenues 
general and administrative expense increased million as a result of higher levels of compensation earned in for higher levels of performance as compared to the provision for doubtful accounts decreased million in as compared to directly related to significantly improved tenant collection rates and fewer tenant defaults  continued evidence of the recovering us economy 
the decrease in other expenses is due to a million tax benefit incurred in  as compared to tax expense of million incurred in  as well as a reduction in pre development costs written off as a result of pursuing less new development activity during the following table presents the change in interest expense in thousands change interest on unsecured credit facilities interest on notes payable capitalized interest hedge interest interest income interest on unsecured credit facilities decreased by million as a result of lower outstanding balances during as compared to capitalized interest decreased as a result of a reduced development activity as compared to  and a higher level of shopping center completions during during  we sold eleven out parcels for net proceeds of million and recognized a gain of approximately  as compared to where we sold out parcels for net proceeds of million and recognized a gain of approximately  during  we recognized approximately  in contingent gains related to three properties sold to the usaa partnership during during  we sold eight operating properties to the usaa partnership for net proceeds of million and recognized gains of million recorded under the restricted gain method 
in  we recorded a provision for impairment of million  which was a decrease of million from the impairment provision recorded in the impairment provision recorded in was a result of identifying properties that had been previously considered held for long term investment and determining that they no longer met our long term investment strategy 
as a result of this re evaluation  we changed our expected investment holding period and reduced our carrying value to estimated fair value 
during  we recorded a provision for impairment of million  of which million related to land held for future development or sale 
during  a prospective anchor tenant for several development sites expressed considerable uncertainty about the timing and location of future stores given the recession occurring during that period 
as a result  we reevaluated and reduced the probability of future development at these sites and accordingly reduced our carrying value in the land parcels to estimated fair value of the land 
included in the impairment provision recorded during were operating properties that were subjected to the same investment criteria evaluation that we applied during  and we accordingly reduced our carrying value on those properties to estimated fair value based upon a change in expected holding periods 
if we sell a property or classify a property as held for sale  we are required to reclassify its operations into discontinued operations for all prior periods which results in a reclassification of amounts previously reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations

general and administrative expense was higher in primarily related to million in severance and benefit payments associated with two reductions in force completed during  offset by reduction in incentive compensation for not achieving targeted performance levels 
during  we increased the provision for doubtful accounts to reserve for past due amounts reflecting a significantly higher tenant default rate on rental payments as tenants struggled during the recession of the decrease in other expenses was due to a reduction in pre development costs written off as a result of pursuing less new development activity 
the following table presents the change in interest expense in thousands change interest on unsecured credit facilities interest on notes payable capitalized interest hedge interest interest income interest on unsecured credit facilities decreased by million as a result of lower average outstanding balances on our credit facilities in as compared to at december   the balance of our line was zero  we had repaid the term loan portion of our unsecured term facility  and we completed a partial tender offer of outstanding unsecured debt 
interest on notes payable increased as a result of issuing million secured mortgage loans in addition to four mortgage loans assumed as part of the mcwr i dik liquidation

the decrease in our equity in income loss of investments in real estate partnerships is primarily related to a provision for impairment of million recognized by grir associated with multiple shopping centers that became targeted for sale in the near future 
our pro rata share of this provision for impairment was million 
excluding the impairment  the declines in revenues or losses incurred by our co investment partnerships were directly related to reductions in operating revenues as occupancy levels declined in and to increased allowances for doubtful accounts as they also experienced a significantly higher tenant default rate during a difficult economic environment

our diluted net loss per unit was in as compared to net income per unit of in environmental matters we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry  the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers  and underground petroleum storage tanks 
we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations 
generally  we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to non chlorinated solvent systems 
where available  we have applied and been accepted into state sponsored environmental programs 
we have a blanket environmental insurance policy that covers us against third party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination 
we have also placed environmental insurance  where possible  on specific properties with known contamination  in order to mitigate our environmental risk 
we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites 
we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so 
we estimate the cost associated with these legal obligations to be million and million  all of which has been accrued as of december  and  respectively 
we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position  liquidity  or results of operations  however  we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities  that any previous owner  occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us  that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants  by the condition of nearby properties  or by unrelated third parties  or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 
inflation deflation inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers  however  more recent data suggests inflation will eventually become a greater concern as the economy continues to recover from the recent recession 
substantially all of our long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of our leases are

index to financial statements for terms of less than ten years  which permits us to seek increased rents upon re rental at market rates 
most of our leases require tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
however  during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness  minimum rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines 
occupancy declines resulting from a weak economic period will also likely result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk 
our line commitment has a variable interest rate that is based upon libor plus a spread of basis points and our revolving credit facility has a variable interest rate based upon libor plus a spread of basis points 
libor rates charged on our unsecured credit facilities change monthly 
the spread on the unsecured credit facilities is dependent upon maintaining specific credit ratings 
if our credit ratings are downgraded  the spread on the unsecured credit facilities would increase  resulting in higher interest costs 
we are also exposed to higher interest rates when we refinance our existing long term fixed rate debt 
the objective of our interest rate risk management is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps  or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
during  we entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps the swaps totaling million with fixed rates of    and 
at inception  we designated these swaps as cash flow hedges to lock in the underlying treasury rates on million of fixed rate financing that was expected to occur in and during  we paid million to partially settle million of the swaps in place to hedge the million mortgage loan issued on july  on june   we paid million to partially settle million of the remaining million swaps in place to hedge the million ten year senior unsecured notes issued on june  on september   we paid million to settle the remaining million of swaps to hedge the million ten year senior unsecured notes issued on october  for the year ended december   we recognized income of million for changes in hedge ineffectiveness attributable to revised inputs used in valuation models to estimate effectiveness 
we have million of fixed rate debt maturing in and that has a weighted average fixed interest rate of  which includes million of unsecured long term debt 
we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments 
based upon the current capital markets  our current credit ratings  and the number of high quality  unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings  we expect that we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund these debt obligations 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal cash flows in thousands  weighted average interest rates of remaining debt  and the fair value of total debt in thousands as of december   by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table  those rates represent rates that existed at december  and are subject to change on a monthly basis 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december  and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
since firm commitments are not presented  the table has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at that time  and actual interest rates 
thereafter total value fixed rate debt average interest rate for all fixed rate debt variable rate libor debt average interest rate for all variable rate debt average interest rates at the end of each year presented 
the fair value of total debt in the table above is billion versus the face value of billion  which suggests that as new debt is issued in the future to repay maturing debt  the cost of new debt issuances will be higher than the current cost of existing debt
