non cash deductions for depreciation and amortization contributed  and a reduction of deferred income tax assets favorably impacted operating cash flow by  the partial settlement of the post retirement benefits liability used cash of approximately  changes in working capital reduced cash provided by operating activities by  due to increases in accounts receivable and inventory  which were partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
cash used for investing activities was  for the year ended december   which primarily represents additional investment made in the company s new manufacturing facility in mexico as well as the acquisition of machinery and equipment at all of the company s production facilities 
commitments for capital expenditures were  at december  planned capital expenditures for are approximately  as previously discussed the company expects to add additional capacity to its matamoros facility to meet demand in and beyond 
given these capacity needs management is evaluating the specific production capacity requirements and is likely to commit additional capital spending of million to million in cash used in financing activities was  in the primary financing activities were principal payments on the capex loan  term loan and industrial revenue bond 
at december   the company had cash on hand of  and an available line of credit of  line of credit  which is scheduled to mature on april  at december  and  core molding technologies had no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit 
management expects the current cash balance along with this line of credit to be adequate to meet core molding technologies planned liquidity needs 
however  the company may seek additional bank funding as deemed necessary to support the additional capital needs as mentioned above 
the company is required to meet certain financial covenants included in its debt agreements with respect to leverage ratios  fixed charge ratios  capital expenditures as well as other customary affirmative and negative covenants 
as of december   the company was in compliance with its financial debt covenants 
based on the company s forecasts which are primarily based on industry analysts estimates of heavy and medium duty truck production volumes as well as other assumptions management believes to be reasonable  management believes that the company will be able to maintain compliance with the covenants to the credit agreement  as amended  for the next months 
management believes that cash flow from operating activities together with available borrowings under the credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity needs 
however  if a material adverse change in the financial position of the company should occur  or if actual sales or expenses are substantially different than what has been forecasted  the company s liquidity and ability to obtain further financing to fund future operating and capital requirements could be negatively impacted 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet transactions the company has the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations  including purchase obligations  as defined by the united states securities and exchange commission sec 
a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
other long term liabilities are defined as long term liabilities that are reflected on the company s balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
based on this definition  
table of contents the table below includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations 
it does not include normal purchases  which are made in the ordinary course of business 
the following table provides aggregated information about the maturities of contractual obligations and other long term liabilities as of december  and after total debt line of credit interest operating lease obligations contractual commitments for capital expenditures post retirement benefits total interest is calculated based the effective interest rates on the company s borrowing arrangements reflective of the interest rate swap agreements in place for the long term borrowings 
as of december   the company had no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  post retirement benefits  and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable allowances management maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of  at december  and  at december  management also records estimates for chargebacks such as customer returns  customer rework chargebacks  discounts offered to customers  and price adjustments 
should these customer returns  chargebacks  discounts  and price adjustments fluctuate from the estimated amounts  additional allowances may be required 
the company recorded allowances for chargebacks of  at december  and  at december  inventories inventories  which include material  labor  and manufacturing overhead  are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the inventories are accounted for using the first in  first out fifo method of determining inventory costs 
inventory quantities on hand are regularly reviewed  and where necessary  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based on historical and anticipated usage 
the company had an allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory of  at december  and  at december  
table of contents goodwill and long lived assets management evaluates whether impairment exists for goodwill and long lived assets annually on december or at interim periods if an indicator of impairment exists 
should actual results differ from the assumptions used to determine impairment  additional provisions may be required 
in particular  decreases in future cash flows from operating activities that are below our assumptions could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to recover its long lived assets 
the company has not recorded any impairment to goodwill for long lived assets for the years ended december  and a decrease in future cash flows would not adversely impact the net book value of goodwill and a increase in the rate used to discount future cash flows would not adversely impact the net book value of goodwill 
self insurance the company is self insured with respect to most of its columbus and batavia  ohio and gaffney  south carolina medical and dental claims and columbus and batavia  ohio workers compensation claims 
the company has recorded an estimated liability for self insured medical and dental claims incurred but not reported and worker s compensation claims incurred but not reported at december  and of  and  respectively 
post retirement benefits management records an accrual for post retirement costs associated with the health and life insurance plan sponsored by core molding technologies 
should actual results differ from the assumptions used to determine the reserves  additional provisions may be required 
in particular  increases in future healthcare costs above the assumptions could have an adverse effect on core molding technologies operations 
the effect of a change in healthcare costs is described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
as described in note  in august  the company eliminated its health and life insurance post retirement benefits for all current and future represented employees who had not retired as of august  the elimination of benefits resulted in a reduction of the company s post retirement health and life insurance benefits liability of  core molding technologies had a liability for post retirement health and life insurance benefits based on actuarially computed estimates of  at december   and  at december  revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized at the time products are shipped and title transfers 
allowances for returned products  chargebacks and other credits are estimated and recorded as revenue is recognized 
tooling revenue is recognized when the customer approves the tool and accepts ownership 
progress billings and expenses are shown net as an asset or liability on the company s balance sheet 
tooling in progress can fluctuate significantly from period to period and is dependent upon the stage of tooling projects and the related billing and expense payment timetable for individual projects and therefore does not necessarily reflect projected income or loss from tooling projects 
at december  the company recorded a net liability related to tooling in progress of  which represents approximately  of progress tooling billings and  of progress tooling expenses 
at december  the company recorded a net liability related to tooling in progress of  which represents approximately  of progress tooling billings and  of progress tooling expenses 
income taxes management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance and has not recorded a valuation allowance due to anticipating it being more likely than not that the company will realize these benefits 
an analysis is performed to determine the amount of the deferred tax asset that will be realized 
such analysis is based upon the premise that the company is and will continue as a going concern and that it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
management reviews all available evidence  both positive and negative  to assess the long term earnings potential of the company using a number of alternatives to evaluate financial results in economic cycles at various industry volume conditions 
other factors considered are the company s relationships with its two largest customers navistar and paccar  and any recent customer diversification efforts 
the projected availability of taxable income to realize the tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal of temporary differences before expiration of these benefits are also considered 
management believes that  with the 
table of contents combination of available tax planning strategies and the maintenance of its relationships with its key customers  earnings are achievable in order to realize the net deferred tax asset of  management recognizes the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination 
management has recognized all tax positions as of december  the net deferred tax asset of  at december  consists primarily of temporary differences relating to post retirement health and life insurance benefits of  as well as temporary differences between the book and tax value for accrued liabilities  inventory reserves  and accounts receivable of approximately  these are partially offset by a deferred tax liability related to property  plant and equipment of  inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities vie  which was effective for our first fiscal quarter of the new guidance requires a qualitative approach to identify a controlling financial interest in a vie  and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a vie and whether an interest in a vie makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the vie 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk core molding technologies primary market risk results from changes in the price of commodities used in its manufacturing operations 
core molding technologies is also exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations associated with the mexican peso 
core molding technologies does not hold any material market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
core molding technologies has the following six items that are sensitive to market risks industrial revenue bond irb with a variable interest rate although the company has an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate at  revolving line of credit and mexican loan payable under the credit agreement  each of which bears a variable interest rate  capex loan payable with a variable interest rate although the company has an interest rate swap to fix the variable portion of the applicable interest rate at  bank term loan under the credit agreement  with a variable interest rate although the company has an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate at  foreign currency purchases in which the company purchases mexican pesos with united states dollars to meet certain obligations that arise due to operations at the facility located in mexico  and raw material purchases in which core molding technologies purchases various resins and fiberglass for use in production 
the prices and availability of these materials are affected by the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as processing capacity versus demand 
assuming a hypothetical increase in commodity prices  core molding technologies would be impacted by an increase in raw material costs  which would have an adverse effect on operating margins 
assuming a hypothetical change in short term interest rates  interest paid on the company s line of credit and the mexican loan would have been impacted in and the interest rate on these loans is based upon libor 
although a change in short term interest rates would impact the interest paid by the company  it would not have a material effect on earnings before tax 
a change in future interest rate curves would significantly impact the fair value of the company s interest rate swaps
