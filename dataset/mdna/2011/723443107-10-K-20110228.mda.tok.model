item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook results our consolidated operating income decreased by million in as compared to pinnacle experienced a decline in operating income of million  primarily attributable to a one time charge of million related to a signing bonus contained in an agreement with alpa  as more fully discussed below 
colgan s operating income decreased by million 
the large decline was primarily related to substantially higher maintenance costs on our saab and q fleets  higher pilot and flight attendant wages due to an increase in employees prior to the launch of new q service in late  and higher fuel costs in our pro rate operations 
these significant cost increases were partially offset by a increase in revenue per available seat mile within our pro rate operations 
mesaba earned million in operating income during the six months ended december  mesaba acquisition on july   we purchased mesaba from delta for total consideration of million 
mesaba operates a fleet of crj aircraft  crj aircraft  and saab b aircraft as a delta connection carrier  with hubs in atlanta  detroit  memphis  minneapolis st 
paul  and salt lake city 
all of mesaba s aircraft are leased from delta under contracts conterminous with their respective operating agreements with delta 
in connection with our acquisition of mesaba  we entered into a new capacity purchase agreement with delta providing for the operation of mesaba s crj fleet for a period of years the mesaba crj dca  and we modified our existing crj airline services agreement the crj asa with delta to include mesaba s fleet of crj aircraft 
we also entered into a two year capacity purchase agreement covering mesaba s fleet of saab b aircraft the saab dca 
under these agreements  delta will pay us rates and reimburse us certain direct expenses  similar to our existing capacity purchase agreements with delta 
these agreements provide for targeted cash income cash payments received from delta less all expenses other than depreciation and amortization and interest expense  and less forecasted capital expenditures of million per year through july because these agreements contain rates that increase annually with inflation  we can earn more or less than million of cash contract income in any given year depending on how our expenses fluctuate 
in addition  primarily because depreciation and amortization are generally excluded from reimbursement under these agreements  our reported operating income under generally accepted accounting principles related to mesaba s operations will differ from the million target cash contract income 
these agreements also provide for certain rate resets 
under these rate resets  we will negotiate and agree with delta on new rates based on a forecast of our projected cash expenditures under the agreements for the subsequent five year period  inclusive of our targeted cash contract income of million per year 
finally  these agreements contain targets related to our operating performance  and we can earn additional incentives or incur performance penalties depending on our actual operating performance 
because we will incur some integration costs during and  we do not expect to realize the full million targeted cash contract income during these years 
prior to selling mesaba to us  delta announced plans to retire mesaba s fleet of saab b aircraft during accordingly  the saab dca provides for the wind down of mesaba s saab b operations over a period not to extend beyond june under the saab dca  we do not expect to earn a material amount of income or incur a material loss while we operate the saab b aircraft 
as each aircraft exits service  we will return the aircraft to delta on an as is  where is basis 
simultaneously with our acquisition of mesaba  we resolved certain contractual disputes relating to our existing capacity purchase agreements with delta resulting in no gains or losses recognized and greater stability in our future cash flows under these contracts 
for additional information about these disputes  refer to note  code share agreements with partners  and note  acquisition of mesaba  to our consolidated financial statements  which are included in item of this form k 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook continued alpa collective bargaining agreement we had been in negotiations with alpa to amend the collective bargaining agreement covering pinnacle s pilots since april  and we had been negotiating with alpa to establish an initial collective bargaining agreement applicable to colgan s pilots since late upon the acquisition of mesaba  we agreed with alpa to negotiate for a new combined collective bargaining agreement covering the pilots at all three of our subsidiaries  and in december we reached a tentative agreement 
the tentative agreement contains substantial salary and benefits increases for our pilots  bringing their total compensation in line with the average for airlines with similarly sized aircraft 
the tentative agreement also contains a one time million signing bonus that will be paid to pilots at pinnacle airlines 
we accrued this one time bonus in the fourth quarter of pilots at all three airlines ratified the contract in february  and the provisions will go into effect immediately 
exclusive of the one time signing bonus  we expect our total pilot costs to increase by approximately million during as a result of the new agreement 
in connection with our acquisition of mesaba  we modified our existing capacity purchase agreements with delta to provide for a rate adjustment that will be effective upon the earlier of the date that we implement a combined collective bargaining agreement covering both pinnacle s and mesaba s pilots  or the date that the jet operations of pinnacle and mesaba are combined under a single operating certificate the adjustment trigger date 
this rate adjustment is designed to increase pinnacle s rates commensurate with the increase in pilot labor costs related to pinnacle s delta operations 
the rate adjustment will be calculated and agreed to by us and delta months after the adjustment trigger date 
at that time  we will receive a one time retroactive adjustment related to the prior months for the increase in our pilot costs  inclusive of training and displacement related to the merging of pinnacle s and mesaba s pilot groups 
in addition  we will receive a prospective adjustment payable for future periods such that our rates pertaining to pilot costs will be approximately equivalent to our actual pilot costs at the time of the rate adjustment 
we believe that the adjustment trigger date will occur upon the implementation of our new agreement with alpa in march while we will not receive any cash payments related to these adjustments from delta until  we currently estimate that the one time retroactive adjustment related to the months ended march could be as much as million  and the prospective rate increase that would begin in march could be as much as million annually 
these rate adjustments will be based on assumptions about cost allocations between the pilot groups of our operating subsidiaries  and will be subject to negotiation with delta 
no assurances can be made that the amount of the rate adjustments ultimately agreed to with delta will equal our current estimates 
while we are still evaluating the timing of revenue recognition associated with these adjustments  we currently believe that we will not recognize this revenue until upon the final determination of the amount 
in addition  with the exception of annual increases indexed to the producer price index  the rates associated with our pilot labor costs under all of our cpas with delta will not be adjusted again until operational integration plan upon acquiring mesaba  we announced that our long term plan for our operating structure is to transition all jet flying to pinnacle  and to merge colgan and mesaba s turboprop operations with mesaba remaining the surviving carrier 
we aspire for our regional airline subsidiaries to lead the industry with regard to safety programs and a strong safety culture  and our realignment of operations will be implemented with this goal as our highest priority 
we believe that realigning the common fleet types of pinnacle  mesaba and colgan into two strong regional airlines also will provide for the most efficient and reliable regional operations for our partners 
since the acquisition  we have completed the plan to integrate the jet operations of pinnacle and mesaba  and to merge colgan s and mesaba s turboprop operations 
implementation of our integration plan is subject to faa approval  which we expect to obtain during the first half of we currently anticipate that completion of our integration will take to months after approval by the faa 
our implementation plan will include significant one time costs associated with training  relocation and displacement for our pilots  flight attendants and mechanics  information technology costs related to the integration of systems and operating processes  and relocation  retention and severance packages for management employees as we combine administrative functions 
we currently estimate that these one time integration costs will be approximately to million  the majority of which we expect to incur during an insignificant amount of integration costs were incurred in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook continued other items we generated million in cash from operations during  and we ended the year with million in cash and cash equivalents 
our operating cash flow included an influx of approximately million related to our federal income tax refund that we received in we did not make any federal income tax payments in and do not anticipate making federal income tax payments in due to the accelerated depreciation recognized for tax purposes related to our newly acquired crj and q aircraft 
operating cash flow was also improved in due to the acquisition of mesaba  which contributed approximately million in operating cash flow 
mesaba s operating cash flow included a one time benefit of approximately million related to the establishment of our new cpas with delta 
our operating cash flow in will decline for several reasons  including the fact that we will not receive an income tax refund and because mesaba s operating cash flow will exclude the one time benefit described above 
we accepted delivery of eight q aircraft in late and we will take delivery of an additional eight aircraft through august that will be operated under our capacity purchase agreement with united 
we have a commitment from export development canada edc to finance of the purchase price of each aircraft  and we expect to use our internally generated funds to pay for the remaining amount 
we believe our current liquidity position and expected operating cash flow is sufficient to meet our remaining debt service requirements and the unfinanced portion of our q purchase commitments 
under our capacity purchase agreement with united  payments associated with our capital investment in these aircraft are fixed over the ten year term of the contract 
we expect that our q growth will have a positive impact on operating income in in march  we will begin operating seven leased saab b aircraft within our pro rate operations with scheduled service at new york s laguardia airport as a us airways express carrier 
this increase in service was driven by the delay in the transfer of the bulk of us airways regional takeoff and landing slots at laguardia to delta the laguardia slot swap 
while we expect these operations to continue to at least the end of  our agreement with us airways is designed to be temporary and we will end service at laguardia upon any resolution of the laguardia slot swap between us airways  delta and the department of transportation 
we continue to position ourselves to capitalize on long term profitable opportunities to increase the number of regional aircraft that our subsidiaries operate 
our competitors capacity purchase agreements for over seat regional jet aircraft are set to expire between now and while many of these regional jets will likely no longer operate within the networks of the major us airlines  we believe some of these contracts will be renewed or offered to other regional airlines and some will be replaced with larger regional jets 
we intend to actively compete to obtain profitable regional jet and q flying during this period of transition within the industry  and we believe our history of strong operating performance with a competitive cost structure will position us to succeed

pinnacle operating revenues compared to regional airline services crj for the year ended december   revenue earned under our crj asa of million increased by million  or 
for the year ended december   the rates that delta pays us under our crj asa increased by 
changes in our rates are tied to changes in the producer price index  which increased by from december to december this increase in rates caused an increase in our revenue of approximately million 
additionally  a change in reimbursable expenses caused revenue to increase by million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   revenue from reimbursable expenses increased by million related to heavy maintenance checks  million for increased property taxes  million related to increased insurance expenses  and million in other reimbursable expenses 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million primarily related to reduced deicing expense  which is discussed further below 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations continued as a result of our amended crj asa  effective july   certain expenses changed classification to become pass through expenses  while certain rates in the crj asa were reduced 
these changes  along with a change in methodology related to departure based revenue  caused revenue for to decrease by approximately million  as compared to pinnacle crj for the year ended december   revenue earned under the pinnacle crj dca of million increased by million  or  as compared to this increase is primarily related to an increase in the rates that delta pays us under our pinnacle crj dca  which resulted in an increase of revenue of approximately million 
in addition  revenue increased due to an increase in aircraft utilization  which caused block hours to increase by and revenue to increase by approximately million 
the remaining increase is attributable to an increase in reimbursable expenses  which increased revenue by approximately million 
offsetting this increase is a million decrease in incentive revenue earned during the year ended december   primarily as a result of changes in our pinnacle crj dca that became effective july  other revenue other revenue increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to this increase is related to an increase in third party ground handling revenue  as we are providing these services to other airlines in an increased number of cities 
compared to regional airline services for the year ended december   revenue earned under our crj asa of million decreased by million  or  compared to revenue earned under our crj asa was reduced by the return of crj aircraft throughout pursuant to the terms of our crj asa 
during the year ended december   we operated fewer average crj aircraft than compounding the reduction in our operating fleet size  we experienced declines in aircraft utilization 
as a result of both the reduction in our crj fleet size and the decline in aircraft utilization  volume based revenue decreased by million  or  during  as compared to we recorded million less in departure based revenue during  as compared to  as a result of a dispute with delta over the amount that we earn for each departure under the crj asa 
delta asserted that it had the right under the crj asa to reduce both the revenue we receive and the cost we pay for ground handling services in certain cities where delta or its designee provides ground handling services to us 
during  delta began to compensate us according to its interpretation of the crj asa 
as a result  the revenue we received for the year ended december   related to certain ground handling services was reduced by approximately million  and our related ground handling costs were reduced by million  with the resulting net effect of a reduction of operating income of approximately million 
lastly  a change in other reimbursable expenses caused revenue to increase by million  for the year ended december   as compared to pursuant to the terms of our crj asa with delta  we are reimbursed with margin for certain operational costs 
these costs include certain maintenance costs  aircraft rentals  passenger liability and hull insurance  property taxes  fuel  ground handling at crj asa service cities  and landing fees at detroit metropolitan wayne county airport dtw 
to the extent that these reimbursable costs increase or decline  we experience a corresponding increase or decline in revenue 
revenue from reimbursable expenses increased by million related to heavy maintenance checks  million related to increased deicing expense  million related to increased insurance expenses  and million related to other maintenance expense 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million related to reduced property taxes  million related to reduced engine maintenance expense  and million related to reduced aircraft rental expense 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations continued revenue earned under the pinnacle crj dca was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  as compared to during the year ended december   on average we operated more crj aircraft than in other revenue other revenue decreased million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to this decrease was primarily related to a decline in revenue earned from providing baggage handling services to delta at its memphis hub  offset by an increase in third party ground handling revenue related to new third party ground handling contracts that we entered into during pinnacle operating expenses compared to salaries  wages and benefits increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the increase year over year is primarily attributable to the million charge in the fourth quarter of for pilot bonuses agreed to under the tentative agreement  which was ratified in february see note  commitments and contingencies  in item of this form k for additional details 
the remaining increase is related to increases in wage rate and benefit costs for existing employees  along with a increase in headcount 
wage rate and benefit increases were inclusive of a million increase year over year for increases in our matching contribution to pinnacle s non pilot k plan 
during  the matching contribution was temporarily suspended 
ground handling services increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to there were large changes in the mix of cities served resulting in a net increase in ground handling costs and a related net increase in revenue 
ground handling expense in cities where delta or its designee provided ground handling decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to this decrease is a result of the previously discussed change in methodology regarding ground handling amounts under the crj asa 
ground handling expense in cities where we previously provided our own services increased million for the year ended december  as compared to in addition  our reimbursable deicing expense decreased  resulting in a corresponding decrease in revenue 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the increase is primarily related to increased reimbursable costs for heavy airframe maintenance on our fleet of crj aircraft 
for the year ended december   heavy check expense increased million as compared to other rentals and landing fees decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to these changes are primarily due to the transition of certain airport stations from pinnacle to delta throughout  which resulted in a reduction in facility and equipment rental expense of million for the year ended december  as compared to this decrease is offset by an increase of million in airport landing fees for the year ended december  as compared to  primarily due to an increase in landing fee rates 
other expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to property tax expenses increased million primarily due to a one time reduction of property tax expense in from a settlement with the state of tennessee related to prior period taxes assessed 
in addition  insurance expense increased by million for the year ended december  effective july  the company exited a joint airline insurance program covering delta and six other airlines 
the rates for pinnacle s new coverage are significantly higher than those of our previous coverage obtained through the joint program 
pinnacle also experienced a million increase in costs related to flight crew training and other crew related expenses 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations continued compared to salaries  wages and benefits increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to this increase is largely attributable to rising health care and insurance costs  which increased approximately million in  as compared to wages increased slightly  as wage rates increased for existing employees  while headcount decreased  primarily related to reductions in ground handling personnel in stations where we performed our own ground handling functions under the crj asa 
the reduction in ground handling personnel occurred as a result of delta reassigning ground handling functions to itself or its designees 
wage rate increases were also offset by a million reduction in the matching contribution of pinnacle s non pilot k plan 
during  the matching contribution was temporarily suspended 
aircraft rental expense decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to this decrease relates to a decrease of in the average number of crj aircraft  which are leased from delta  operated during as compared to as previously discussed  aircraft rentals are reimbursable expenses under our crj asa  and as a result of the fewer average number of crj aircraft in our fleet  revenue under our crj asa decreased by million for the year ended december  ground handling services decreased by million  or  during the year ended december   as compared to although this change is nominal  there were large changes in the mix of reimbursed and unreimbursed ground handling expense 
these changes caused significant decreases in regional airlines services revenue 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to this increase is attributable to additional maintenance related to the aging of our crj fleet as the majority of our crj aircraft are no longer covered under warranty 
we are also incurring additional maintenance expense on our crj fleet for specific maintenance programs and upgrades recommended by the manufacturer associated with engine fan blade replacement and adjustments to the motor controlling deployment of the wing flaps 
commissions and passenger related expense decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to this is primarily related to the decrease in the number of airport locations we staff under our crj asa 
as a result  we do not incur the same level of passenger related expenses  as these costs are included in the ground handling rates that we pay delta or its designated ground handler 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in this is primarily related to depreciation on our fleet of crj aircraft  the majority of which were added to our fleet throughout other expense decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to effective july   we are no longer participating in delta s insurance program 
the rates for our new coverage are significantly higher than those of our previous coverage  which caused an increase in insurance expense of million 
these insurance costs are reimbursed with margin by delta 
offsetting this increase is a decrease in other expenses primarily related to decreases in costs related to crew training and other crew related expenses 
we were experiencing low levels of attrition within our flight crews and were not hiring or training new crew members and as a result  flight crew related costs and training decreased by million for the year ended december  in addition  property tax expenses increased million primarily due to a one time reduction of property tax expense in from a settlement with the state of tennessee related to prior period taxes assessed 
property tax is also reimbursed with margin by delta 
the remainder of the decrease is attributable to the fleet expansion expenses we incurred in as we were bringing the crj operations online  a decrease in professional services costs related to our new systems implementation project in  and a decrease in station related costs as several stations formerly operated by pinnacle are now operated by delta or its designees

the average price paid per gallon increased during the year ended december  as compared to partially offsetting this increase in price was a decrease in the total number of gallons consumed during the year ended december   which was related to the decrease in our pro rate operations 
aircraft fuel associated with our q operations is provided at no cost under the united q cpa 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations continued depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   as compared to this is primarily due to an increase in aircraft depreciation expense related to the delivery of eight q aircraft during the second half of this is partially offset by a decrease in amortization related to certain airport landing slots that were sold in early other expenses increased by million  or  during the year ended december   as compared to the increase is primarily attributable to flight crew training and other crew related expenses due to the planned deliveries of additional q aircraft during and early in addition  colgan experienced an increase in recruiting and training expenses related to the additional lines of flying operated under our cpa during insurance coverage obtained in july with significantly higher rates resulted in increases in aircraft and passenger liability related insurance year over year 
impairment and aircraft retirement charges of million for the year ended december  related to certain maintenance costs necessary to restore certain saab and beech aircraft to a condition suitable for return to the lessor or for sale 
compared to salaries  wages and benefits increased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to this increase is largely attributable to increased health care and insurance costs  which increased by approximately million in  as compared to additionally  a number of relocated colgan employees received additional compensation as part of the colgan headquarters relocation from manassas  virginia to memphis 
the remaining increase relates to an increase in wage rates for existing employees 
aircraft rentals decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to the return of eight leased saab and beech aircraft throughout and early ground handling services decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to this was primarily attributable to the decrease in departures in our pro rate operations 
the increase in our q operations had no effect on ground handling services expense  as ground handling services associated with our q operations are provided by united at no cost under the united q cpa 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expenses decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to this decrease is related to the removal of eight saab and beech aircraft from our pro rate fleet 
these aircraft were out of warranty and required more maintenance expense than our new fleet of q aircraft  which are currently covered under warranty 
other rentals and landing fees increased by million  or  as compared to landing fees associated with our pro rate operations decreased by million related to the overall decrease in our pro rate operations 
landing fees associated with the united q cpa increased by million as a result of changes in q fleet size  along with the fact that we are now serving markets with significantly higher landing fee rates  such as newark liberty international airport 
landing fees associated with our united q cpa are fully reimbursed by united 
most airports in our network have also increased their rates as a result of an overall reduction in industry wide capacity 
aircraft fuel expense decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to this decline is primarily related to the decrease in the average price of fuel 
colgan s average price paid per gallon decreased during the year ended december   as compared to in addition  gallons consumed decreased by for the year ended december   due to the retirement of several of our saab and beech aircraft in conjunction with the elimination of certain markets operated under pro rate agreements 
aircraft fuel associated with our q operations is provided at no cost under the united q cpa 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations continued commissions and passenger related expenses decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to this is primarily attributable to the decrease in passengers carried by our pro rate operations 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to this is primarily related to changes in the q aircraft fleet size 
the q aircraft were added to our fleet throughout however  during the year ended december   we operated one fewer aircraft than the same period in the previous year 
other expenses decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to this decrease is primarily related to decreases in costs related to crew training and other crew related expenses 
this was related to low levels of flight crew attrition  which reduced levels of training as experienced flight crews are retained 
in contrast  we incurred significant training costs during the first half of as we were introducing the q fleet 
as a result  flight crew related costs decreased by million for the year ended december  the remaining decrease is attributable to the fleet expansion expenses we incurred in as we were bringing the q operations online 
offsetting these decreases is an increase in insurance expense of million 
as previously discussed  effective july   we obtained new insurance coverage with significantly higher rates 
impairment and aircraft retirement charges of million for the year ended december  related to certain maintenance costs necessary to restore certain saab and beech aircraft to a condition suitable for return to the lessor or for sale 
in the year ended december   impairment and aircraft retirement charges of million primarily related to the impairment of colgan s goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources we generate cash primarily by providing regional airline and related services to our code share partners and passengers 
we generated million in cash from operations during  and we ended the year with million in cash and cash equivalents 
our operating cash flow included an influx of approximately million related to our federal income tax refund that we received in we did not make any federal income tax payments in and do not anticipate making federal income tax payments in due to the accelerated depreciation recognized for tax purposes related to our newly acquired crj and q aircraft 
operating cash flow was also improved in due to the acquisition of mesaba  which contributed approximately million in operating cash flow 
mesaba s operating cash flow included a one time benefit of approximately million related to the establishment of our new cpas with delta 
our operating cash flow in will decline because we will not receive an income tax refund and because mesaba s operating cash flow will exclude the one time benefit described above 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources continued contractual obligations 
the following chart details our debt and lease obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period thereafter total debt interest payments on debt purchase obligations operating leases other leasing arrangements total contractual cash obligations the amounts noted above for operating leases include  of obligations for crj aircraft leased from delta 
we are reimbursed by delta in full for crj aircraft rental expense under the crj asa 
for a more detailed discussion of operating leases  refer to note  operating leases  in item of this form k 
the table above excludes an approximate  accident liability related to flight  recorded in other liabilities  as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  in item of this form k 
this liability is offset in its entirety by a receivable  recorded in other assets  which we expect to receive from insurance carriers as claims are resolved 
in connection with the acquisition of mesaba  we entered into a promissory note with delta for million 
the promissory note is secured by certain equipment of  and all of the capital stock in  mesaba  and has an interest rate of 
the principal is payable in equal quarterly installments of million  that began on october  and end on july  payments under the promissory note may be made by deductions from amounts due and payable under all of our operating agreements with delta 
the promissory note contains customary covenants and representations  including a covenant to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents at the end of each month  and restrictions related to the payment of dividends and repurchase of stock 
the promissory note is also cross defaulted to all of our operating agreements with delta 
we believe we will have sufficient operating cash flow to comply with the minimum liquidity covenant 
during  we completed a three year term loan financing for million the spare parts loan 
the spare parts loan is secured by a pool of pinnacle s and colgan s spare repairable  rotable and expendable parts and certain aircraft engines 
the interest rate for the spare parts loan is a variable rate  which is indexed to libor subject to a floor and was initially 
in january  we amended the spare parts loan to reduce the required minimum liquidity level on four specific dates during the first quarter of during august  we again amended the spare parts loan to reduce the interest rate floor to  to extend the maturity date until june   to provide for additional borrowings of up to million  and to provide for a pre payment penalty under certain circumstances 
as of december   the interest rate on the spare parts loan was 
the spare parts loan requires that we maintain a minimum liquidity level at the end of every month and at specified times preceding the maturity date or call date of certain other indebtedness 
the spare parts loan also has standard provisions relating to our obligation to timely repay the indebtedness and maintenance of the collateral base relative to the outstanding principal amount of the borrowing 
amounts outstanding under the spare parts loan were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter  we drew an additional million  increasing total borrowings under the spare parts loan 
the proceeds are being used to finance the initial provisioning of rotable aircraft parts to support our q aircraft purchases and general working capital purposes 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources continued in february  we issued million principal amount of our senior convertible notes due the notes 
the notes bore interest at the rate of per year  payable in cash semiannually in arrears on february and august of each year 
during  we purchased and retired million principal amount of the notes 
on february   the holders of the remaining outstanding million principal amount of the notes exercised their option to require us to purchase the notes for cash at a purchase price equal to of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
on january   we entered into a short term loan agreement with a bank for million the bridge loan 
the bridge loan was secured by our anticipated federal income tax refund and had an effective interest rate of 
the bridge loan was designed to temporarily provide us with additional working capital until we received its federal income tax refund 
we repaid the bridge loan in full upon receipt of the federal income tax refund of approximately million in late february in february  we entered into a purchase agreement for up to firm and option q aircraft with bombardier  inc under the agreement  we were obligated to purchase a minimum of q regional aircraft  which we satisfied during in january  we modified the purchase agreement to exercise our right to purchase the remaining ten firm q aircraft and five of the option q aircraft  which began delivering in the third quarter  and will continue through april in december  we exercised one additional option for delivery of a q aircraft in the third quarter of during the second half of  we acquired eight of the q aircraft and completed the related financings with edc at an average rate of 
we anticipate taking delivery of seven q aircraft in the first half of and one aircraft in the third quarter of we also secured additional options to acquire q aircraft that would be delivered in upon completion of this amendment  we now have optional rights to acquire a total of q aircraft  of which would deliver late in and early  and of which would deliver in we are required to make pre delivery payments to bombardier for the eight firm and one exercised option for the q aircraft that we have on order 
these payments began in january and will continue through february during  we made pre delivery payments totaling million  million of which was financed under a pre delivery payment financing facility provided by edc 
the interest rate associated with this pre delivery payment facility is indexed to libor  and was as of december  the outstanding balance of these borrowings as of december  was million 
as each aircraft is delivered to us  we repay the associated borrowings 
we anticipate repaying the pre delivery payment facility in the first and second quarters of we have also obtained a commitment from edc to finance of the purchase price of the remaining eight q aircraft on order upon the delivery of each aircraft 
although we believe that our liquidity resources are adequate  we anticipate our balance of cash and cash equivalents to decrease considerably through as we take delivery of the remaining eight q aircraft on order and concurrently repay the related pre delivery payment financing facility 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december  this is primarily attributable to tax refunds of approximately million received in  and due to million in cash generated from our operations 
as mentioned previously  mesaba generated approximately million in operating cash flow for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december  this is primarily attributable to the approximately million tax refund we received in april  and due to approximately million in cash generated from our operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december  this was due primarily to the million in hedge related payments made during  offset by cash primarily generated from regional airline service operations of million 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources continued investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
this is primarily attributable to million in purchases of property and equipment  million paid in pre delivery payments for q aircraft deliveries  and million for the acquisition of mesaba  partially offset by million of cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and investments 
we expect non aircraft cash capital expenditures for to be approximately to million  including cash purchases of aircraft parts 
we expect to fund the non aircraft capital expenditures with existing cash resources  debt financings related to spare parts purchases  and cash flows generated from our operations 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
this was primarily attributable to proceeds received from certain ars redemptions at par by the issuers  proceeds from sale of our ars portfolio  and net proceeds from exercises of a portion of the ars call options  totaling million 
in addition  we received net insurance proceeds of million 
these amounts were offset by million in cash purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
this was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the sale of ars of million  offset by million in net cash purchases of property and equipment  primarily consisting of flight equipment 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
this was primarily related to million used to repurchase the remaining par amount of our notes  million of principal payments on other debt obligations  including the million bridge loan  million related to payments on capital leases  and million related to other financing activities  including million in treasury share repurchases associated with management compensation incentive plans 
we received the million proceeds of the bridge loan in january  and repaid the bridge loan in full upon receipt of our federal income tax refund in february net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
this was primarily related to million used to repurchase a portion of the notes  million repaid on credit facilities and million of principal payments on other debt obligations 
these debt payments were offset by the million proceeds received related to the spare parts loan 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
during  we received million in debt proceeds  primarily related to the million credit facility 
this was offset by million of principal payments on debt obligations  million used to repurchase our series a preferred share from northwest  and million used in other financing activities 
guarantees and indemnifications 
we had million and million invested in demand deposit accounts and in other similar instruments at december  and  respectively 
these deposit accounts are used as collateral for standby letter of credit facilities that we maintain for various vendors 
as of december  and  we had million and million of standby letters of credit outstanding  respectively 
we are party to numerous contracts and real estate leases in which it is common for us to agree to indemnify third parties for tort liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the contract or occupancy of the leased premises 
in some cases  this indemnity extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties  but usually excludes any liabilities caused by their gross negligence or willful misconduct 
additionally  we typically indemnify the lessors and related third parties for any environmental liability that arises out of or relates to our leased premises 
in our aircraft lease and loan agreements  we typically indemnify the prime lessor  financing parties  trustees acting on their behalf and other related parties against liabilities that arise from the manufacture  design  ownership  financing  use  operation and maintenance of the aircraft and for tort liability  whether or not these liabilities arise out of or relate to the negligence of these indemnified parties  except for their gross negligence or willful misconduct 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources continued we expect that we would be covered by insurance subject to deductibles for most tort liabilities and related indemnities described above with respect to real estate we lease and aircraft we operate 
we do not expect the potential amount of future payments under the foregoing indemnities and agreements to be material 
off balance sheet arrangements 
none of our operating lease obligations are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
we are responsible for all maintenance  insurance and other costs associated with these leased assets  however  the lease agreements do not include a residual value guarantee  fixed price purchase option or other similar guarantees 
we have no other material off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and the comparability of such reported information over different reporting periods 
the sec has defined critical accounting estimates as those estimates and assumptions that are material to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management s subjective and complex judgments necessary to account for highly uncertain matters that may be susceptible to change 
management has discussed the development of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented above relating to them 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note  significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   which are included in item of this form k 
revenue recognition nature of estimates required passenger and ground handling revenues are recognized when service is provided 
under our contract and pro rate flying agreements with our code share partners  revenue is considered earned when the flight is completed 
additionally  our operating agreements include the ability to earn incentive revenue 
the calculation of these revenues involves the use of estimates that can be subject to differing analysis of the related operating metrics or interpretation of the related contractual provisions 
in some instances  uncertainty exists as to the party responsible for causing a negative effect on the relevant operating metric 
our revenues could be affected by several factors  including changes to the code share agreements  contract modifications resulting from contract renegotiations  and our ability to earn incentive payments contemplated under applicable agreements 
also  in the event we have a reimbursement dispute with a major partner at a quarterly or annual financial statement date due to matters such as differing interpretations of the underlying operating agreement  we evaluate the dispute under our established revenue recognition criteria and  provided the revenue recognition criteria have been met  we recognize revenue for that period based on our estimate of the resolution of the dispute 
accordingly  we are required to exercise judgment and use assumptions in the application of our revenue recognition policy 
assumptions and approach used our operating revenues are calculated based on our interpretation of the underlying code share agreements and our analysis of the related operating metrics 
effect if different assumptions used while in practice these kinds of discrepancies are typically quickly resolved with our partners usually within the following month  should our interpretation of the agreement or analysis of the relevant operating metrics differ materially from those of our code share partners and our interpretations fail to prevail  our revenue could be materially understated or overstated 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates continued fair value measurements nature of estimates required during  we reached an agreement to sell our portfolio of ars to the financial institution that had originally sold the ars to us the ars settlement 
the ars settlement provides that for a period of three years from the date of the ars settlement  we have the right to repurchase all or a portion of the ars at the same discount to par the bank paid to us under the ars settlement the ars call options 
we determined the fair value of the ars call options to be million and million at december  and  respectively 
the ars call options are classified as investments on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
as described in note  investments and fair value measurements  of item of this form k  we have categorized the fair value for these assets as level financial instruments  which are those with little to no observable inputs or market data  which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions to use in the determination of fair value 
assumptions and approach used we determined the fair value of our ars call options utilizing the assistance of a third party valuation specialist 
for each of our ars call options  a discounted cash flow dcf analysis was prepared to determine the estimated fair values 
based on the results of this assessment  we record any change in the fair value of the ars call options as a mark to market adjustment in the consolidated statement of operations 
effect if different assumptions used had we used different dcf assumptions  the value of the ars call options could have been materially different than the recorded value 
goodwill and other long lived assets goodwill nature of estimates required we perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and  if certain events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss may have been incurred  on an interim basis 
the scheduled annual impairment test date for our goodwill is october factors considered important when determining the impairment of goodwill include items affecting the cash flows of the reporting segment  significant changes in the underlying business strategy or operational environment  material ongoing industry or economic trends  or other factors 
any changes in the key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities could result in an impairment charge 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  in goodwill 
at october  and  we performed the annual impairment test of our goodwill  which did not result in an impairment charge in either period 
as described in note  significant accounting policies  and note  impairment and aircraft retirement costs  of item of this form k  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in for all of the goodwill recognized in the acquisition of colgan 
as described in note  acquisition of mesaba  in item of this form k  we recorded goodwill of approximately million related to the acquisition of mesaba  which is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  assumptions and approach used our cash flow estimates are based on our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
our determination of a reporting unit s fair value is based upon our perspective of industry trends  market rates  and market transactions 
other assumptions include the appropriate discount rate  which represents our weighted average cost of capital 
factors indicating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of our common stock and declines in our current or projected future net income 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates continued effect if different assumptions used if the results of these evaluations determined that impairment has occurred  an impairment charge could affect earnings by as much as the carrying value 
if the current economic market conditions decline and if there is a prolonged period of weakness in the business environment and airline sector  our businesses may be adversely affected  which could result in future impairment of our goodwill 
long lived assets nature of estimates required our long lived assets consist of property and equipment and intangible assets 
approximately of our total assets are invested in property and equipment  which will continue to increase as we acquire additional aircraft to support our capacity purchase agreement with united 
we capitalize only those costs that meet the definition of capital assets under accounting standards 
accordingly  repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of an asset or are not part of the cost of acquiring the asset are expensed as incurred 
the depreciation of our property and equipment over their estimated useful lives and the determination of any salvage values requires management to make judgments about future events 
assumptions and approach used in accounting for long lived assets including intangible assets with definite lives  we must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
because we utilize most of our property and equipment over relatively long periods  we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset 
in addition to considering our planned use of long lived assets  when necessary  such as when making estimates related to our new aircraft for which there is little historical data available  we engage airline industry specialists to assist with the determination of relevant estimates 
when appropriate  we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment 
factors that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset s  a significant change in the long lived asset s physical condition  and cash flows associated with the use of the long lived asset 
the accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with its estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value 
when considering whether or not impairment of long lived assets exists  we group similar assets together at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and compare the undiscounted cash flows for the entire group of assets to the carrying value of the same group of assets 
asset groupings are typically done at the fleet or contract level 
we have not experienced any significant impairment of assets to be held and used 
however  from time to time we make decisions to remove certain long lived assets from service based on projections of reduced capacity needs  and those decisions may result in an impairment charge 
there were no material asset impairment charges recognized in   or effect if different assumptions used periodic re evaluations  which can be significant  could be caused by changes to our maintenance program  changes in the utilization of the aircraft  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used similar aircraft 
generally  these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization expense  as required by accounting standards and  ultimately  the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset 
any impairment charge could affect earnings by as much as the carrying values of the assets 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates continued spare parts and supplies nature of estimates required inventories  expendable parts  and maintenance supplies relating to flight equipment are carried at cost and are expensed when the inventory is used 
a fleet retirement reserve is provided over the remaining estimated useful life of the related aircraft equipment  for spare parts expected to be on hand at the date the aircraft are retired from service  plus allowances for spare parts currently identified as obsolete or excess 
we will continue to modify these estimates as our fleet ages 
the adequacy of our fleet retirement reserve requires a high degree of judgment 
assumptions and approach used our fleet retirement reserve related to inventory is provided over the remaining useful life of the related aircraft  plus allowance for spare parts currently identified as excess 
part of the calculation for this reserve is based on historical experience 
in addition  we may reserve for additional amounts when we deem parts as excess inventory 
effect if different assumptions used as of december   our fleet retirement reserve related to our spare parts and supplies was approximately million 
if we increase the reserve by  the impact on pre tax income is immaterial 
purchase accounting measurements nature of estimates required on july   we completed the acquisition of mesaba 
we accounted for the acquisition in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic  business combinations  whereby the purchase price paid is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from mesaba based on their estimated fair values as of the closing date 
for more information  see note  acquisition of mesaba  in item of this form k 
assumptions and approach used the fair value of spare parts  flight equipment  and other equipment was determined using a market based valuation approach  using observable prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable assets 
the fair value of property and buildings  including a leased build to suit hangar  was calculated under a replacement cost approach  using inputs from a third party 
the useful lives of these assets were based upon our estimated useful life for each asset 
to value the intangible assets acquired in the acquisition  we used an income based approach 
for our customer contract intangibles specifically  we used an excess earnings model  which included significant unobservable inputs  including the projected revenues and expenses under each contract 
we utilized a weighted average cost of capital wacc as the discount rate in our assumptions under the income approach 
the wacc was based on the rate of return investors would expect to earn on investments with a similar risk profile 
effect if different assumptions used due to the assumptions used by management  we recorded goodwill  intangible assets  and deferred liabilities of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  which are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  any modifications in the assumptions used by management in purchase accounting  which management had completed as of december   could materially alter our consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the estimates discussed above  we have made certain other estimates that  while not involving the same degree of judgment  are important to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
we continually evaluate our accounting policies and the estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
our estimates reflect our best judgment after giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
therefore  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since the majority of our contracts are capacity purchase agreements  our exposure to market risks such as commodity price risk eg  aircraft fuel prices is primarily limited to our pro rate operations  which comprised of our consolidated revenues for year ended december  with our acquisition of colgan and our contracts with delta and united that include the purchase of aircraft  we are exposed to commodity price and interest rate risks as discussed below 
commodity price risk our pro rate operations include exposure to certain market risks primarily related to aircraft fuel  which recently has been volatile 
aircraft fuel expense is a significant expense for any air carrier  and even marginal changes in the cost of fuel greatly affect a carrier s profitability 
standard industry contracts do not generally provide protection against fuel price increases  nor do they ensure availability of supply 
while our capacity purchase agreements require that fuel be provided to us at no cost  thereby reducing our overall exposure to fuel price fluctuations  our pro rate code share agreements with us airways and united expose us to fuel price risk 
slightly offsetting our fuel risk  one of our agreements with united provides for an adjustment to the pro rate revenue we receive from united based on projected changes in fuel prices 
for the projected annualized fuel consumption related to our pro rate agreements  each ten percent change in the price of aircraft fuel from current levels would result in a change in annual fuel costs of approximately million 
to mitigate the financial risk associated with dramatic short term increases in fuel prices  we utilize a fuel hedging program using out of the money aircraft fuel call options for a portion of our anticipated fuel consumption needs from january through june see note  hedging activities  in item of this form k for more information pertaining to our fuel hedging program 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk from the time of entering into an aircraft purchase commitment until the delivery of aircraft  at which time we receive permanent  fixed rate financing for each aircraft 
in january  we entered into a purchase agreement for firm q aircraft with bombardier  and in december we increased our firm deliveries for by one additional aircraft 
eight q aircraft were delivered during the third and fourth quarter  while the remaining eight q aircraft will deliver during should interest rates rise by basis points before we take delivery  aggregate interest expense in the first year of financing would increase by approximately million 
to mitigate the financial risk of significant increases in interest rates prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt associated with q aircraft deliveries  we initiated an interest rate hedging program  utilizing out of the money interest rate swaptions options to enter into pay fixed interest rate swaps 
see note  hedging activities  in item of this form k for more information regarding our interest rate hedging program
