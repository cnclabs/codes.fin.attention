overview key financial results for were as follows our consolidated revenue increased by approximately  or million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  consisting of increased fiery  inkjet  and apps revenue of   and million  respectively 
fiery revenue increased by primarily due to strong demand for our digital color controllers in the high end production market 
recent new and refreshed oem engine launches contributed to the revenue increase 
inkjet revenue increased by primarily due to gs series printer sales and significantly increased uv printer and ink sales 
coming out of the downturn  the transition from solvent to uv printers has accelerated 
uv ink and service part sales increased reflecting the high utilization that our uv printers are experiencing in the field  partially offset by decreased solvent printer installed base demand  also measured by solvent ink usage and service parts 
prior year inkjet revenue had decreased significantly due to tightened credit markets  which made it difficult for our customers to obtain financing in apps revenue increased by due to revenue realized from our recently acquired radius packaging software  in addition to increased pace and web to print revenue 
gross profits were of revenue in  which was comparable to the gross profit percentage 
improving inkjet gross profits due to fixed manufacturing costs being spread over higher inkjet revenue  higher selling prices for new products launched in  and favorable product mix shift toward higher margin printers  partially offset by the provision for excess solvent inventories and related end of life purchases resulting from the accelerating transition from solvent to uv technology and engineering design modifications to improve quality and reduce warranty exposure 

table of contents operating expenses as a percent of revenue decreased from in to in primarily due to decreased amortization of identified intangibles  restructuring and other  and asset impairment 
decreased intangible amortization resulted from full amortization of vutek existing technology in  partially offset by increased intangible amortization in due to the radius acquisition 
restructuring and other and asset impairment decreased in as compared with primarily due to higher personnel related restructuring charges in and the write off of equipment and non cancellable purchase orders incurred relating to a planned product that was cancelled in interest and other income expense decreased by million primarily driven by realized and unrealized foreign exchange losses in and decreased interest income on our investments  offset by losses on equity method investments in the million foreign exchange fluctuation primarily resulted from recovery in the value of the euro and  to a lesser extent  from recovery in the value of the british pound during interest income on our investments decreased by million in resulting from lower investment balances and interest rates as we sold a substantial portion of our investment portfolio during to generate cash for the repurchase of our common stock under the accelerated share repurchase asr during the first quarter of and the modified dutch auction tender offer during the fourth quarter of we incurred losses on equity method investments of million in in  we recorded a tax benefit of million on a pre tax operating loss of million compared to a tax provision of million recorded in on pre tax operating income of million 
the change from to primarily related to the benefit realized from the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits resulting from the expiration of us federal and state statutes of limitations in compared to the charge related to the sale of building and land in results of operations the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenue for   and these operating results are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

table of contents revenue we classify our revenue  gross profit  assets  and liabilities in accordance with our three operating segments as follows fiery includes products  services  and technology  which transform digital copiers and printers into high performance networked printing devices  and is made up of stand alone and embedded controllers  bundled solutions  and design licensed solutions primarily for the office market and commercial printing markets 
this operating segment includes our fiery series external print servers and embedded servers  splash and micropress  color and black white server products  software options for fiery products  including proofing and scanning solutions  and parts 
inkjet consists of sales of super wide and wide format inkjet printers  industrial inkjet printers  ink  parts  and service revenue from the vutek  jetrion  and rastek businesses 
apps consists of software technology focused on printing workflow  pmis  e commerce  and job tracking tools 
our revenue by operating segment for the years ended december    and was as follows in thousands years ended december  change over over fiery inkjet apps total revenue proofing software revenue previously reported in the apps operating segment of and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  has been revised to conform to the year ended december  presentation  reflecting the reclassification of proofing software from the apps to the fiery operating segment 
total revenue for the years ended december  and has not changed 
overview revenue was   and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  resulting in a increase in compared with and a decrease in compared with the million increase in compared with consisted of increased fiery  inkjet  and apps revenue of   and million  respectively 
the million decrease in compared with consisted of decreased fiery  inkjet  and apps revenue of   and million  respectively 
fiery revenue fiery revenue increased by million  or  in compared with  which was primarily driven by strong demand for our digital color controllers in the high end production market 
recent new and refreshed oem engine launches contributed to the revenue increase 
fiery revenue declined by million  or  in compared with  which was primarily driven by reduced demand from our oem customers due to a weak global economy in  as well as oem customers reducing their inventory levels 
the tightening global credit markets also contributed to the revenue decline as it remained relatively more difficult for some of the customers of our oems to obtain financing 

table of contents inkjet revenue inkjet revenue increased by million  or  in compared with  primarily due to gs series printer sales and significantly increased uv printer and ink sales 
coming out of the downturn  the transition from solvent to uv printers has accelerated 
uv ink and service part sales increased reflecting the high utilization that our uv printers are experiencing in the field  partially offset by decreased solvent printer installed base demand  also measured by solvent ink usage and service parts 
inkjet revenue declined by million  or  in compared with  primarily driven by a weak global economy and tight credit markets as some of our customers were challenged in their attempts to obtain financing to purchase our products 
in addition  the softening of the retail sector and related demand for signs  billboards  and point of purchase displays impacted our customers businesses and their demand for ink  which resulted in a lower demand for our ink products beginning in the fourth quarter of apps revenue apps revenue increased by million  or in compared with due to revenue realized from our recently acquired radius packaging software  in addition to increased pace and web to print revenue 
apps revenue declined by million  or in compared with  which did not decline as significantly on a percentage basis compared with our other operating segments due to the benefits realized from the pace acquisition  which closed during the third quarter of  and the recurring portion of apps revenue 
apps recurring revenue includes subscription revenue and maintenance fees 
the apps operating segment includes our pmis software  including monarch  pace  psi  logic  printsmith and printflow  our web based order entry and order management software  and radius  our print management packaging software 
in july  to establish our presence in the packaging industry  we acquired golflane  a uk private limited company  the parent holding company of radius  a leading provider of pmis to the packaging industry 
in  we reorganized our pmis product lines after the acquisition of pace to better leverage our investment in the apps operating segment and concentrate our resources on fewer products 
as a result  we no longer sell psi and logic to new customers and have reduced our investment in the development of these products 
we currently sell printsmith to small print for pay and small commercial print shops  pace to medium and large commercial print shops  display graphics providers  in plant printing operations  and government printing operations  monarch to large commercial  publication  and digital print shops  and radius to the packaging industry 
our revenue by geographic area for the years ended december    and was as follows in thousands for the years ended december  change over over americas emea japan other international locations total revenue revenue rebounded in across all regions and all operating segments within each region 
the operating segment geographic breakdown in remained comparable to comparing to  americas  emea  japan  and other international location revenue increased by    and  respectively 
new fiery and inkjet product launches have mitigated the impact of the weak economic environment 

table of contents revenue declined in across all regions 
in the individual regions  fiery and inkjet declined in the americas and emea  while fiery declined in japan 
americas revenue increased from of total revenue in to of total revenue in and emea revenue decreased from of total revenue in to of total revenue in  as a result of stronger sales in the americas  as compared with emea  in as compared with americas revenue decreased by in compared to  primarily due to weakness in fiery sales caused by reduced demand from our oem customers due to the slow economy and weak inkjet sales due to the tight global credit markets and the decline in global marketing spending 
likewise  the soft retail sector and the related demand impacted our customers businesses 
emea revenue decreased in compared to also due to the slow economy and tight credit markets in europe 
japan revenue decreased in compared to as a result of reduced fiery demand 
other international location revenue decreased by in compared to mainly driven by lower sales due to the impact of macro economic conditions 
in the individual regions  fiery revenue represented    and of revenue in the americas  emea  japan and other international locations  respectively  compared with    and of revenue 
inkjet revenue represented    and of revenue in the americas  emea  japan  and other international locations  respectively  compared with    and of revenue 
apps revenue represented    and of revenue in the americas  emea  japan  and other international locations  respectively  compared with    and of revenue 
within each geographic region  proofing software revenue previously reported in the apps operating segment for the year ended december  has been revised to conform to the year ended december  presentation  reflecting the reclassification of proofing software from the apps to the fiery operating segment 
total revenue for the year ended december  has not changed 
shipments to some of our oem customers are made to centralized purchasing and manufacturing locations  which in turn ship to other locations  making it more difficult to obtain accurate geographical shipment data 
accordingly  we believe that export sales of our products into each region may differ from what is reported 
we expect that sales outside of the us will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
a substantial portion of our revenue over the years has been attributable to sales through our oem customers and independent distributor channels 
canon and xerox each contributed over of our revenue individually and together accounted for approximately   and of our revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our dependency on our oem customers has been decreasing  although the oem dependency percentage has leveled off in recent years 
in   and    and  respectively  of revenue were from non oem sources 
over time  we expect the oem percentage to continue to decline 
because sales of our printer and copier related products constitute a significant portion of our revenue and there is a limited number of oems producing copiers and printers in sufficient volume to be attractive customers for us  we expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively small number of oem customers for a significant portion of our controller revenue in future periods 
our decreasing revenue reliance on our major oem customers is attributable to the increase in the inkjet and apps operating segments where most revenue is generated from sales to distributors and direct customers 
no assurance can be given that our relationships with these and other significant oem customers will continue or that we will be successful in increasing the number of our oem customers or the size of our existing oem relationships 
several of our oem customers have reduced their purchases from us at various times in the past and any customer could do so in the future as there are no contractual obligations with most of our oems to purchase our products in significant amounts  or at all 
such reductions have occurred in the past and could in the 
table of contents future have a significant negative impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we expect that if we increase our revenue from inkjet and apps products  the percentage of our revenue that comes from individual oem customers will decrease 
we intend to continue to develop new products and technologies for each of our product lines including new generations of server and controller products  super wide and wide format printers  and other new product lines  and to distribute those new products to or through current and new oem customers  distributors  and end users in and beyond 
no assurance can be given that the introduction or market acceptance of current or future products will be successful 
if sales of our products do not grow over time in absolute terms  or if we are not able to meet demand for higher unit volumes  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
there can be no assurance that any products that we introduce in the future will successfully compete  be accepted by the market  or otherwise effectively replace the volume of revenue and or income from our older products 
market acceptance of our software products  products acquired through acquisitions  and other products cannot be assured 
in addition  we may experience loss of sales  unexpected costs  or adverse impact on relationships with customers or suppliers as a result of acquisitions 
we also believe that in addition to the factors described above  price reductions for our products will affect revenue in the future 
we have previously reduced  and in the future will likely change  prices for our products 
depending on the price elasticity of demand for our products  the pricing and quality of competitive products  and other economic and competitive conditions  price changes have had  and may in the future have  an adverse impact on our revenue and profit

total gross profit for the years ended december  and has not changed 
overview our gross profit percentages were   and for the years ended   and  respectively 
all three operating segments contributed to the small increase in the gross profit percentage in  as compared with the decrease in the gross profit percentage in of  as compared with in  was primarily due to the reduced inkjet gross profit percentage from in to in inkjet revenue was   and of total revenue in   and  respectively 
our inkjet operating segment is growing as a percentage of revenue  which decreases the overall gross profit percentage 
the inkjet gross profit percentage is lower than each of the fiery and apps gross profit percentages 
our ink sales represent a continuing revenue stream to existing customers that will increase if our inkjet customers production increases 
ink margins are typically higher than overall inkjet margins 
fiery gross profit the fiery gross profit percentage increased from in to in primarily due to a mix shift toward stand alone servers as stand alone servers have higher margins than embedded servers  along with costs to launch new products 
the decrease in the fiery gross profit percentage from in to in was primarily mix related as embedded servers have lower margins than stand alone servers  along with costs to launch new products 
fiery revenue decreased as a percentage of total revenue from in to in inkjet gross profit the inkjet gross profit percentage increased from in to in improving inkjet gross profit due to fixed manufacturing costs spread over higher inkjet revenue  higher selling prices for new products launched in  and favorable product mix shift toward higher margin printers  partially offset by the million provision for excess solvent inventories and related end of life purchases resulting from the accelerating transition from solvent to uv technology and engineering design modifications to improve quality and reduce warranty exposure 
the decrease in the inkjet gross profit percentage from in to in resulted from relatively fixed manufacturing costs spread over lower revenue and  to a lesser extent  costs associated with the consolidation of our ink production into a single facility to streamline the production process and reduce ink production costs 
inkjet fixed manufacturing costs decreased as compared with the prior year  but not by enough to offset the revenue decline 

table of contents apps gross profit the increase in the apps gross profit percentage from in to in was primarily due to increased revenue 
apps revenue was of total revenue in  which was comparable to  but the increase in revenue dollars aided the gross profit percentage due to the fixed component included within the apps cost of revenue 
the increase in the apps gross profit percentage from in to in was primarily due to operating efficiencies  which continue to be achieved through the pace acquisition  which closed during the third quarter of our overall gross profit percentage was also aided by increased apps revenue as a percentage of total revenue from in to in if our product mix changes significantly  our gross profit will fluctuate 
in addition  gross profit can be impacted by a variety of other factors 
these factors include market prices achieved on our current and future products  availability and pricing of key components including dram  processors  and print heads  subcontractor manufacturing costs  product mix  distribution channel  geographic mix  product transition results  new product introductions  competition  and general economic conditions in the us and abroad 
consequently  gross profit may fluctuate from period to period 
in addition  if we reduce prices  gross profit could be lower 
many of our products and sub assemblies are manufactured by subcontract manufacturers that purchase most of the necessary components 
if our subcontract manufacturers cannot obtain necessary components at favorable prices  we could experience increased product costs 
we purchase certain components directly  including processors  memory  certain asics  and software licensed from various sources  including adobe postscript software 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expenses were   and million  respectively  for the years ended december    and we account for stock based payment awards  in accordance with asc  which requires stock based compensation expense to be recognized based on the fair value of such awards on the date of grant 
we amortize stock based compensation expense on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period 
stock based compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche as though the award were  in substance  multiple awards 
this has the impact of greater stock based compensation expense during the initial years of the vesting period based on the grant date fair value 
stock based compensation expense decreased by million  or  from to due to fewer equity awards granted in stock based compensation expense decreased by million  or  from to equity awards issued during and the fourth quarter of were significant due to the fact that no equity awards were granted during the first months of because of the stock option review being conducted at that time

decreased intangible amortization resulted from full amortization of vutek existing technology in  partially offset by increased intangible amortization in due to the radius acquisition 
restructuring and other and asset impairment decreased in as compared with primarily due to higher personnel related restructuring charges in and the write off of equipment and non cancellable purchase orders incurred relating to a planned product that was cancelled in operating expenses as a percent of revenue decreased from in to in primarily due to impairment charges recorded on goodwill and certain long lived assets as a result of the impairment analysis conducted during the fourth quarter of and ipr d charges related to our acquisitions of pace systems group  inc pace and raster printers  inc raster 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with personnel  consulting  and prototype materials 
research and development expenses for the years ended december    and were  or of revenue  million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue  respectively 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or  in as compared with personnel related expenses decreased by million primarily due to salary reductions in place for most of  partially offset by increased radius head count and increased variable compensation due to improved profitability and decreased utilization of vacation balances 
prototypes and non recurring engineering expenses decreased by million 
stock based compensation expense decreased by million due to the timing of equity awards issued during the last twelve months amortized under the graded vesting method 
the remaining million reduction in research and development expenses relates to facility downsizing achieved during the last year in the apps operating segment and in japan 
cost reductions achieved during the year ended december  are net of increased research and development spending due to the radius acquisition  which closed during the third quarter of research and development expenses decreased by million  or  in as compared with personnel related expenses decreased by million primarily due to head count  salary  variable compensation  consulting  and travel reductions

cost reductions achieved during the year ended december  are net of increased research and development spending due to the pace and raster acquisitions  each of which closed during the latter half of research and development head count was   and as of december    and  respectively 
we expect that if the us dollar remains volatile against other currencies  research and development expenses reported in us dollars could fluctuate 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include personnel expenses  trade shows  marketing programs  promotional materials  sales commissions  travel and entertainment  depreciation  and costs associated with sales offices in the us  europe  asia  and other international locations

sales and marketing expenses decreased by million  or  in as compared with personnel related expenses decreased by million primarily due to head count  salary  and variable compensation reductions 
travel expenses decreased by million due to reduced travel to trade shows in the current year 
marketing and trade show expenses decreased by million due to more efficient spending and the inclusion of drupa trade show expenses during the second quarter of drupa is a european trade show that is held once every four years 
stock based compensation expense decreased by million due to the timing of equity awards issued during the last twelve months amortized under the graded vesting method 
the remaining million reduction in sales and marketing expenses relates to facility downsizing achieved during the last year and a focused effort on cost reduction in all areas 
sales and marketing head count was   and of december    and  respectively 
over time  our sales and marketing expenses may increase in absolute terms  if revenue increases in future periods  as we continue to actively promote our products and introduce new products and services 
we expect that if the us dollar remains volatile against other currencies  sales and marketing expenses reported in us dollars could fluctuate 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs associated with administrative personnel  legal  and finance expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the years ended december    and were million  or of revenue  million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue  respectively 

table of contents general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in as compared with personnel related expenses increased by million primarily due to variable compensation due to improved profitability  decreased utilization of vacation balances  increased recruiting  and increased travel  partially offset by reduced salaries and head count through most of the year 
the increase in the fair value of the radius earnout explained an additional million of the increase in personnel related expenses 
legal expenses decreased by million as significant cases were settled in the prior year and more efficient spending 
stock based compensation expense increased by million due to the timing of equity awards issued during the last twelve months amortized under the graded vesting method 
consistent with the new accounting guidance with respect to business combinations  acquisition related costs of million were expensed during the nine months ended september  in connection with our acquisition of radius

stock based compensation expense decreased by million due to the timing of equity awards issued during the last twelve months amortized under the graded vesting method 
these decreases were partially offset by a million legal reserve reduction  net of settlements 
the remaining million reduction in general and administrative expenses is due to focused effort on cost reduction in all areas 
amortization of identified intangibles amortization of identified intangibles for the years ended december    and was million  or of revenue  million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue  respectively 
the decrease of million in  as compared with  is due to several intangible assets becoming fully amortized in  partially offset by amortization of identified intangibles in the radius acquisition  which closed during the third quarter of  respectively  and a full year of shortened useful lives of certain trademarks primarily within the inkjet operating segment 
the decrease of million in  as compared with  is due to several intangible assets becoming fully amortized in  partially offset by a full year of amortization of intangible assets identified as components of the pace and raster acquisitions  which closed during the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  and shortened useful lives of certain trademarks primarily within the inkjet operating segment 
ipr d in  we incurred ipr d expenses of million as a result of our acquisitions of pace and raster 
no ipr d expenses were incurred with respect to our acquisition of radius because all research and development efforts were in the deployment stage at the acquisition date 
if radius research and development efforts had progressed beyond the deployment stage  such ipr d expenses would have been capitalized as an intangible asset at the acquisition date in accordance with the new acquisition accounting guidance that became effective in restructuring and other during the years ended december    and  cost reduction actions were taken to lower our quarterly operating expense run rate as we analyzed our cost structure 
we announced restructuring plans to better align our costs with revenue levels due to the economic environment and to re align our cost structure following the acquisitions of radius in and pace in restructuring and other consists primarily of restructuring  severance  facility downsizing  and acquisition integration expenses 

table of contents restructuring and other costs for the years ended december    and totaled   and million  respectively 
restructuring and other charges include severance costs of   and  million related to head count reductions of   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
severance costs include severance payments  related employee benefits  retention bonuses  and outplacement or relocation costs 
restructuring and other includes a million charge resulting from a decrease in estimated sublease income necessitated by continuing weakness in the commercial real estate market where these facilities are located  costs to downsize five facilities in  and integration expenses resulting from the radius acquisition

interest and other income expense  net  for the years ended december    and was   and million  respectively 
interest income for the years ended december    and was   and million  respectively 
the decrease of million from to and million from to was driven by lower investment balances and interest rates as we sold a substantial portion of our investment portfolio during to generate cash for the repurchase of our common stock under the asr during the first quarter of and the modified dutch auction tender offer during the fourth quarter of  and to generate cash for the redemption of our convertible senior debentures  which occurred in june we had net realized gains losses on our marketable securities of   and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  consisting of gains on our investments in marketable securities of   and million  respectively  offset by losses on our equity method investments of   and million  respectively 
interest expense consists of interest and debt amortization expenses related to our convertible senior debentures 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million 
the million outstanding balance of our convertible senior debentures was redeemed on june  realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains losses were   and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these fluctuations primarily result from recovery in the value of the euro and  to a lesser extent  from recovery in the value of the british pound during the respective periods 
gain on sale of building and land during the first quarter of  we sold a portion of the foster city  california campus for million 
under the agreement  we sold the approximately  square foot building at velocity way  as well as approximately acres of related land and certain other assets related to the property 
the cost of the land  building  improvements  and direct transaction costs were included in the determination of the million gain on sale of building and land 
goodwill impairment we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each year according to the provisions of asc  goodwill intangibles and other subsequent measurement 
a two step impairment test of goodwill is required 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not 
table of contents required 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is required to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit  excluding goodwill  from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss must be recorded equal to the difference 
based on the outcome of conditions existing during the fourth quarter of  we determined that a triggering event requiring an interim impairment analysis had occurred relating to the inkjet reporting unit 
the resulting impairment analysis resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of the goodwill valuation analysis was performed based on our respective reporting units fiery  inkjet  and apps which are consistent with our operating segments identified in note segment information  geographic data  and major customers of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we determined the fair value of the inkjet and apps reporting units as of december  by equally weighting the market and income approaches 
the fair value of the fiery reporting unit was determined based on the market approach 
under the market approach  we estimated fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings of comparable companies 
under the income approach  we measured fair value of the inkjet and apps reporting units based on a projected cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
to identify suitable comparable companies under the market approach  consideration was given to the financial condition and operating performance of the reporting unit being evaluated relative to companies operating in the same or similar businesses  potentially subject to corresponding economic  environmental  and political factors and considered to be reasonable investment alternatives 
consideration was given to the investment characteristics of the subject company relative to those of similar publicly traded companies ie  guideline companies 
guideline company stocks are actively traded 
in applying the public company market multiple method pcmmm  valuation multiples were derived from historical and projected operating data of guideline companies and applied to the appropriate operating data of our reporting units to arrive at an indication of fair value 
five  four  and seven suitable guideline companies were identified for the fiery  inkjet  and apps reporting units  respectively 
based on our valuation results  we have determined that the fair values of our reporting units exceed their carrying values 
fiery  inkjet  and apps fair values are   and million  respectively  which exceed carrying value by   and  respectively 
because the fair value of the fiery reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value as of december  as indicated by the market based valuation  management did not deem it necessary to further supplement the bases for this judgment 
while the fair value of the inkjet and apps reporting units exceeded their carrying values based on the market based valuation  management determined to further examine whether an impairment had occurred given the inkjet impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of and the relatively small excess of the fair value of the apps reporting unit over its carrying value 
we reviewed the factors that could trigger an impairment charge and completed an income based impairment analysis 
as part of this process  we engaged a third party valuation firm to aid management in its analysis 
all estimates  key assumptions  and forecasts were either provided by or reviewed by us 
while we chose to utilize a third party valuation firm  the impairment analysis and related valuations represent the conclusions of management and not the conclusions or statements of any third party 
solely for purposes of establishing inputs for the income approach to assess the fair value of the inkjet and apps reporting units  we made the following assumptions despite improved inkjet performance in  resulting from an improving economic climate in and new product introductions beginning in and continuing in  inkjet revenues remained below results 
apps revenue in exceeded revenue due to improved apps performance resulting from the radius acquisition and continued strong performance from the pace acquisition 

table of contents inkjet revenue will exceed revenue levels in achieving a normalized long term growth model between and long term industry growth past our discounted cash flow projections for the inkjet and apps reporting units were based on six year financial forecasts  which were based on annual financial forecasts developed internally by management for use in managing our business and through discussions with the independent valuation firm engaged by us 
the significant assumptions utilized in these six year forecasts included annual revenue growth rates ranging from to  which equates to compound annual growth rates of and for the inkjet and apps reporting units  respectively 
future cash flows were discounted to present value using a mid year convention and a discount rate of 
terminal values were calculated using the gordon growth methodology with a long term growth rate of 
the sum of the fair values of the fiery  inkjet  and apps reporting units was reconciled to our current market capitalization based on our stock price plus an estimated control premium 
significant assumptions used in determining fair values of the reporting units include the determination of appropriate market comparables  estimated multiples of revenue and ebitda that a willing buyer is likely to pay  estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay  gross profit  and operating expenses 
inkjet gross profit is assumed to increase as fixed production costs are absorbed by increasing inkjet volumes  while apps gross profit is assumed to remain consistent during the forecast horizon 
gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue over the six year forecast horizon are assumed to approximate percentages realized by the guideline companies 
to assess the reasonableness of the estimated control premium of  we examined the most similar transactions in relevant industries and determined the average premium indicated by the transactions deemed to be most similar to a hypothetical transaction involving our reporting units 
we examined the weighted average and median control premiums offered in these industries  industry specific control premiums  and specific transaction control premiums to conclude that our estimated control premium is reasonable 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the life of the asset may need to be revised 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  our market capitalization relative to net book value  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets  significant changes in the strategy for our overall business  and our assessment of growth and profitability in each reporting unit over the coming years 
given the uncertainty of the economic environment and the potential impact on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the ongoing economic downturn  or the period or strength of recovery  made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing at december  will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or gross profit rates are not achieved  we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods relating to any of our reporting units  whether in connection with the next annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of or prior to that  if any such change constitutes an interim triggering event 
it is not possible to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
a change in the market multiple impacts the fiery fair value by under the market approach 
because the inkjet and apps fair values were determined using a weighting of the market and income approaches  we 
table of contents reviewed the sensitivity of the discount rate  in addition to the market multiple  in evaluating the sensitivity of the inkjet and apps valuations 
the impact of a change in the market multiple of impacts the inkjet and apps fair values by 
likewise  the impact of a change in the discount rate of one percentage point results in either an increase in the inkjet and apps fair values of or a decrease of 
consequently  we have concluded that no reasonably possible charges would reduce the fair value of the reporting units to such a level that it would cause a failure in step one of the impairment analysis 
long lived asset impairment other investments  included within other assets  consist of equity and debt investments in privately held companies that develop products  markets  and services that are strategic to us 
in substance common stock investments in which we exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies  but do not have a majority voting interest  are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
investments not meeting these requirements are accounted for using the cost method of accounting 
the process of assessing whether a particular equity or debt investment s fair value is less than its carrying cost requires a significant amount of judgment due to the lack of a mature and stable public market for these securities 
in making this judgment  we carefully consider the investee s most recent financial results  cash position  recent cash flow data  projected cash flows both short and long term  financing needs  recent financing rounds  most recent valuation data  the current investing environment  management or ownership changes  and competition 
this analysis is based primarily on information that we request and receive from these privately held companies and is performed on a quarterly basis 
although we evaluate all of our privately held equity and debt investments for impairment based on this criteria  each investment s fair value is only estimated when events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may have a significant effect on its fair value because the fair value of each investment is not readily determinable 
where these factors indicate that the equity investment s fair value is less than its carrying cost  and where we consider such diminution in value to be other than temporary  we record an impairment charge to reduce such equity investment to its estimated fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  we assessed each remaining investment s technology pipeline and market conditions in the industry for the next several years and determined it is no longer probable that they will generate enough positive future cash flows to recover the full carrying amount of the investment 
as such  we recognized an impairment charge of million 
during the second quarter of  we further assessed each remaining investment s ability to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment in accordance with asc based on this assessment  we impaired the remaining carrying value of these investments of million 
we recognized long lived asset impairment charges of   and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  consisting primarily of project abandonment costs related to equipment charges in the inkjet operating segment  assets impaired related to an inkjet facility closure  certain inkjet printer equipment  and the impairment of our remaining equity method investees

unaudited non gaap net income loss to supplement our consolidated financial results prepared under generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we use non gaap measures of net income loss and earnings per diluted share that are gaap net income loss and gaap earnings per diluted share adjusted to exclude certain recurring and non recurring costs  expenses  and gains 
we believe the presentation of non gaap net income loss and non gaap earnings per diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding non cash expenses and significant recurring and non recurring items we believe are important to understanding our financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 
non gaap net income loss and non gaap earnings per diluted share are among the primary indicators used by management as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods and by management and our board of directors to determine whether our operating performance has met specified targets and thresholds 
management uses non gaap net income loss and non gaap earnings per diluted share when evaluating operating performance because they believe the exclusion of the items described below  for which the amounts and or timing may vary significantly depending upon our activities and other factors  facilitates comparability of our operating performance 
we have chosen to provide this information to investors so they can analyze our operating results in the same way that management does and use this information in their assessment of our business and valuation 
we compute non gaap net income loss and non gaap earnings per diluted share by adjusting gaap net income loss and gaap earnings per diluted share to remove the impact of recurring amortization of acquisition related intangibles  stock based compensation expense  as well as restructuring related and non recurring charges and gains and the tax effect of these adjustments 
such non recurring charges and gains include provision for excess solvent inventories and related end of life purchases  project abandonment costs  asset impairment charges  certain legal settlements  sale of certain real estate assets  acquisition related transaction costs and legal expenses  and costs to integrate such acquisitions into our business 
examples of these excluded items include recurring charges and gains  including amortization of acquisition related intangibles 
identified intangible assets acquired to date are being amortized on a straight line basis over to years 
stock based compensation expense is recognized in accordance with asc non recurring charges and gains  including provision for excess solvent inventories and related end of life purchases resulting from the accelerating transition from solvent to uv technology

tax effect of non gaap adjustments 
after removing the non gaap adjustments  we applied the principles of asc  income taxes  to estimate the non gaap income tax provision in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
we have excluded the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of million  and interest accrued on prior year tax reserves of million  from our non gaap net income for the year ended december   to facilitate comparability of our operating performance from period to period 
these non gaap measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for gaap measures and may be materially different from other non gaap measures  including similarly titled non gaap measures  used by other companies 
the presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation from  as a substitute for  or superior to  net income loss or earnings per diluted share prepared in accordance with gaap 
non gaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results 
we expect to continue to incur expenses of a nature similar to the non gaap adjustments described above  and exclusion of these items from our non gaap net income loss and non gaap earnings per diluted share should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual  infrequent  or non recurring

we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  purchase commitments  revenue recognition  and contingencies on an ongoing basis 
the estimates are based on historical and current experience  the impact of the current economic environment  and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources

table of contents revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from product revenue  which includes hardware controllers  design licensed solutions including upgrades  inkjet printers including components replaced under maintenance agreements  and ink  software licensing and development  and royalties 
we also receive service revenue from software license maintenance agreements  customer support  training  and consulting 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition sab and when applicable  asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  for the sale of controllers  printers  and ink 
as such  revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
products generally must be shipped against written purchase orders 
we use either a binding purchase order or signed contract as evidence of an arrangement 
sales to some of our oem customers are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with a binding purchase order 
sales to our resellers are also evidenced by binding purchase orders or signed contracts and do not generally contain rights of return or price protection 
our arrangements generally do not include product acceptance clauses 
when acceptance is required  revenue is recognized when the product is accepted by the customer 
delivery for hardware generally is complete when title and risk of loss is transferred at point of shipment from manufacturing facilities  or when the product is delivered to the customer s local common carrier 
we also sell products and services using sales arrangements with terms resulting in different timing for revenue recognition as follows if the title and or risk of loss is transferred at a location other than our manufacturing facility  revenue is recognized when title and or risk of loss transfers to the customer  per the terms of the agreement  if title is retained until payment is received  revenue is recognized when title is passed upon receipt of payment  if payment is contingent upon installation  the revenue related to the portion of the payment for installation is deferred until installation is complete  if the sales arrangement is classified as an operating lease  revenue is recognized ratably over the lease term  or if the sales arrangement is a fixed price for performance extending over a long period and our right to receive future payment depends on our future performance in accordance with these agreements  revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the terms of the contract or purchase order 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we may not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we license our software primarily under perpetual licenses 
revenue from software consists of software licensing  post contract customer support  and professional consulting 
we apply the provisions of asc  software revenue recognition and  if applicable  sab and asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware transactions where the software is not incidental 
when several elements  including software licenses  post contract customer support  and professional services  are sold to a customer through a single contract  the revenue from such multiple element arrangements are 
table of contents allocated to each element using the residual method in accordance with asc revenue is allocated to the support elements and professional service elements of an agreement using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value and to the software license portion of the agreements using the residual method 
we have established vsoe of the fair value of our professional services based on the rates charged to our customers in stand alone orders 
we have also established vsoe of fair value for post contract customer support based on substantive renewal rates 
accordingly  software license fees are recognized under the residual method for arrangements in which the software is licensed with maintenance and or professional services  and where the maintenance and professional services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software 
revenue allocated to software licenses is recognized when the following four basic criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
revenue allocated to post contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the support contract assuming the four basic criteria are met 
we also have subscription arrangements where the customer pays a fixed fee and receives services over a period of time 
we recognize revenue from the subscriptions ratably over the service period 
any up front setup fees associated with our subscription arrangements are recognized ratably  generally over one year 
any up front setup fees that are not associated with our subscription arrangements are recognized upon completion 
we previously followed the completed contract method for revenue recognition on long term contracts involving substantial customization 
during the quarter ended september   we established the ability to produce estimates sufficiently dependable to require adoption of the percentage of completion method with respect to certain fixed price contracts 
revenue on certain fixed price contracts where we provide information technology system development and implementation services is recognized over the contract term based on the percentage of development and implementation services that are provided during the period compared with the total estimated development and implementation services to be provided over the entire contract using guidance from asc  revenue recognition construction type and production type contracts 
these services require that we perform significant  extensive  and complex design  development  modification  or implementation activities of our customers systems 
performance will often extend over long periods  and our right to receive future payment depends on our future performance in accordance with these agreements 
the percentage of completion method involves recognizing probable and reasonably estimable revenue using the percentage of services completed  on a current cumulative cost to estimated total cost basis  using a reasonably consistent profit margin over the period 
due to the long term nature of these projects  developing the estimates of costs often requires significant judgment 
factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the projects include  but are not limited to  the availability of labor and labor productivity  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  and the impact of delayed performance 
if changes occur in delivery  productivity  or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenue  we revise our cost and revenue estimates  which may result in increases or decreases in revenue and costs  and such revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision become known 
we recognize losses on long term fixed price contracts in the period that the contractual loss becomes probable and estimable 
we record amounts invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met 
we record revenue that is earned and recognized in excess of amounts invoiced on fixed price contracts as trade receivables 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure that trade receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns of million  as of december  to ensure that we have established an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts  management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends 
table of contents and macroeconomic conditions  changes in customer payment terms  the length of time receivables are past due  and significant one time events 
we record specific reserves for individual accounts when we become aware of specific customer circumstances  such as bankruptcy filings  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  or potential unfavorable outcomes from disputes with customers or vendors 
our fiery products  which constitute approximately of our revenue  are primarily sold to a limited number of oems 
we expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively small number of oem customers for a significant portion of our revenue  although the significance of that revenue is expected to decline in future periods as our revenue increases from inkjet and apps products 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our oem  third party distributor  reseller  and other customers and require collateral  such as letters of credit and bank guarantees  in certain circumstances 
the past due or delinquency status of a receivable is based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable 
the need to write off a receivable balance depends on the age  size  and a determination of collectability of the receivable 
we generally have experienced longer accounts receivable collection cycles in our inkjet and apps operating segments compared to our fiery operating segment as  historically  oem customers have paid on a more timely basis 
down payments are generally required from inkjet and apps customers as a means to ensure payment 
inventory reserves 
management estimates potential future inventory obsolescence and purchase commitments to evaluate the need for inventory reserves 
current economic trends  changes in customer demand  product design changes  product life and demand  and the acceptance of our products are analyzed to evaluate the adequacy of such reserves 
significant management judgment and estimates must be made in connection with establishing inventory allowances and reserves in any accounting period 
material differences may result in changes in the amount and timing of our net income loss for any period  if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our inventories were million  net of inventory reserves of million  as of december  warranty reserves 
our fiery controller and inkjet printer products are generally accompanied by a month warranty from date of shipment  which covers both parts and labor 
in accordance with asc  loss contingencies  an accrual is made when the warranty liability is estimable and probable based upon historical experience 
a provision for estimated future warranty work is recorded in cost of goods sold upon recognition of revenue and the resulting accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty estimates 
management must estimate potential inventory return rates and replacement or repair costs to evaluate the need for warranty reserves 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing warranty reserves in each reporting period 
material differences may result in changes in the amount and timing of our income for any period  if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
warranty reserves were million as of december  litigation accruals 
we accrue for estimated litigation costs  including potential regulatory fines  when the likelihood of incurrence of the related cost is probable and management has the ability to estimate such costs 
until both of these conditions are met  the related litigation costs are recorded as incurred 
the material assumptions used to estimate the required litigation accrual include communication with our external attorneys regarding the expected duration of the lawsuit  the potential outcome of the lawsuit  and the likelihood of settlement  our strategy regarding the lawsuit  deductible amounts under our insurance policies  and past experiences with similar lawsuits 
the outcome of any particular lawsuit cannot be predicted and our income could be materially impacted  either positively or negatively  if the outcome is different than expected 

table of contents restructuring reserves 
we have engaged  and may continue to engage  in restructuring actions  which require management to utilize significant estimates related to the timing and the expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  realizable values of assets made obsolete  lease cancellation  facility downsizing  and other exit costs 
if actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc  which requires stock based compensation expense to be recognized based on the fair value of such awards on the date of grant 
we amortize stock based compensation expense on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period  after assessing the probability of achieving the requisite performance criteria with respect to performance based awards 
stock based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche as though the award were  in substance  multiple awards 
we must use our judgment in determining and applying the assumptions needed for the valuation of stock options  rsus  restricted stock awards rsas  and issuance of common stock under our espp 
we apply a forfeiture rate to reflect what we believe will be our final expense related to stock based compensation 
our determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by various assumptions including volatility  expected term  and interest rates 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock over a preceding period commensurate with the expected term of the option 
the expected term is based upon management s consideration of the historical life of the options  the vesting period of the options granted  and the contractual period of the options granted 
the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
expected dividend yield was not considered in the option pricing formula since we do not pay dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future 
the amounts to be recorded as stock based compensation expense in the future are subject to change if our assumptions regarding the variables used in determining the fair value of the instruments and the forfeiture rates are revised 
in adopting asc  we elected to adopt the simplified method to establish our beginning balance for the additional paid in capital apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation 
tax shortfalls resulting from the tax effects of employee stock based compensation absorbed the remaining balance of the apic pool in accounting for income taxes 
we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate our actual current tax expense and temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery of these deferred tax assets is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we either establish or increase a valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required to determine our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have established a valuation allowance of million as of december  for foreign tax credits resulting from the acquisition of our proofing business  compensation deductions potentially limited by us internal revenue code irc m  and net operating losses resulting from the radius acquisition 
if actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance that could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
deferred tax assets  as of december  were million  net of valuation allowance 
in accordance with asc through  income taxes basic recognition threshold  we account for uncertainty in income taxes by recognizing a tax position only when it is more likely than not that the tax 
table of contents position  based on its technical merits  will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable tax authority 
the tax benefit to be recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the applicable tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
significant management judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions 
our gross unrecognized benefits are million as of december  our evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
if actual settlements differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to recognize additional tax benefits or charges that could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
as of december   we have permanently reinvested million of unremitted earnings 
should these earnings be remitted to the us  the tax on these earnings would be million 
valuation analyses of intangible assets and goodwill 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each year according to the provisions of asc  goodwill intangibles and other subsequent measurement 
a two step impairment test of goodwill is required 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is required to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit  excluding goodwill  from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss must be recorded equal to the difference 
based on the outcome of conditions existing during the fourth quarter of  we determined that a triggering event requiring an interim impairment analysis had occurred relating to the inkjet reporting unit 
the resulting impairment analysis resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of the goodwill valuation analysis was performed based on our respective reporting units fiery  inkjet  and apps which are consistent with our operating segments identified in note segment information  geographic data  and major customers of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we determined the fair value of the inkjet and apps reporting units as of december  by equally weighting the market and income approaches 
the fair value of the fiery reporting unit was determined based on the market approach 
under the market approach  we estimated fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings of comparable companies 
under the income approach  we measured fair value of the inkjet and apps reporting units based on a projected cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
to identify suitable comparable companies under the market approach  consideration was given to the financial condition and operating performance of the reporting unit being evaluated relative to companies operating in the same or similar businesses  potentially subject to corresponding economic  environmental  and political factors and considered to be reasonable investment alternatives 
consideration was given to the investment characteristics of the subject company relative to those of similar publicly traded companies ie  guideline companies 
guideline company stocks are actively traded 
in applying the public company market multiple method pcmmm  valuation multiples were derived from historical and projected operating data of guideline companies and applied to the appropriate operating data of our reporting units to arrive at an indication of fair value 
five  four  and seven suitable guideline companies were identified for the fiery  inkjet  and apps reporting units  respectively 
based on our valuation results  we have determined that the fair values of our reporting units exceed their carrying values 
fiery  inkjet  and apps fair values are   and million  respectively  which exceed carrying value by   and  respectively 

table of contents because the fair value of the fiery reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value as of december  as indicated by the market based valuation  management did not deem it necessary to further supplement the bases for this judgment 
while the fair value of the inkjet and apps reporting units exceeded their carrying values based on the market based valuation  management determined to further examine whether an impairment had occurred given the inkjet impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of and the relatively small excess of the fair value of the apps reporting unit over its carrying value 
we reviewed the factors that could trigger an impairment charge and completed an income based impairment analysis 
as part of this process  we engaged a third party valuation firm to aid management in its analysis 
all estimates  key assumptions  and forecasts were either provided by or reviewed by us 
while we chose to utilize a third party valuation firm  the impairment analysis and related valuations represent the conclusions of management and not the conclusions or statements of any third party 
solely for purposes of establishing inputs for the income approach to assess the fair value of the inkjet and apps reporting units  we made the following assumptions despite improved inkjet performance in  resulting from an improving economic climate in and new product introductions beginning in and continuing in  inkjet revenues remained below results 
apps revenue in exceeded revenue due to improved apps performance resulting from the radius acquisition and continued strong performance from the pace acquisition 
inkjet revenue will exceed revenue levels in achieving a normalized long term growth model between and long term industry growth past our discounted cash flow projections for the inkjet and apps reporting units were based on six year financial forecasts  which were based on annual financial forecasts developed internally by management for use in managing our business and through discussions with the independent valuation firm engaged by us 
the significant assumptions utilized in these six year forecasts included annual revenue growth rates ranging from to  which equates to compound annual growth rates of and for the inkjet and apps reporting units  respectively 
future cash flows were discounted to present value using a mid year convention and a discount rate of 
terminal values were calculated using the gordon growth methodology with a long term growth rate of 
the sum of the fair values of the fiery  inkjet  and apps reporting units was reconciled to our current market capitalization based on our stock price plus an estimated control premium 
significant assumptions used in determining fair values of the reporting units include the determination of appropriate market comparables  estimated multiples of revenue and ebitda that a willing buyer is likely to pay  estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay  gross profit  and operating expenses 
inkjet gross profit is assumed to increase as fixed production costs are absorbed by increasing inkjet volumes  while apps gross profit is assumed to remain consistent during the forecast horizon 
gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue over the six year forecast horizon are assumed to approximate percentages realized by the guideline companies 
to assess the reasonableness of the estimated control premium of  we examined the most similar transactions in relevant industries and determined the average premium indicated by the transactions deemed to be most similar to a hypothetical transaction involving our reporting units 
we examined the weighted average and median control premiums offered in these industries  industry specific control premiums  and specific transaction control premiums to conclude that our estimated control premium is reasonable 

table of contents we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the life of the asset may need to be revised 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  our market capitalization relative to net book value  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets  significant changes in the strategy for our overall business  and our assessment of growth and profitability in each reporting unit over the coming years 
given the uncertainty of the economic environment and the potential impact on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the ongoing economic downturn  or the period or strength of recovery  made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing at december  will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or gross profit rates are not achieved  we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods relating to any of our reporting units  whether in connection with the next annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of or prior to that  if any such change constitutes an interim triggering event 
it is not possible to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  including ipr d  and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
all acquisitions are included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in december  asc was issued  which retained the fundamental requirement that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations while revising the accounting treatment for the fair values of certain acquired assets  liabilities  and expenses 
see note the company and its significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of this recent accounting pronouncement and its impact on our accounting for business combinations 
the amendment to asc applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  management estimates fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include  but are not limited to future expected cash flows  acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop ipr d into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
the fair value of ipr d was expensed prior to the effective date of the amendment to asc there were no ipr d costs associated with acquisitions after the effective date of this amendment 
the amendment to asc requires that we estimate the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration based on the probability of the realization of the performance targets 
that estimate is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market  which asc refers to as level inputs  reflecting our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities 
the fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured at each reporting period  with any changes in the fair value recognized as a component of general and administrative expense 

table of contents other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions include severance costs and the costs to vacate or downsize facilities  including the future costs to operate and eventually abandon or relinquish duplicate facilities 
these costs are based on estimates made by management and are subject to refinement 
estimated costs may change as additional information becomes available regarding assets acquired and liabilities assumed and as management continues its assessment of the pre merger operations 
consistent with the amendments to asc  acquisition related costs of million were expensed during the year ended december  in connection with our acquisition of radius 
likewise  the amendments to asc also required that restructuring related expenses associated with our acquisition of radius be expensed as a component of restructuring and other 
on july   we purchased radius for approximately million  net of cash acquired  plus an additional future cash earnout  which is contingent on achieving certain performance targets 
as of december   approximately million had been earned against the earnout 
the million excess above the valuation at the acquisition date was expensed as a component of general and administrative expense in accordance with asc the potential undiscounted amount of all future contingent consideration cash payments that we could be required to make  beyond amounts currently accrued  is between and million as of december  we acquired radius to establish our presence in the packaging industry 
on december   we acquired the remaining interest in raster  a mid market  wide format graphics printer developer and manufacturer in a step acquisition for approximately million  to further expand our inkjet operating segment 
on july   we purchased pace for approximately million  net of cash acquired  plus an additional future cash earnout  which is contingent on achieving certain performance targets 
as of december   approximately million had been earned against the earnout 
the potential undiscounted amount of all future contingent consideration cash payments that we could be required to make  beyond amounts currently accrued  is between and million as of december  we acquired pace to further strengthen our apps operating segment 
the radius  pace  and raster acquisitions are discussed more fully in note acquisitions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our financial projections may ultimately prove to be inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
as a result  these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable  assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur  which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or other actual results 
therefore  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to establish the valuation for these acquired businesses will prove to be correct 
we typically engage a third party valuation firm to aid management in its analysis 
all estimates  key assumptions  and forecasts were either provided by or reviewed by us 
while we chose to utilize a third party valuation firm  the valuations represent the conclusions of management and not the conclusions or statements of any third party 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidating our international operations 
we have a number of foreign subsidiaries  which together account for approximately of our net revenue  approximately of our total assets and approximately of our total liabilities as of december  we typically quote and invoice our international customers in us dollars 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we must remeasure and translate balance sheet and income statement items into us dollars 
foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured from the transaction currency into the functional currency at current exchange rates  except for non monetary assets and capital accounts  which are remeasured at historical exchange rates 
revenue and expenses are remeasured at monthly exchange rates  which approximate average exchange rates in effect during each period 
gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income expense  net 
net gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions  including hedging gains and losses  are reported in other income expense  net  and were a gain loss of   and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 

table of contents for those subsidiaries that operate in a local currency functional environment  all assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using current exchange rates  revenue and expenses are translated using monthly exchange rates  which approximate the average exchange rates in effect during each period 
resulting translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income oci in stockholders equity 
the cumulative translation adjustment balance at december  was an unrealized gain of million 
based on our assessment of the salient economic indicators discussed in asc  foreign currency matters  we consider the us dollar to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries except for our german subsidiary  efi gmbh  for which we consider the euro to be the subsidiary s functional currency  our japanese subsidiary  electronics for imaging japan kk  for which we consider the japanese yen to be the subsidiary s functional currency  and our uk subsidiary  electrons for imaging united kingdom limited  for which we consider the british pound sterling to be the subsidiary s functional currency

table of contents on february   our board of directors approved a million stock repurchase program 
on february   we entered into an agreement to acquire privately held streamline for approximately million in cash  plus an additional future cash earn out contingent on achieving certain performance targets 
streamline is the provider of printstream pmis software focused on mailing and fulfillment services for the printing industry 
as of december   we have permanently reinvested million of unremitted earnings  which are not available to meet our operating and working capital requirements in based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash generated from operating activities will satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  stock repurchase requirements  commitments see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next twelve months 
we believe that the most strategic uses of our cash resources include acquisitions  strategic investments to gain access to new technologies  repurchases of shares of our common stock  and working capital 
at december   cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments available for sale totaled million 
despite the current economic environment  we believe that our liquidity position and capital resources continue to remain sufficient to meet our operating and working capital needs 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in of compares with net cash used for operating activities in of million and net cash provided by operating activities in of million 
net cash provided by operating activities in consists primarily of net income of million  non cash charges and credits of million  and net change in operating asset and liabilities of million 
non cash charges and credits consist primarily of million in depreciation and amortization  million of stock based compensation expense  provision for inventory obsolescence of million  and million of excess solvent inventories and related end of life purchases  partially offset by million of other non cash credits  charges  and provisions 
the net change in operating assets and liabilities of million consists primarily of increases in accounts receivable  inventories  and other current assets of   and million  respectively  decreases in net taxes payable of million  partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
accounts receivable our historical and primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers and the timing of payments to our vendors and service providers 
one measure of the effectiveness of our collection efforts is average days sales outstanding for accounts receivable dso 
dsos were days  days  and days at december    and  respectively 
we calculate dso by dividing net accounts receivable at the end of the quarter by revenue recognized during the quarter  multiplied by the total days in the quarter 
the significant improvement in dso in is due to effective collections  especially during the fourth quarter 
we expect dsos to vary from period to period because of changes in the mix of business between our direct and oem customers  and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
as the percentage of inkjet and apps related revenue increases  we expect dsos may trend higher 
our dsos related to the inkjet and apps operating segments are traditionally higher than those related to oem customers in our fiery operating segment as  historically  oem customers have paid on a more timely basis 
inventories our inventories are procured primarily in support of the inkjet and fiery operating segments 
our inventories decreased by million from million in to million in primarily due to the million provision for excess solvent inventories and related end of life purchases 

table of contents accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities  and net income taxes payable our operating cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable and by our accrual of liabilities

table of contents property and equipment our net property and equipment purchases totaled   and million in   and  respectively 
our property and equipment additions have been funded by cash from operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment necessary in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods are difficult to predict and are dependent on a number of factors including our hiring of employees  the rate of change in computer hardware software used in our business  our business outlook  and decisions to further invest or expand business sites 
during the first quarter of  we sold a portion of the foster city  california campus for million 
under the agreement  we sold the approximately  square foot building at velocity way  as well as approximately acres of related land and certain other assets related to the property 
net proceeds from the sale of building and land  net of direct transaction costs paid in  were million 
the cost of the land  building  improvements  and direct transaction costs were included in the determination of the million gain on sale of building and land 
investments during and  we purchased  net of sales and maturities  marketable securities of and million  respectively 
during  we received net proceeds from sale and maturities of our marketable securities of million  of which million was used to repay the convertible senior debenture holders 
we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale 
our investments are made with a policy of capital preservation and liquidity as primary objectives 
we may hold investments in corporate bonds and us government agency securities to maturity  however  we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive  or we have better uses for the cash 
because we invest primarily in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe the purchase  maturity  or sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
restricted investments we have restricted investments that are required to be maintained by the synthetic lease of our foster city office facility 
we are required to maintain cash in libor based interest bearing accounts  which fully collateralize our synthetic lease 
we had of restricted investments at december   which was accounted for as restricted investments within noncurrent assets 
financing activities the primary use of funds for financing activities in   and  was the use of   and million  respectively  of cash to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock  which included our million asr and million tender offer in  repurchase of stock options from certain employees in conjunction with our fair value stock option exchange  and the net settlement of rsus and rsas for employee common stock related tax liabilities 
see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters  and issuer purchases of equity securities for further discussion of our common stock repurchase programs 
historically  our recurring cash flows provided by financing activities have been from the receipt of cash from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options and for espp shares 
we received proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases of espp shares of   and million in   and  respectively 
while we may continue to receive proceeds from these plans in future 
table of contents periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and are contingent on a number of factors including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in the plans  and general market conditions 
we anticipate that cash provided from the exercise of stock options may decline over time as we shift to issuance of rsus  rather than stock options 
the synthetic lease agreement for our corporate headquarters provides a residual value guarantee 
under asc  guarantees  the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after december  must be recognized as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
we have determined that the guarantee has no material value as of december  on june   we exercised our option to redeem and paid in cash the outstanding balance of our convertible senior debentures  which totaled million 
the redemption price for the securities was of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest amounts to  but not including  the redemption date 
other commitments our fiery inventory consists primarily of raw and finished goods  memory subsystems  processors  and asics  which are sold to third party contract manufacturers responsible for manufacturing our products 
our inkjet inventories consist of raw and finished goods  print heads  frames  uv ink  and other components in support of our internal manufacturing operations and solvent ink  which is purchased from third party contract manufacturers responsible for manufacturing our solvent ink 
should we decide to purchase components and do our own manufacturing of fiery controllers or inkjet solvent ink  or should it become necessary for us to purchase and sell components other than the processors  asics  or memory subsystems to our contract manufacturers  inventory balances and potentially property and equipment would increase significantly  thereby reducing our available cash resources 
further  the inventories we carry could become obsolete  thereby negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations 
we are also reliant on several sole source suppliers for certain key components and could experience a further significant negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations if such supplies were reduced or not available 
we may be required to compensate our subcontract manufacturers for components purchased for orders subsequently cancelled by us 
we periodically review the potential liability and the adequacy of the related allowance 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if we were required to compensate our subcontract manufacturers in amounts in excess of the related allowance 
legal proceedings from time to time  we may be involved in a variety of claims  lawsuits  investigations  and proceedings relating to contractual disputes  securities law  intellectual property  employment matters  and other litigation matters relating to various claims that arise in the normal course of our business 
we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we assess our potential liability by analyzing our specific litigation and regulatory matters using available information 
we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with inside and outside counsel  which involves a subjective analysis of potential results and outcomes  assuming various combinations of appropriate litigation and settlement strategies 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and ranges of possible loss on the pending litigation matters  we are unable to predict with certainty the precise liability that could finally result from a range of possible unfavorable outcomes 
however  taking all of the above factors into account  we reserve an amount that we could reasonably expect to pay for the cases discussed 
our estimates could be incorrect  and we could pay more or less than our current accrual 
litigation can be costly  diverting management s attention and could  upon resolution  have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow

this amount is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets under the captions accrued and other liabilities and contingent liability 
the current fair value represents the first year earnout  which was earned based on realization of performance targets 
the long term fair value represents the present value of probability adjusted revenues related to the second year earnout of million 
excludes contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities and certain purchase orders as discussed below 
purchase obligations in the table above include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude purchase orders for raw materials and other goods and services that are cancelable without penalty 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are generally fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
the expected timing of payment for the obligations listed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on when the goods or services are received or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of million  the timing of which is uncertain 
see note income taxes of notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits 
off balance sheet financing synthetic lease arrangements as of december  we were a party to two synthetic leases the lease and the lease  together leases covering our foster city facilities located at and velocity way  foster city  california 
the leases provided a cost effective means of providing adequate office space for our corporate offices 
the leases 
table of contents included an option to purchase the facilities during or at the end of each lease term for the amount expended by the lessor to purchase the facilities 
the funds pledged under the leases million for the lease and million for the lease at december  were in libor based interest bearing accounts and restricted as to withdrawal at all times 
on january   we sold the  square foot velocity way building  along with approximately acres of land and certain other assets related to the property for million 
we retained ownership of the approximately  square foot building at velocity way that we currently occupy along with the related land 
we exercised our purchase option with respect to the lease in connection with the sale of the building and land and terminated the corresponding synthetic lease 
accordingly  the million of pledged funds were recognized in the determination of the gain on sale of building and land in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  we have guaranteed to the lessor a residual value associated with the building equal to of their funding of the lease 
under the financial covenants  we must maintain a minimum net worth and a minimum tangible net worth as of the end of each quarter 
there is an additional covenant regarding mergers 
we were in compliance with all such financial and merger related covenants as of december  we have assessed our exposure in relation to the first loss guarantee under the lease and have determined there is no deficiency to the guaranteed value at december  if there is a decline in value  we will record a loss associated with the residual value guarantee 
in conjunction with the lease  we have entered into a separate ground lease with the lessor for approximately years 
as of december   we were treated as the owner of this building for federal income tax purposes 
since we exercised our purchase option with respect to the lease  our maximum exposure under our remaining synthetic lease arrangement is million as of december  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  general credit  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation  liquidity  and interest rate risks  which may be exacerbated by the tightening of global credit markets and increase in economic uncertainty that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and continue to cause credit and liquidity issues 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we may enter into financial instrument contracts to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings and cash flows 
the counterparties to such contracts are major financial institutions 
during the fourth quarter of  we began hedging our operating expense exposure in indian rupees 
the notional amount of our indian rupee cash flow hedge was million at december  interest rate risk marketable securities we maintain an investment portfolio of short term investments of various holdings  types  and maturities 
these short term investments are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of oci 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 

table of contents the following table presents the hypothetical change in fair values in the financial instruments held by us at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique measures the change in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points over a twelve month time horizon in thousands valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of basis points no change in interest rates valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of basis points foreign currency exchange risk a large portion of our business is conducted in countries other than the us we are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates for the euro  british pound sterling  indian rupee  and japanese yen 
although the majority of our receivables are invoiced and collected in us dollars  we have exposure from non us dollar denominated sales primarily euro  british pound sterling  and japanese yen and operating expenses primarily euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  and indian rupee in foreign countries 
we can benefit from a weaker dollar and we can be adversely affected from a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a weakening of the us dollar  may adversely affect our consolidated operating expenses and operating income loss as expressed in us dollars 
during the fourth quarter of  we began hedging our operating expense exposure in indian rupees 
the notional amount of our indian rupee cash flow hedge was million at december  financial risk management the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposures are related to non us dollar denominated sales in europe  japan  and the uk and operating expenses in europe  india  japan  and the uk during the fourth quarter of  we began hedging our operating expense exposure in indian rupees 
as of december   we had not entered into hedges against any other currency exposures  but we may consider hedging against currency movements in other currencies  as well as adjusting the hedged portion of our indian rupee exposure in the future 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities  typically us treasury and government sponsored entity securities  corporate debt instruments  and asset backed instruments 
these short term investments are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of oci 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading
