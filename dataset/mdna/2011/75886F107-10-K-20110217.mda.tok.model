in  we recognized million of arcalyst net product sales 
arcalyst is a protein based product designed to bind the interleukin called il cytokine and prevent its interaction with cell surface receptors 
arcalyst is available for prescription in the united states for the treatment of caps  including fcas and mws in adults and children and older 
caps are a group of rare  inherited  auto inflammatory conditions characterized by life long  recurrent symptoms of rash  fever chills  joint pain  eye redness pain  and fatigue 
intermittent  disruptive exacerbations or flares can be triggered at any time by exposure to cooling temperatures  stress  exercise  or other unknown stimuli 
clinical programs vegf trap eye ophthalmologic diseases vegf trap eye is a specially purified and formulated form of vegf trap  which is being developed for use in intraocular applications 
we  together with our ex us collaborator bayer healthcare llc  are evaluating vegf trap eye in phase programs in patients with the neovascular form of age related macular degeneration wet amd  central retinal vein occlusion crvo  and choroidal neovascularisation cnv of the retina as a result of pathologic myopia 
we and bayer healthcare conducted a phase study of vegf trap eye in patients with diabetic macular edema dme and are discussing plans to initiate phase studies in dme 
wet amd  diabetic retinopathy which includes dme  and retinal vein occlusion are three of the leading causes of adult blindness in the developed world 
in these conditions  severe visual loss is caused by a combination of retinal edema and neovascular proliferation 
the phase trials in wet amd  known as view and view vegf trap investigation of efficacy and safety in wet age related macular degeneration  compared vegf trap eye and lucentis ranibizumab injection  a registered trademark of genentech  inc lucentis is an anti angiogenic agent approved for use and the current standard of care in wet amd 
view was conducted in north america and view was conducted in europe  asia pacific  japan  and latin america 
the view and view trials both evaluated vegf trap eye doses of milligrams mg and mg at dosing intervals of four weeks and mg at a dosing interval of eight weeks after three monthly loading doses  compared with lucentis dosed according to its us label  which specifies doses of mg administered every four weeks over the first year 
as needed dosing prn with both agents is being evaluated in the second year of the studies  although patients will be dosed no less frequently than every weeks 
the primary endpoint of these non inferiority studies was the proportion of patients treated with vegf trap eye who maintain visual acuity at the end of one year compared to patients dosed monthly with lucentis 
visual acuity is defined as the total number of letters read correctly on the early treatment diabetic retinopathy study etdrs chart  a standard research tool for measuring visual acuity 
maintenance of vision is defined as losing fewer than three lines equivalent to letters on the etdrs chart 
secondary endpoints included the mean change from baseline in visual acuity as measured by etdrs  the proportion of patients who gained at least letters of vision at week  and the amount of fluid under the retina 
we and bayer healthcare announced week results from the view and view studies in november in these studies  all regimens of vegf trap eye  including vegf trap eye dosed every two months  successfully met the primary endpoint of statistical non inferiority compared to lucentis dosed every month 
in the north american view study  of patients receiving vegf trap eye mg monthly  of patients receiving vegf trap eye mg monthly  and of patients receiving vegf trap eye mg every two months achieved maintenance of vision compared to of patients receiving lucentis mg dosed every month 
in the international view study  of patients receiving vegf trap eye mg monthly  of patients receiving vegf trap eye mg monthly  and of pa tients receiving vegf trap eye mg every two months achieved maintenance of vision compared to of patients receiving lucentis mg dosed every month 
a generally favorable safety profile was observed for both vegf trap eye and lucentis 
the incidence of ocular treatment emergent adverse events was balanced across all four treatment groups in both studies  with the most frequent events associated with the injection procedure  the underlying disease  and or the aging process 
the most frequent ocular adverse events were conjunctival hemorrhage  macular degeneration  eye pain  retinal hemorrhage  and vitreous floaters 
the most frequent serious non ocular adverse events were typical of those reported in this elderly population who receive intravitreal treatment for wet amd  the most frequently reported events were falls  pneumonia  myocardial infarction  atrial fibrillation  breast cancer  and acute coronary syndrome 
there were no notab le differences among the study arms 
based on these positive results  we plan to submit a biologics license application bla to the us food and drug administration fda in the first half of for marketing approval of vegf trap eye in wet amd in the us in addition  bayer healthcare intends to submit regulatory applications in the first half of for marketing approval of vegf trap eye in wet amd in europe 
vegf trap eye is also in phase development for the treatment of crvo  another cause of visual impairment 
we are leading the copernicus controlled phase evaluation of repeated intravitreal administration of vegf trap eye in central retinal vein occlusion utility and safety study  and bayer healthcare is leading the galileo general assessment limiting infiltration of exudates in central retinal vein occlusion with vegf trap eye study 
patients in both studies receive six monthly intravitreal injections of either vegf trap eye at a dose of mg or sham control injections 
the primary endpoint of both studies is improvement in visual acuity versus baseline after six months of treatment 
at the end of the initial six months  patients are dosed on a prn basis for another six months 
all patients are eligible for rescue laser treatment 
we and bayer healthcare announced in december that in the copernicus study  vegf trap eye met the primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in visual acuity at six months compared to sham injections 
in this trial  of patients receiving vegf trap eye gained at least letters of vision from baseline  compared to of patients receiving sham injections p 
patients receiving vegf trap eye on average gained letters of vision  compared to a mean loss of letters with sham injections p  a secondary endpoint 
in the copernicus study  vegf trap eye was generally well tolerated 
the most common adverse events were those typically associated with intravitreal injections or the underlying disease 
serious ocular adverse events in the vegf trap eye group were uncommon and were more frequent in the control group 
the incidence of non ocular serious adverse events was generally well balanced between the treatment arms 
there were no deaths among the patients treated with vegf trap eye and two in the patients treated with sham injections 
galileo study data are expected in the first half of the phase dme study  known as da vinci dme and vegf trap eye investigation of clinical impact  was a double masked  randomized  controlled trial that evaluated four different dosing regimens of vegf trap eye versus focal laser treatment 
in february  we and bayer healthcare announced that treatment with vegf trap eye demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in visual acuity compared to focal laser therapy at weeks  the primary endpoint of the stud y 
visual acuity was measured by the mean number of letters gained 
patients in each of the four dosing groups receiving vegf trap eye achieved statistically significantly greater mean improvements in visual acuity to letters of vision gained compared to patients receiving focal laser therapy letters gained at week p for each vegf trap eye group versus focal laser 
vegf trap eye was generally well tolerated  and no ocular or non ocular drug related serious adverse events were reported 
the adverse events reported were those typically associated with intravitreal injections or the underlying disease 
in december  we and bayer healthcare reported that the mean visual acuity gains seen in the da vinci study at weeks were maintained or numerically improved up to completion of the study at week in all vegf trap eye study groups  including the group receiving a mg dose every two months 
at week  all vegf trap eye dose groups reported mean gains in visual acuity of to letters  compared to a mean loss of letters for patients receiving focal laser therapy p for each vegf trap eye dose group versus focal laser 
vegf trap eye was generally well tolerated during the study and no patients experienced ocular drug related serious adverse events 
there were no patients with non ocular serious adverse events judged by investigators to be drug related during the first six months of the study and one in the second six months 
the most common adverse events reported were those typically associated with intravitreal injections or the underlying disease 
the most frequent ocular adverse events reported among patients receiving vegf trap eye were conjunctival hemorrhage  eye pain  ocular redness hyperemia  and increased intraocular pressure 
the incidence of non ocular serious adverse events was generally well balanced between all treatment arms 
there were six deaths among the patients treated with vegf trap eye and one in the patients treated with focal laser over months 
based on these positive results  regeneron and bayer healthcare are discussing plans to initiate phase studies of vegf trap eye in dme 
in january  we and bayer healthcare initiated a new phase clinical trial in asia in collaboration with the singapore eye research institute seri investigating the efficacy and safety of vegf trap eye in patients with cnv of the retina as a result of pathologic myopia 
the study  which will enroll approximately patients  has started in japan and is scheduled to run until june collaboration with bayer healthcare in october  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with bayer healthcare for the global development and commercialization outside the united states of vegf trap eye 
under the agreement  we and bayer healthcare collaborate on  and share the costs of  the development of vegf trap eye through an integrated global plan 
bayer healthcare will market vegf trap eye outside the united states  where the companies will share equally in profits from any future sales of vegf trap eye 
if vegf trap eye is granted marketing authorization in a major market country outside the united states  we will be obligated to reimburse bayer healthcare for of the development costs that it has incurred under the agreement from our share of the collaboration profits 
within the united states  we retain exclusive commercialization rights to vegf trap eye and are entitled to all profits from any such sales 
we have received million in development milestone payments and can earn up to million in future milestone payments related to marketing approvals of vegf trap eye in major market countries outside the united states 
we can also earn up to million in sales milestone payments if total annual sales of vegf trap eye outside the united states achieve certain specified levels starting at million 
arcalyst inflammatory diseases arcalyst is being developed for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy 
gout  a disease in which il may play an important role in pain and inflammation  is a very painful and common form of arthritis that results from high levels of uric acid  a bodily waste product normally excreted by the kidneys 
the elevated uric acid can lead to formation of urate crystals in the joints of the toes  ankles  knees  wrists  fingers  and elbows 
uric acid lowering therapy  most commonly allopurinol  is prescribed to eliminate the urate crystals and prevent them from reforming 
paradoxically  the initiation of uric acid lowering therapy often triggers an increase in the frequency of gout attacks in the first several months of treatment  which may lead to discon tinuation of therapy 
the break up of the urate crystals can result in stimulation of inflammatory mediators  including il  resulting in acute flares of joint pain and inflammation 
these painful flares generally persist for at least five days 
we are conducting a phase clinical development program with arcalyst in gout patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy 
the program currently consists of pre surge prevention study against urate lowering drug induced gout exacerbations  pre surge  and re surge review of safety uti lizing rilonacept in gout exacerbations  each of which are described below 
in june  we announced that results from pre surge  a north america based double blind  placebo controlled study  showed that arcalyst prevented gout attacks  as measured by the primary study endpoint of the number of gout flares per patient over the week treatment period 
patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy who received arcalyst at a weekly  self administered  subcutaneous dose of mg had an decrease in mean number of gout flares compared to the placebo group over the week treatment period flares vs 
flares  p 
patients who received arcalyst at a weekly dose of mg had a decrease compared to the placebo group flares vs 
flares  p 
all secondary endpoints of the study were highly positive p vs 
placebo 
among these endpoints  treatment with arcalyst reduced the proportion of patients who experienced two or more flares during the study period by up to with arcalyst mg  with arcalyst mg  and with placebo  p 
in addition  treatment with arcalyst reduced the proportion of patients who experienced at least one gout flare during the study period by up to with arcalyst mg  with arcalyst  mg  and with placebo  p 
a total of patients were randomized in pre surge arcalyst was generally well tolerated with no reported drug related serious adverse events 
adverse events that occurred at a frequency of at least in any study group were injection site reaction with arcalyst mg  with arcalyst mg  and with placebo  upper respiratory tract infection with arcalyst mg  with arcalyst mg  and with placebo  lower respiratory tract infection with arcalyst mg  with arcalyst mg  and with placebo  musculoskeletal pain discomfort with arcalyst mg  with arcalyst mg  and with placebo  and headache  with arcalyst mg  with arcalyst mg  and with placebo 
in addition  in june  we reported results from a placebo controlled  phase study evaluating pain in patients presenting with an acute gout flare 
the results of this study showed that there was no significant benefit from combining arcalyst with indomethacin a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid considered the standard of care  as measured by the primary study endpoint  which was the average intensity of gout pain from to hours after initiation of treatment 
there are two ongoing studies in the phase program with arcalyst in the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy 
the global pre surge study  which has a similar trial design as pre surge  is evaluating the number of gout flares per patient over the first weeks of initiation of allopurinol therapy 
the global re surge study is evaluating the safety of arcalyst versus placebo over weeks in patients who are at risk for gout flares because they are taking uric acid lowering drug treatment 
pre surge and re surge are fully enrolled  and we expect to have initial data from both studies during the first quarter of we own worldwide rights to arcalyst 
aflibercept oncology aflibercept is a protein based product candidate designed to bind all forms of vascular endothelial growth factor a called vegf a  vegf b  and the related placental growth factor called plgf  and prevent their interaction with cell surface receptors 
vegf a and to a lesser degree  plgf is required for the growth of new blood vessels a process known as angiogenesis that are needed for tumors to grow 
aflibercept is being developed globally in cancer indications in collaboration with sanofi aventis 
we and sanofi aventis are conducting three randomized  double blind phase trials  all of which are fully enrolled  that are evaluating combinations of standard chemotherapy regimens with either aflibercept or placebo for the treatment of cancer 
one trial velour is evaluating aflibercept as a nd line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with folfiri folinic acid 
leucovorin  fluorouracil  and irinotecan 
a second trial vital is evaluating aflibercept as a nd line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer in combination with docetaxel 
a third trial venice is evaluating aflibercept as a st line treatment for hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer in combination with docetaxel prednisone 
in addition  a phase study affirm of aflibercept in st line metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with folfox folinic acid 
leucovorin  fluorouracil  and oxaliplatin is also fully enrolled 
each of the phase studies is monitored by an independent data monitoring committee idmc  a body of independent clinical and statistical experts 
the idmcs meet periodically to evaluate data from the studies and may recommend changes in study design or study discontinuation 
both interim and final analyses will be conducted when a pre specified number of events have occurred in each trial 
in september  we and sanofi aventis announced that  following a planned interim analysis  the velour study s idmc recommended that the velour study continue to completion as planned  with no modifications due to efficacy or safety concerns 
both sanofi aventis and our management and staff remain blinded to the interim study results 
final results from the vital and velour studies are anticipated in the first half of based on projected event rates  an interim analysis of the venice study is expected to be co nducted by an idmc in mid  with final results anticipated in initial data from the affirm study are anticipated in the second half of aflibercept collaboration with sanofi aventis we and sanofi aventis globally collaborate on the development and commercialization of aflibercept 
under the terms of our september collaboration agreement  as amended  we and sanofi aventis will share co promotion rights and profits on sales  if any  of aflibercept outside of japan for disease indications included in our collaboration 
in japan  we are entitled to a royalty of approximately on annual sales of aflibercept  subject to certain potential adjustments 
we may also receive up to million in milestone payments upon receipt of specified marketing approvals  including up to million related to the receipt of marketing approvals for up to eight aflibercept oncology and other indications in the united states or the european union and up to million related to the receipt of marketing approvals for up to five oncology indication s in japan 
under the aflibercept collaboration agreement  as amended  agreed upon worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement will be funded by sanofi aventis 
if the collaboration becomes profitable  we will be obligated to reimburse sanofi aventis for of aflibercept development expenses in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development expenses and our share of the collaboration profits and japan royalties  or at a faster rate at our option 
regn pcsk antibody for ldl cholesterol reduction elevated ldl cholesterol bad cholesterol level is a validated risk factor leading to cardiovascular disease 
statins are a class of drugs that lower ldl cholesterol by upregulating the expression of the ldl receptor ldlr  which removes ldl from circulation 
pcsk is a naturally occurring secreted protein that also modulates ldl cholesterol levels through its interaction with the ldl receptor 
in a landmark study published in the new england journal of medicine in march  patients with lower than normal pcsk levels due to a genetic abnormality not only had significantly lower levels of ldl cholesterol  but also a significant reduction in the risk of coronary he art disease 
we used our velocimmune technology to generate a fully human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of pcsk  called regn  that is intended to robustly lower ldl cholesterol 
in may  we announced that in an interim efficacy analysis of a dose escalating  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  phase trial in healthy volunteers  regn achieved substantial  dose dependent decreases of ldl cholesterol 
each dosing cohort consisted of six treated and two placebo patients 
in july  we presented additional data from this phase program 
at the highest intravenous dose tested  a single dose of regn achieved a greater than maximum mean reduction of ldl cholesterol from baseline that lasted for more than one month 
at the highest subcutaneous dose tested  a single dose of regn achieved a greater than maximum mean reduction of ldl cholesterol from baseline that lasted for more than two weeks 
no serious adverse events and no dose limiting toxicities have been reported 
dose escalation is ongoing in bo th studies 
in july  we also presented the results of an interim efficacy analysis of a dose escalating  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase trial of subcutaneously delivered regn in hyperlipidemic patients familial hypercholesterolemia and non familial hypercholesterolemia on stable doses of statins whose ldl levels were greater than milligrams per deciliter mg dl 
at the highest dose tested at that time  in eleven patients  a single dose of regn achieved an approximately maximum mean additional reduction of ldl cholesterol from baseline 
no serious adverse events and no dose limiting toxicities were reported 
dose escalation in this study is ongoing 
in early  we initiated phase studies of regn in patients with hypercholesterolemia 
regn is being developed in collaboration with sanofi aventis 
regn il r antibody for inflammatory diseases il is a key cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis  causing inflammation and joint destruction 
a therapeutic antibody to il r  actemra tocilizumab  a registered trademark of genentech  has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
regn is a fully human monoclonal antibody to il r generated using our velocimmune technology that has completed phase studies  the results of which were presented at the annual meetings of the european league against rheumatism eular in june and the american college of rheumatology in october regn was well tolerated by patients with rheumatoid arthritis  and no dose limiting toxicities were reported 
treatment with regn resulted in dose related reductions in biomarkers of inflammation 
regn is currently in a phase double blind  placebo controlled  dose ranging study in patients with activ e rheumatoid arthritis and a phase double blind  placebo controlled  dose ranging study in ankylosing spondylitis  a form of arthritis that primarily affects the spine 
both studies are enrolling patients  and initial phase results are expected in regn is being developed in collaboration with sanofi aventis 
regn il r antibody for allergic and immune conditions il r is required for signaling by the cytokines il and il both of these cytokines are critical mediators of immune response  which  in turn  drives the formation of immunoglobulin e ige antibodies and the development of allergic responses  as well as the atopic state that underlies asthma and atopic dermatitis 
regn is a fully human monoclonal antibody generated using our velocimmune technology that is designed to bind to il r 
a phase trial of regn in healthy volunteers has been completed 
a phase b study in patients with atopic dermatitis is underway and a phase study in asthma is planned 
regn is being developed in collaboration with sanofi aventis 
regn dll antibody for advanced malignancies in many clinical settings  positively or negatively regulating blood vessel growth could have important therapeutic benefits  as could the repair of damaged and leaky vessels 
vegf was the first growth factor shown to be specific for blood vessels  by virtue of having its receptor primarily expressed on blood vessel cells 
in the december  issue of the journal nature  we reported data from a preclinical study demonstrating that blocking an important cell signaling molecule  known as dll  inhibited the growth of experimental tumors by interfering with their ability to produce a functional blood supply 
the inhibition of tumor growth was seen in a variety of tumor types  incl uding those that were resistant to blockade of vegf  suggesting a novel anti angiogenesis therapeutic approach 
moreover  inhibition of tumor growth is enhanced by the combination of dll and vegf blockade in many preclinical tumor models 
regn is a fully human monoclonal antibody to dll generated using our velocimmune technology 
regn  which is being developed in collaboration with sanofi aventis  is in phase clinical development 
regn ang antibody for oncology in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a phase study in the oncology setting of regn  an antibody that specifically blocks ang the angiopoietins  which were discovered at regeneron  are ligands for the endothelial cell receptor tie and are essential for vascular development and angiogenesis 
unlike other family members  ang is strongly upregulated by endothelial cells at sites of angiogenesis and vascular remodeling  including tumors 
regn is being developed for cancer indications in collaboration with sanofi aventis 
regn ngf antibody for pain regn is a fully human monoclonal antibody to ngf  generated using our velocimmune technology  which is designed to block pain sensitization in neurons 
preclinical experiments indicate that regn specifically binds to and blocks ngf activity and does not bind to or block cell signaling for closely related neurotrophins such as nt  nt  or bdnf 
regn is being developed in collaboration with sanofi aventis 
in may  we announced an interim analysis of a randomized  double blind  four arm  placebo controlled phase trial in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee 
in july  we presented additional results from this trial through weeks 
the primary endpoint of this study was safety  and regn was generally well tolerated through weeks 
serious treatment emergent adverse events were rare and balanced between placebo and drug arms with three events in the placebo group and four events in the combined regn groups 
the most frequent adverse events reported among patients receiving regn included sensory abnormalities  arthralgias  hyper hypo reflexia  peripheral edema  and injection site reactions 
the types and frequencies of adverse events reported were similar to those previously reported from other investigational studies involving an anti ngf antibody 
in the first interim efficacy analysis  regn demonstrated significant improvements at the two highest doses tested as compared to placebo in average walking pain scores over weeks following a single intravenous infusion p 
in july  we reported that regn demonstrated significant improvements at the two highest doses tested as compared to placebo in average walking pain scores over weeks following a second intravenous infusion at week p 
pain was measured by the numeric rating scale nrs  as well as the western ontario and mcmaster osteoarthritis index womac pain and function subscales 
analysis of efficacy data from a phase trial in the acute setting of nerve root compression induced pain acute sciatica suggested that regn therapy would not be effective in that setting 
studies in burn pain  vertebral compression fracture  and pancreatitis pain have been terminated due to low enrollment 
in december  the company was informed by the fda that a case confirmed as avascular necrosis of a joint was seen in another company s anti ngf program 
the fda believes this case  which follows previously reported cases of joint replacements in patients on an anti ngf drug candidate being developed by another pharmaceutical company  provides evidence to suggest a class effect and has placed regn on clinical hold 
there are currently no ongoing trials with regn that are either enrolling or treating patients 
regn is being developed in collaboration with sanofi aventis 
regn and regn in the fourth quarter of  clinical trials began with two additional antibodies that are part of the sanofi aventis collaboration  regn and regn the targets of these antibodies have not been disclosed 
research and development technologies many proteins that are either on the surface of or secreted by cells play important roles in biology and disease 
one way that a cell communicates with other cells is by releasing specific signaling proteins  either locally or into the bloodstream 
these proteins have distinct functions  and are classified into different families of molecules  such as peptide hormones  growth factors  and cytokines 
all of these secreted or signaling proteins travel to and are recognized by another set of proteins  called receptors  which reside on the surface of responding cells 
these secreted proteins impact many critical cellular and biological processes  causing diverse effects ranging from the regulation of growth of particular cell types  to inflammation mediated by white blood cells 
secreted proteins can at times be overactive and t hus result in a variety of diseases 
in these disease settings  blocking the action of specific secreted proteins can have clinical benefit 
in other cases  proteins on the cell surface can mediate the interaction between cells  such as the processes that give rise to inflammation and autoimmunity 
our scientists have developed two different technologies to design protein therapeutics to block the action of specific cell surface or secreted proteins 
the first technology  termed the trap technology  was used to generate our first approved product  arcalyst  as well as aflibercept and vegf trap eye  all of which are in phase clinical trials 
these novel traps are composed of fusions between two distinct receptor components and the constant region of an antibody molecule called the fc region  resulting in high affinity product candidates 
velocisuitetm is our second technology platform  it is used for discovering  developing  and producing fully human monoclonal antibodies that can address both secreted and cell surface targets 
velocisuitetm velocisuitetm consists of velocimmune  velocigene  velocimouse  and velocimab the velocimmune mouse platform is utilized to produce fully human monoclonal antibodies 
velocimmune was generated by exploiting our velocigene technology see below  in a process in which six megabases of mouse immune gene loci were replaced  or humanized  with corresponding human immune gene loci 
velocimmune mice can be used to generate efficiently fully human monoclonal antibodies to targets of therapeutic interest 
velocimmune and our entire velocisuitetm offer the potential to increase the speed and efficiency through which human monoclonal antibody therapeutics may be discovered and validated  thereby improving the overall efficiency of our early stage drug development activities 
we are utilizing the velocimmune technology to produce our next generation of drug candidates for preclinical and clinical development 
our velocigene platform allows custom and precise manipulation of very large sequences of dna to produce highly customized alterations of a specified target gene  or genes  and accelerates the production of knock out and transgenic expression models without using either positive negative selection or isogenic dna 
in producing knockout models  a color or fluorescent marker may be substituted in place of the actual gene sequence  allowing for high resolution visualization of precisely where the gene is active in the body during normal body functioning as well as in disease processes 
for the optimization of preclinical development and pharmacology programs  velocigene offers the opportunity to humanize targets by replacing the mouse gene with the human homolog 
thus  velocigene allows scientists to rapidly identify the physical and biological effects of deleting or over expressing the target gene  as well as to characterize and test potential therapeutic molecules 
our velocimouse technology platform allows for the direct and immediate generation of genetically altered mice from embryonic stem cells es cells  thereby avoiding the lengthy process involved in generating and breeding knockout mice from chimeras 
mice generated through this method are normal and healthy and exhibit a germ line transmission 
furthermore  mice developed using our velocimo use technology are suitable for direct phenotyping or other studies 
we have also developed our velocimab platform for the rapid screening of antibodies and rapid generation of expression cell lines for our traps and our velocimmune human monoclonal antibodies 
antibody collaboration and license agreements sanofi aventis

while our royalties under this agreement could be significant if canakinumab is approved and successfully commercialized for additional disease indications  to date these royalties have been minimal 
accordingly  we are unable to predict whether these royalties will ever contribute materially to our results of operations or financial condition 
national institutes of health grant in september  we were awarded a five year grant from the national institutes of health nih as part of the nih s knockout mouse project 
the goal of the knockout mouse project is to build a comprehensive and broadly available resource of knockout mice to accelerate the understanding of gene function and human diseases 
under the nih grant  as amended  we have received million from the grant s inception through december  and are entitled to receive an additional million through the remaining term of the grant 
research programs our preclinical research programs are in the areas of oncology and angiogenesis  ophthalmology  metabolic and related diseases  muscle diseases and disorders  inflammation and immune diseases  bone and cartilage  pain  cardiovascular diseases  and infectious diseases 
sales and marketing we have established a small commercial organization to support sales of arcalyst for the treatment of caps in the united states 
we have no sales or distribution personnel and distribute the product through third party service providers 
we currently have no sales  marketing  commercial  or distribution organization outside the united states 
we are currently expanding our commercial capabilities and increasing the number of commercial personnel in preparation for the potential commercialization of vegf trap eye and our other late stage product candidates 
manufacturing our manufacturing facilities are located in rensselaer  new york and consist of three buildings totaling approximately  square feet of research  manufacturing  office  and warehouse space 
we currently have approximately  liters of cell culture capacity at these facilities 
at december   we employed people at our rensselaer facilities 
there were no impairment losses associated with long lived assets at these facilities as of december  among the conditions for regulatory marketing approval of a medicine is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to the good manufacturing practice gmp regulations of the health authority 
in complying with standards set forth in these regulations  manufacturers must continue to expend time  money  and effort in the areas of production and quality control to ensure full technical compliance 
manufacturing establishments  both foreign and domestic  are also subject to inspections by or under the authority of the fda and by other national  federal  state  and local agencies 
if our manufacturing facilities fail to comply with fda and other regulatory requirements  we will be required to suspend manufacturing 
this would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow 
competition we face substantial competition from pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and chemical companies see item a 
risk factors risks related to commercialization of products even if our product candidates are approved for marketing  their commercial success is highly uncertain because our competitors have received approval for and may be marketing products with a similar mechanism of action  or may enter the marketplace with better or lower cost drugs 
our competitors include genentech roche  novartis  pfizer inc  bayer healthcare  onyx pharmaceuticals  inc  eli lilly and company  abbott laboratories  sanofi aventis  merck co  inc  amgen inc  astraz eneca  bristolmyerssquibb  johnson and johnson  glaxosmithkline  and others 
many of our competitors have substantially greater research  preclinical  and clinical product development and manufacturing capabilities  and financial  marketing  and human resources than we do 
competition from smaller competitors may also be or become more significant if those competitors acquire or discover patentable inventions  form collaborative arrangements  or merge with large pharmaceutical companies 
even if we are able to commercialize additional product candidates  one or more of our competitors may have brought a competitive product to market earlier than us or may have obtained or obtain patent protection that dominates or adversely affects our activities or products 
our ability to compete will depend  to a great extent  on how fast we can develop safe and effective product candidates  complete clinical testing and approval processes  and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market 
competition among product candidates approved for sale will also be based on efficacy  safety  reliability  availability  price  patent position  and other factors 
arcalyst 
in  novartis received regulatory approval in the us and europe for canakinumab  a fully human anti interleukin il antibody  for the treatment of caps 
in january  novartis announced that it had submitted an application to the ema for approval of canakinumab in gout 
novartis has also announced that it plans to submit to the fda in the first quarter of an application for approval of canakinumab in gout 
canakinumab is also in development for atherosclerosis and a number of other inflammatory diseases 
in addition  there are both small molecules and antibodies in development by other third parties that are designed to block the synthesis of il or inhibit the signaling of il for example  xoma ltd  in collaboration with servier  is developing an antibody to il  and both amgen and medimmune are developing antibodies to the il receptor 
these drug candidates could offer competitive advantages over arcalyst 
the successful development and or commercialization of these competing molecules could adversely affect sales of arcalyst for caps and delay or impair our ability to commercialize arcalyst for indications other than caps 
vegf trap eye 
the market for eye disease products is also very competitive 
novartis and genentech are collaborating on the commercialization and further development of a vegf antibody fragment lucentis for the treatment of wet amd  dme  and other eye indications 
lucentis was approved by the fda in june for the treatment of wet amd and in june for the treatment of macular edema following retinal vein occlusion rvo 
lucentis was approved by the european medicines agency ema for wet amd in january and for the treatment of dme in january many other companies are working on the development of product candidates for the potential treatment of wet amd and dme including those that act by blocking vegf and vegf receptors as well as use of small interfering ribonucleic acids sirnas that modulate gene expression 
in addition  ophthalmologists are using off label  with success for the treatment of wet amd  dme  and rvo  a third party repackaged version of genentech s approved vegf antagonist  avastin bevacizumab 
the relatively low cost of therapy with avastin in patients with wet amd presents a significant competitive challenge in this indication 
the national eye institute nei initiated a phase trial to compare lucentis to avastin in the treat ment of wet amd 
data from this nei study are expected to be published in avastin is also being evaluated in eye diseases in trials that have been initiated in the united kingdom  canada  brazil  mexico  germany  israel  and other areas 
aflibercept 
many companies are developing therapeutic molecules designed to block the actions of vegf specifically and angiogenesis in general 
a variety of approaches have been employed  including antibodies to vegf  antibodies to the vegf receptor  small molecule antagonists to the vegf receptor tyrosine kinase  and other anti angiogenesis strategies 
many of these alternative approaches may offer competitive advantages to aflibercept in efficacy  side effect profile  or method of delivery 
additionally  some of these molecules are either already approved for marketing or are at a more advanced stage of development than our product candidate 
in particular  genentech has an approved vegf antagonist  avastin  on the market for treating certain cancers and a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working to develop competing vegf antagonists  including novartis  amgen  imclone llc eli lilly  pfizer  astrazeneca  and glaxosmithkline 
many of these molecules are further along in development than aflibercept and may offer competitive advantages over our molecule 
pfizer  onyx together with its partner bayer healthcare  and glaxosmithkline are selling and marketing oral medications that target tumor cell growth and new vasculature formation that fuels the growth of tumors 
monoclonal antibodies 
our early stage clinical candidates in development are all fully human monoclonal antibodies which were generated using our velocimmune technology 
our antibody generation technologies and early stage clinical candidates face competition from many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies using various technologies 
numerous other companies are developing therapeutic antibody products 
companies such as pfizer  johnson johnson  astrazeneca  amgen  biogen idec  inc  novartis  genentech roche  bristol myers squib  abbott  and glaxosmithkline have generated therapeutic products that are currently in development or on the market that are derived from recombinant dna that comprise human antibody sequences 
as noted above  astrazeneca and astellas have licensed our velocimmune technology as part of their internal antibody development programs 
we are aware of several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies actively engaged in the research and development of antibody products against targets that are also the targets of our early stage product candidates 
for example  pfizer  johnson johnson  and abbott are developing antibody product candidates against ngf 
genentech roche is marketing an antibody against il r tocilizumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  and several other companies  including centocor ortho biotech  inc and bristol myers squibb  have antibodies against il in clinical development for this disease 
glaxosmithkline  in partnership with oncomed pharmaceuticals  inc  has a dll antibody in clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors 
aerovance has two formulations of a biologic directed against il in clinical development 
amgen previously had an antibody against il r in clinical development for the t reatment of asthma 
we believe that several companies  including amgen and pfizer  have development programs for antibodies against pcsk amgen  pfizer  and astrazeneca have development programs underway for antibodies against ang other areas 
many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are attempting to discover new therapeutics for indications in which we invest substantial time and resources 
in these and related areas  intellectual property rights have been sought and certain rights have been granted to competitors and potential competitors of ours  and we may be at a substantial competitive disadvantage in such areas as a result of  among other things  our lack of experience  trained personnel  and expertise 
a number of corporate and academic competitors are involved in the discovery and development of novel therapeutics that are the focus of other research or development programs we are now conducting 
these competitors include amgen and genentech  as well as many others 
many firms and entities are engaged in research and development in the areas of cytokines  interleukins  angiogenesis  and muscle conditions 
some of these competitors are currently conducting advanced preclinical and clinical research programs in these areas 
these and other competitors may have established substantial intellectual property and other competitive advantages 
if any of these or other competitors announces a successful clinical study involving a product that may be competitive with one of our product candidates or the grant of marketing approval by a regulatory agency for a competitive product  such developments may have an adverse effect on our operations or future prospects 
we also compete with academic institutions  governmental agencies  and other public or private research organizations  which conduct research  seek patent protection  and establish collaborative arrangements for the development and marketing of products that would provide royalties or other consideration for use of their technology 
these institutions are becoming more active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements to collect royalties or other consideration for use of the technology they have developed 
products developed in this manner may compete directly with products we develop 
we also compete with others in acquiring technology from these institutions  agencies  and organizations 
patents  trademarks  and trade secrets our success depends  in part  on our ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection  and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties see item a 
risk factors risks related to intellectual property we may be restricted in our development and or commercialization activities by  and could be subject to damage awards if we are found to have infringed  third party patents or other proprietary rights 
our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology  inventions  and improvements that we consider important to our business and operations 
as of december   we held an ownership interest in a total of approximately issued patents in the united states and approximately issued patents in foreign countries with respect to our products and technologies 
in addition  we hold an ownership interest in hundreds of patent applications in the united states and foreign countries 
our patent portfolio includes granted patents and pending patent applications covering our velocisuite technologies  including our velocimmune mouse platform which produces fully human monoclonal antibodies 
our issued patents covering these technologies generally expire between and however  we continue to file patent applications directed to improvements to these technology platforms 
our patent portfolio also includes issued patents and pending applications relating to our marketed product  arcalyst  and our product candidates in clinical development 
these patents cover the proteins and dna encoding the proteins  manufacturing patents  method of use patents  and pharmaceutical compositions  as well as various methods of using the products 
for each of arcalyst and our late stage product candidates  aflibercept and vegf trap eye  these patents generally expire between and however  the projected patent terms may be subject to extension based on potential patent term extensions in countries where such extensions are available 
we also are the nonexclusive licensee of a number of additional patents and patent applications 
in july we entered into an amended and restated non exclusive license agreement with cellectis sa pursuant to which we licensed certain patents and patent applications relating to a process for the specific replacement of a copy of a gene in the receiver genome by homologous recombination 
pursuant to this agreement  we agreed to pay cellectis a low  single digit royalty based on any future revenue received by us from any future licenses or sales of our velocigene or velocimmune products or services 
no royalties are payable to cellectis on any revenue from commercial sales of antibodies from our velocimmune technology  including antibodies developed under our collaboration with sanofi aventis 
we also have non exclusive license agreements with amgen and other organizations for patent rights related to arcalyst 
in exchange for these licenses  we pay a mid single digit royalty on net sales of arca lyst 
patent law relating to the patentability and scope of claims in the biotechnology field is evolving and our patent rights are subject to this additional uncertainty 
the degree of patent protection that will be afforded to our products in the united states and other important commercial markets is uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the patent offices  courts  and governments in these countries 
there is no certainty that our existing patents or others  if obtained  will provide us protection from competition or provide commercial benefit 
others may independently develop similar products or processes to those developed by us  duplicate any of our products or processes or  if patents are issued to us  design around any products and processes covered by our patents 
we expect to continue  when appropriate  to file product and process applications with respect to our inventions 
however  we may not file any such applications or  if filed  the patents may not be issued 
patents issued to or licensed by us may be infringed by the products or processes of others 
defense and enforcement of our intellectual property rights is expensive and time consuming  even if the outcome is favorable to us 
it is possible that patents issued or licensed to us will be successfully challenged  that a court may find that we are infringing validly issued patents of third parties  or that we may have to alter or discontinue the development of our products or pay licensing fees to take into account patent rights of third parties see item a 
risk factors risks related to intellectual property we may be restricted in our development  manufacturing  and or commercialization rights by  and could be subject to damage awards if we are found to have infringed  third party patents or other proprietary rights 
government regulation regulation by government authorities in the united states and foreign countries is a significant factor in the research  development  manufacture  and marketing of arcalyst and our product candidates see item a 
risk factors regulatory and litigation risks if we do not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates  we will not be able to market or sell them 
all of our product candidates will require regulatory approval before they can be commercialized 
in particular  human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical trials and other pre market app roval requirements by the fda and foreign authorities 
many aspects of the structure and substance of the fda and foreign pharmaceutical regulatory practices have been reformed during recent years  and continued reform is under consideration in a number of jurisdictions 
the ultimate outcome and impact of such reforms and potential reforms cannot be predicted 
the activities required before a product candidate may be marketed in the united states begin with preclinical tests 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate and its formulations 
the results of these studies must be submitted to the fda as part of an ind  which must be reviewed by the fda before proposed clinical testing can begin 
typically  clinical testing involves a three phase process 
in phase  trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to determine the early safety profile of the product candidate 
in phase  clinical trials are conducted with subjects afflicted with a specific disease or disorder to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary safety  tolerability  and efficacy of different potential doses of the product candidate 
in phase  large scale clinical trials are conducted with patients afflicted with the specific disease or disorder in order to provide enough data to understand the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate  as required by the fda 
the results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a biologic product candidate are then submitted to the fda in the form of a bla for evaluation to determine whether the product candidate may be approved for commercial sale 
in responding to a bla  the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information  or deny the application 
any approval required by the fda for any of our product candidates may not be obtained on a timely basis  or at all 
the designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that such a trial will be sufficient to satisfy the parameters of a particular phase  and a clinical trial may contain elements of more than one phase notwithstanding the designation of the trial as being of a particular phase 
the results of preclinical studies or early stage clinical trials may not predict long term safety or efficacy of our compounds when they are tested or used more broadly in humans 
approval of a product candidate by comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries is generally required prior to commencement of marketing of the product in those countries 
the approval procedure varies among countries and may involve additional testing  and the time required to obtain such approval may differ from that required for fda approval 
various federal  state  and foreign statutes and regulations also govern or influence the research  manufacture  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping  marketing  transport  and other aspects of pharmaceutical product candidates 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals and the compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us or our collaborators or licensees to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could adversely affect the manufacturing or marketing of our products and our ability to receive product or royalty revenue 
in addition to the foregoing  our present and future business will be subject to regulation under the united states atomic energy act  the clean air act  the clean water act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  the national environmental policy act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  national restrictions  and other current and potential future local  state  federal  and foreign regulations 
business segments we manage our business as one segment which includes all activities related to the discovery of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical conditions and the development and commercialization of these discoveries 
this segment also includes revenues and expenses related to i research and development activities conducted under our collaboration agreements with third parties and our grant from the nih  ii arcalyst product sales for the treatment of caps  iii licensing agreements to utilize our velocimmune technology  and iv t he supply of specified  ordered research materials using our velocigene technology platform 
employees as of december   we had  full time employees  of whom held a phd and or phd  or pharmd degree 
we believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced personnel in a highly competitive environment  however  competition for these personnel is intense 
none of our personnel are covered by collective bargaining agreements and our management considers its relations with our employees to be good

risk factors we operate in an environment that involves a number of significant risks and uncertainties 
we caution you to read the following risk factors  which have affected  and or in the future could affect  our business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
the risks described below include forward looking statements  and actual events and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
furthermore  additional risks and uncertainties are described under other captions in this report and should be considered by our investors 
risks related to our financial results and need for additional financing we have had a history of operating losses and we may never achieve profitability 
if we continue to incur operating losses  we may be unable to continue our operations 
from inception on january  through december   we had a cumulative loss of billion 
if we continue to incur operating losses and fail to become a profitable company  we may be unable to continue our operations 
in the absence of substantial revenue from the sale of products or other sources  the amount  timing  nature or source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we conduct our research and development activities 
we may need additional funding in the future  which may not be available to us  and which may force us to delay  reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts 
we will need to expend substantial resources for research and development  including costs associated with clinical testing of our product candidates  and to prepare for potential commercialization of our late stage product candidates and  if one or more of those product candidates receive s regulatory approval  to fund the launch of the product s 
we believe our existing capital resources  including the million net proceeds from our october public offering of common stock and the million up front payment we received in august pursuant to our amended velocimmune technology license agreement with astellas pharma inc  together with funding we are entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements  will enable us to meet operating needs through at least  however  one or more of our collaboration agreements may terminate  our projected revenue may decrease  or our expenses may increase and that would lead to our capital being consumed significantly before such time 
our expenses may increase for many reasons  including expenses in connection with the potential commercial launch of our products  expenses related to new clinical trials testing arcalyst or vegf trap eye  and expenses related to the potential requirement for us to fund of phase clinical trial costs for any of our antibody product candidates pursuant to the terms of our collaboration with sanofi aventis 
we may require additional financing in the future and we may not be able to raise such additional funds 
if we are able to obtain additional financing through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  such sales may be dilutive to our shareholders 
debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that would restrict our business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our shareholders 
in october  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s registering the sale  in one or more offerings  of an indeterminate amount of equity or debt securities  together or separately 
our october public offering of approximately million shares of common stock was completed under this shelf registration statement  however  there is no assurance that we will be able to complete any additional offerings of securities 
should we require and be unable to raise sufficient funds to complete the development of our product candidates and also to successfully commercialize our late stage product candidates if they obtain regulatory approval  we may face delay  reduction or elimination of our research and development or preclinical or clinical programs  and even if regulatory approval is obtained for such product candidates  they may never be successfully launched or become profitable  in which case our business  financial condition  or results of operations may be materially harmed 
the value of our investment portfolio  which includes cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  is influenced by varying economic and market conditions 
a decrease in the value of an asset in our investment portfolio or a default by the issuer may result in our inability to recover the principal we invested and or a recognition of a loss charged against income 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaled million including million of restricted cash and marketable securities and represented of our total assets 
we have invested our excess cash primarily in direct obligations of the us government and its agencies  other debt securities guaranteed by the us government  and money market funds that invest in us government securities 
we consider assets classified as marketable securities to be available for sale  as defined by fasb authoritative guidance 
marketable securities totaled million at december   are carried at fair value  and the unrealized gains and losses are included in other accumulated comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders equity 
if the decline in the value of a security in our investment portfolio is deemed to be other than temporary  we write down the security to its current fair value and recognize a loss which may be fully charged against income 
for example  we recognized other than temporary impairment charges related to certain marketable securities of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the current economic environment and the continued volatility of securities markets increase the risk that we may not recover the principal we invested and or there may be further declines in the market value of securities in our investment portfolio 
as a result  we may incur additional charges against income in future periods for other than temporary impairments or realized losses upon a security s sale or maturity  and such amounts may be material 
risks related to arcalyst and the development of our product candidates successful development of any of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
only a small minority of all research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs 
even if clinical trials demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of any of our product candidates for a specific disease and the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained  the commercial success of any of our product candidates will depend upon their acceptance by patients  the medical community  and third party payers and on our partners ability to successfully manufacture and commercialize our product candidates 
our product candidates are delivered either by intravenous infusion or by intravitreal or subcutaneous injections  which are generally less well received by patients than tablet or capsule delivery 
if our products are not successfully commercialized  we will not be able to recover the significant investment we have made in developing such products and our business would be sever ely harmed 
we are testing aflibercept  vegf trap eye  and arcalyst in a number of late stage clinical trials 
clinical trials may not demonstrate statistically sufficient effectiveness and safety to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for these product candidates 
in a number of instances  we have terminated the development of product candidates due to a lack of or only modest effectiveness 
aflibercept is in phase clinical trials in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of nd line metastatic colorectal cancer  st line androgen independent prostate cancer  and nd line metastatic non small cell lung cancer 
aflibercept may not demonstrate the required safety or efficacy to support an application for approval in any of these indications 
we do not have proof of concept data from early stage  double blind  controlled clinical trials that aflibercept will be safe or effective in any of these cancer settings 
in march  genentech  inc announced that a phase trial of its vegf antagonist  avastin  in combination with chemotherapy in men with prostate cancer  did not meet its primary endpoint 
this trial had a very similar design to our ongoing phase trial of aflibercept in prostate cancer 
we are testing vegf trap eye in phase trials for the treatment of wet amd and the treatment of crvo 
although we reported positive phase trial results with vegf trap eye in wet amd after one year of treatment  the trial will continue for an additional year and there is a risk that the results from the second year of the study could differ from the previously reported results  and such difference could delay or preclude regulatory approval 
we also reported positive results in the first of two phase trials in the treatment of crvo 
the trial is continuing and there is a risk that the final results could differ from the previously reported results  and such final results could delay or preclude regulatory approval 
there is also a risk that the results of the second phase trial in crvo may demonstrate different results  and such results could delay or preclude regulatory approval 
a number of other potential new drugs and biologics which showed promising results in initial clinical trials subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
arcalyst is in phase clinical trials for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering drug therapy 
although we reported positive phase data from one trial in patients with gout initiating uric acid lowering drug therapy  there is a risk that the results of the other ongoing trials of arcalyst in patients initiating uric acid lowering drug therapy will differ from the previously reported phase trial 
a number of potential new drugs and biologics which showed promising results in initial clinical trials subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
we are studying our antibody candidates in a wide variety of indications in early stage clinical trials 
many of these trials are exploratory studies designed to evaluate the safety profile of these compounds and to identify what diseases and uses  if any  are best suited for these product candidates 
these early stage product candidates may not demonstrate the requisite efficacy and or safety profile to support continued development for some or all of the indications that are being  or are planned to be  studied 
clinical trials required for our product candidates are expensive and time consuming  and their outcome is highly uncertain 
if any of our drug trials are delayed or yield unfavorable results  we will have to delay or may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates 
we must conduct extensive testing of our product candidates before we can obtain regulatory approval to market and sell them 
we need to conduct both preclinical animal testing and human clinical trials 
conducting these trials is a lengthy  time consuming  and expensive process 
these tests and trials may not achieve favorable results for many reasons  including  among others  failure of the product candidate to demonstrate safety or efficacy  the development of serious or life threatening adverse events or side effects caused by or connected with exposure to the product candidate  difficulty in enrolling and maintaining subjects in the clinical trial  lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate or comparator drug  and the failure of clinical investigators  trial monitors  contractors  consultants  or trial subjects to comply with the trial p lan  protocol  or applicable regulations related to gcps 
a clinical trial may fail because it did not include a sufficient number of patients to detect the endpoint being measured or reach statistical significance 
a clinical trial may also fail because the dose s of the investigational drug included in the trial were either too low or too high to determine the optimal effect of the investigational drug in the disease setting 
many of our clinical trials are conducted under the oversight of idmcs 
these independent oversight bodies are made up of external experts who review the progress of ongoing clinical trials  including available safety and efficacy data  and make recommendations concerning a trial s continuation  modification  or termination based on interim  unblinded data 
any of our ongoing clinical trials may be discontinued or amended in response to recommendations made by responsible idmcs based on their review of such interim trial results 
for example  in september  a phase trial that was evaluating aflibercept as a st line treatment for metastic pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine was discontinued at the recommendation of an idmc after a planned analysis of interim efficacy data determined that the trial would not meet its efficacy endpoint 
the recommended termination of any of our ongoing late stage clinical trials by an idmc could negatively impact the future development of our product candidate s  and our business may be materially harmed 
we will need to reevaluate any drug candidate that does not test favorably and either conduct new trials  which are expensive and time consuming  or abandon the drug development program 
even if we obtain positive results from preclinical or clinical trials  we may not achieve the same success in future trials 
many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry  including regeneron  have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials  even after promising results have been obtained in earlier trials 
the failure of clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for the desired indication s could harm the development of our product candidate s  and our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be materially harmed 
serious complications or side effects have occurred  and may continue to occur  in connection with the use of our approved product and in clinical trials of some of our product candidates which could cause our regulatory approval to be revoked or otherwise negatively affected or lead to delay or discontinuation of development of our product candidates which could severely harm our business 
during the conduct of clinical trials  patients report changes in their health  including illnesses  injuries  and discomforts  to their study doctor 
often  it is not possible to determine whether or not the drug candidate being studied caused these conditions 
various illnesses  injuries  and discomforts have been reported from time to time during clinical trials of our product candidates 
it is possible that as we test our drug candidates in larger  longer  and more extensive clinical programs  illnesses  injuries  and discomforts that were observed in earlier trials  as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in smaller previous trials  will be reported by patients 
many times  side effects are only detectable after investigational drugs are tested in large scale  phase clinical trials or  in some cases  after they are made available to patients after approval 
if additional clinical experience indicates that any of our product candidates has many side effects or causes serious or life threatening side effects  the development of the product candidate may fail or be delayed  which would severely harm our business 
aflibercept is being studied for the potential treatment of certain types of cancer and our vegf trap eye candidate is being studied in diseases of the eye 
there are many potential safety concerns associated with significant blockade of vegf  that may limit our ability to successfully develop aflibercept and vegf trap eye 
these serious and potentially life threatening risks  based on clinical and preclinical experience of vegf inhibitors  include bleeding  intestinal perforation  hypertension  proteinuria  congestive heart failure  heart attack  and stroke 
in addition  patients given infusions of any protein  including vegf trap delivered through intravenous administration  may develop severe hypersensitivity reactions or infusion reactions 
other vegf blockers have reported side effects that became evident only after large scale trials or after marketing approval when large numbers of patients were treated 
there are risks inherent in the intravitreal administration of drugs like vegf trap eye  which can cause injury to the eye and other complications 
these and other complications or side effects could harm the development of aflibercept for the treatment of cancer or vegf trap eye for the treatment of diseases of the eye 
we have tested arcalyst in only a small number of patients 
as more patients begin to use our product and as we test it in new disease settings  new risks and side effects associated with arcalyst may be discovered  and risks previously viewed as inconsequential could be determined to be significant 
like cytokine antagonists such as kineret anakinra  a registered trademark of biovitrum  enbrel etanercept  a registered trademark of amgen and pfizer  and remicade infliximab a registered trademark of centocor  arcaly st affects the immune defense system of the body by blocking some of its functions 
therefore  arcalyst may interfere with the body s ability to fight infections 
treatment with kineret  a medication that works through the inhibition of il  has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections  and serious  life threatening infections have been reported in patients taking arcalyst 
these or other complications or side effects could cause regulatory authorities to revoke approvals of arcalyst for the treatment of caps or deny the approval of arcalyst in gout or other disease settings 
alter natively  we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials  make changes in the labeling of our product  or limit or abandon our efforts to develop arcalyst in new disease settings 
any such side effects may also result in a reduction  or even the elimination  of sales of arcalyst in approved indications 
we are studying regn  a fully human monoclonal antibody to ngf  in a variety of pain indications  including osteoarthritis of the knee 
in december  the company was informed by the fda that a case confirmed as avascular necrosis of a joint was seen in another company s anti ngf program 
the fda believes this case  which follows previously reported cases of joint replacements in patients on an anti ngf drug candidate being developed by another pharmaceutical company  provides evidence to suggest a class effect and has placed regn on clinical hold 
there are currently no ongoing trials with regn that are either enrolling or treating patients 
arcalyst and our product candidates in development are recombinant proteins that could cause an immune response  resulting in the creation of harmful or neutralizing antibodies against the therapeutic protein 
in addition to the safety  efficacy  manufacturing  and regulatory hurdles faced by our product candidates  the administration of recombinant proteins frequently causes an immune response  resulting in the creation of antibodies against the therapeutic protein 
the antibodies can have no effect or can totally neutralize the effectiveness of the protein  or require that higher doses be used to obtain a therapeutic effect 
in some cases  the antibody can cross react with the patient s own proteins  resulting in an auto immune type disease 
whether antibodies will be created can often not be predicted from preclinical or clinical experiments  and their detection or appearance is often delayed  so that there can be no assurance that neutralizing antibodies will not be detected at a later date  in some cases even after pivotal clinical tri als have been completed 
antibodies directed against the receptor domains of arcalyst were detected in patients with caps after treatment with arcalyst 
nineteen of subjects who received arcalyst for at least weeks tested positive for treatment emerging binding antibodies on at least one occasion 
to date  no side effects related to antibodies were observed in these subjects and there were no observed effects on drug efficacy or drug levels 
it is possible that as we continue to test aflibercept and vegf trap eye with more sensitive assays in different patient populations and possibly larger clinical trials  we will find that subjects given aflibercept and vegf trap eye develop antibodies to these product candidates  and may also experience side effects related to the antibodies  which could adver sely impact the development of such candidates 
we may be unable to formulate or manufacture our product candidates in a way that is suitable for clinical or commercial use 
changes in product formulations and manufacturing processes may be required as product candidates progress in clinical development and are ultimately commercialized 
if we are unable to develop suitable product formulations or manufacturing processes to support large scale clinical testing of our product candidates  including our antibody candidates  we may be unable to supply necessary materials for our clinical trials  which would delay the development of our product candidates 
similarly  if we are unable to supply sufficient quantities of our product or develop product formulations suitable for commercial use  we will not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates 
risks related to intellectual property if we cannot protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets or our patents are insufficient to protect our proprietary rights  our business and competitive position will be harmed 
our business requires using sensitive and proprietary technology and other information that we protect as trade secrets 
we seek to prevent improper disclosure of these trade secrets through confidentiality agreements 
if our trade secrets are improperly exposed  either by our own employees or our collaborators  it would help our competitors and adversely affect our business 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
the patent position of biotechnology companies involves complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty 
our patents may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented 
patent applications filed outside the united states may be challenged by third parties who file an opposition 
such opposition proceedings are increasingly common in the european union and are costly to defend 
we have pending patent applications in the european patent office and it is likely that we will need to defend patent applications from third party challengers from time to time in the future 
our patent rights may not provide us with a proprietary position or competitive advantages against competitors 
furthermore  even if the outcome is favorable to us  the enforcement of our intellectual property rights can be extremely expensive and time consuming 
we may be restricted in our development  manufacturing  and or commercialization activities by  and could be subject to damage awards if we are found to have infringed  third party patents or other proprietary rights 
our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties 
other parties may allege that they have blocking patents to our products in clinical development  either because they claim to hold proprietary rights to the composition of a product or the way it is manufactured or used 
moreover  other parties may allege that they have blocking patents to antibody products made using our velocimmune technology  either because of the way the antibodies are discovered or produced or because of a proprietary position covering an ant ibody or the antibody s target 
we are aware of patents and pending applications owned by genentech that claim certain chimeric vegf receptors 
we do not believe that aflibercept or vegf trap eye infringes any valid claim in these patents or patent applications 
however  genentech could seek to initiate a lawsuit or present a counterclaim for patent infringement in the declaratory judgment action we have filed  and assert that its patents are valid and cover aflibercept or vegf trap eye or uses thereof 
genentech may be motivated to take such action s in an effort to impair our ability to develop and sell aflibercept or vegf trap eye  which represent potential competitive threats to genentech s vegf binding products and product candidates 
we commenced in november a lawsuit against genentech seeking a declaratory judgment that no activities relating to the regeneron ve gf trap infringe any valid claim of certain genentech patents 
it is possible that the court may decide to dismiss the action on procedural grounds or reach an adverse determination that would likely materially harm our business by requiring us to seek a license  which may not be available  or precluding the manufacture  further development  or sale of aflibercept or vegf trap eye  or resulting in a damage award 
similar patent actions may be taken in other countries  which could have similar or other adverse outcomes that would materially harm our business 
we are aware of patents and pending applications owned by roche that claim antibodies to il r and methods of treating rheumatoid arthritis with such antibodies 
we are developing regn  an antibody to il r  for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
although we do not believe that regn infringes any valid claim in these patents or patent applications  roche could initiate a lawsuit for patent infringement and assert its patents are valid and cover regn we are aware of a us patent jointly owned by genentech and city of hope relating to the production of recombinant antibodies in host cells 
we currently produce our antibody product candidates using recombinant antibodies from host cells and may choose to produce additional antibody product candidates in this manner 
neither arcalyst  aflibercept  nor vegf trap eye are recombinant antibodies 
if any of our antibody product candidates are produced in a manner subject to valid claims in the genentech patent  then we may need to obtain a license from genentech  should one be available 
genentech has licensed this patent to several different companies under confidential license agreements 
if we desire a license for any of our antibody product candidates and are unable to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms or at all  we may be restr icted in our ability to use genentech s techniques to make recombinant antibodies in or to import them into the united states 
further  we are aware of a number of other third party patent applications that  if granted with claims as currently drafted  may cover our current or planned activities 
we cannot assure you that our products and or actions in manufacturing and selling our product candidates will not infringe such patents 
any patent holders could sue us for damages and seek to prevent us from manufacturing  selling  or developing our drug candidates  and a court may find that we are infringing validly issued patents of third parties 
in the event that the manufacture  use  or sale of any of our clinical candidates infringes on the patents or violates other proprietary rights of third parties  we may be prevented from pursuing product development  manufacturing  and commercialization of our drugs and may be required to pay costly damages 
such a result may materially harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
legal disputes are likely to be costly and time consuming to defend 
we seek to obtain licenses to patents when  in our judgment  such licenses are needed 
if any licenses are required  we may not be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the failure to obtain any such license could prevent us from developing or commercializing any one or more of our product candidates  which could severely harm our business 
regulatory and litigation risks if we do not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates  we will not be able to market or sell them 
we cannot sell or market products without regulatory approval 
if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our product candidates  including arcalyst for the treatment of diseases other than caps or vegf trap eye for the treatment of ophthalmologic disease  the value of our company and our results of operations will be harmed 
in the united states  we must obtain and maintain approval from the fda for each drug we intend to sell 
obtaining fda approval is typically a lengthy and expensive process  and approval is highly uncertain 
foreign governments also regulate drugs distributed in their country and approval in any country is likely to be a lengthy and expensive process  and approval is highly uncertain 
except for the fda approval of arcalyst and ema approval of rilonacept for the treatment of caps  none of our product candidates has ever received regulatory approval to be marketed and sold in the united states or any other country 
we may never receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates 
the fda enforces good clinical practices gcps and other regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors  clinical research organizations cros  principal investigators  and trial sites 
if we or any of the third parties conducting our clinical studies are determined to have failed to fully comply with gcps  the study protocol or applicable regulations  the clinical data generated in our studies may be deemed unreliable 
this could result in non approval of our product candidates by the fda  or we or the fda may decide to conduct additional audits or require additional clinical studies  which would delay our development programs and substantially harm our business 
before approving a new drug or biologic product  the fda requires that the facilities at which the product will be manufactured be in compliance with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp requirements 
manufacturing product candidates in compliance with these regulatory requirements is complex  time consuming  and expensive 
to be successful  our products must be manufactured for development  following approval  in commercial quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements  and at competitive costs 
if we or any of our product collaborators or third party manufacturers  product packagers  or labelers are unable to maintain regulatory compliance  the fda can impose regulatory sanctions  including  among other things  refusal to approve a pending application for a new drug or biologic product  or revocation of a pre existing approval 
as a r esult  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be materially harmed 
in addition to the fda and other regulatory agency regulations in the united states  we are subject to a variety of foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials  manufacturing  marketing and approval of drugs  and commercial sale and distribution of drugs in foreign countries 
the foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with fda approval as well as country specific regulations 
whether or not we obtain fda approval for a product in the united states  we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of arcalyst or any of our product candidates in those countries 
if we fail to meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in the manufacture of our marketed product and clinical candidates  we could incur substantial remedial costs  delays in the development of our clinical candidates and or in their commercial launch if they obtain regulatory approval  and a reduction in sales 
we and our third party providers are required to maintain compliance with cgmp  and are subject to inspections by the fda or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance 
changes of suppliers or modifications of methods of manufacturing may require amending our application to the fda and acceptance of the change by the fda prior to release of product 
because we produce multiple product candidates at our facility in rensselaer  new york  there are increased risks associated with cgmp compliance 
our inability  or the inability of our third party service providers  to demonstrate ongoing cgmp compliance could require us to engage in lengthy and expensive remediation efforts  withdraw or recall product  halt or interrupt clinical trials  and or interrupt commercial supply of our marketed product 
any delay  interruption or other is sues that arise in the manufacture  fill finish  packaging  or storage of our marketed product and product candidates as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to pass any regulatory agency inspection or maintain cgmp compliance could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products 
any finding of non compliance could increase our costs  cause us to delay the development of our product candidates  and cause us to lose revenue from our marketed product 
if the testing or use of our products harms people  we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing  and sale of drugs for use in people expose us to product liability risk 
any informed consent or waivers obtained from people who sign up for our clinical trials may not protect us from liability or the cost of litigation 
we may be subject to claims by patients who use arcalyst that they have been injured by a side effect associated with the drug 
our product liability insurance may not cover all potential liabilities or may not completely cover any liability arising from any such litigation 
moreover  in the future we may not have access to liability insurance or be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms 
if we market and sell arcalyst in a way that violates federal or state fraud and abuse laws  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
in addition to fda and related regulatory requirements  we are subject to health care fraud and abuse laws  such as the federal false claims act  the anti kickback provisions of the federal social security act  and other state and federal laws and regulations 
federal and state anti kickback laws prohibit  among other things  payments or other remuneration to induce or reward someone to purchase  prescribe  endorse or recommend a product that is reimbursed under federal or state healthcare programs 
if we provide payments or other remuneration to a healthcare professional to induce the prescribing of our products  we could face liability under state and federal anti kickback laws 
federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false claim for payment to the federal government  or knowingly making  or causing to be made  a false statement to get a false claim paid 
pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities  such as allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product  reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates  engaging in promotion for uses that the fda has not approved  known as off label uses  that caused claims to be submitted to medicaid for non covered off label uses  and submitting inflated best price information to the medica id rebate program 
the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti kickback law and false claims laws  which apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs  or  in several states  apply regardless of the payer 
sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties  exclusion of a manufacturer s products from reimbursement under government programs  criminal fines  and imprisonment 
even if it is determined that we have not violated these laws  government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity  which would harm our business and financial results and condition 
because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors  it is possible that some of our business activities could be challenged under one or more of such laws 
in recent years  several states and localities  including california  the district of columbia  massachusetts  maine  minnesota  nevada  new mexico  vermont  and west virginia  have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs  and file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales  marketing  pricing  clinical trials  and other activities 
similar requirements are being considered in other states 
in addition  as part of the federal patient protection and affordable care act  or ppaca  pharmaceutical companies will be required to file reports with the federal government regarding payments made to healthcare professionals 
many of these requirements are new and uncertain  and the penalties for failure to comply with these requirements are unclear 
nonetheless  if we are f ound not to be in full compliance with these laws  we could face enforcement actions  fines  and other penalties  and could receive adverse publicity  which would harm our business and financial results and condition 
our operations may involve hazardous materials and are subject to environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations 
we may incur substantial liability arising from our activities involving the use of hazardous materials 
as a biopharmaceutical company with significant manufacturing operations  we are subject to extensive environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations  including those governing the use of hazardous materials 
our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of chemicals  viruses  radioactive compounds  and other hazardous materials 
the cost of compliance with environmental  health  and safety regulations is substantial 
if an accident involving these materials or an environmental discharge were to occur  we could be held liable for any resulting damages  or face regulatory actions  which could exceed our resources or insurance coverage 
our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance  public disclosure  and accounting requirements and regulations that could adversely affect our business and financial results and condition 
we are subject to changing rules and regulations of various federal and state governmental authorities as well as the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board pcaob  the sec and the nasdaq global market  have issued a significant number of new and increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional requirements and regulations in response to laws enacted by congress  including the sarbanes oxley act of and  most recently  the dodd frank wall street reform and protection act  or the dodd frank act 
there are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the dodd frank act that expressly authorized or required the sec to adopt additional rules in these areas  such as shareholder approval of executive compensation so called say on pay and proxy access 
on january   the sec adopted final rules concerning say on pay 
our efforts to comply with these requirements and regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  an increase in expenses and a diversion of management s time from other business activities 
in future years  if we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective  the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected 
as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on form k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
our independent registered public accounting firm provided us with an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december   which report is included in this annual report on form k 
however  we cannot assure you that management or our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to provide such an unqualified report as of future year ends 
in this event  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock 
in addition  if it is determined that deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls exist and that they are reasonably likely to adversely affect our ability to record  process  summarize  and report financial information  we would likely incur additio nal costs to remediate these deficiencies and the costs of such remediation could be material 
changes in laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business 
all aspects of our business  including research and development  manufacturing  marketing  pricing  sales  litigation  and intellectual property rights  are subject to extensive legislation and regulation 
changes in applicable federal and state laws and agency regulations could have a materially negative impact on our business 
these include changes in the fda and foreign regulatory processes for new therapeutics that may delay or prevent the approval of any of our current or future product candidates  new laws  regulations  or judicial decisions related to healthcare availability or the payment for healthcare products and services  including prescription drugs  that would make it more difficult for us to market and sell products once they are approved by the fda or foreign regulatory agencies  changes in fda and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring prior to or after the introduction of new products to market  which could materially increase our costs of doing business  and changes in fda and foreign cgmps that make it more difficult for us to manufacture our marketed product and clinical candidates in accordance with cgmps 
the ppaca potential regulations easing the entry of competing follow on biologics in the marketplace  new legislation or implementation of existing statutory provisions on importation of lower cost competing drugs from other jurisdictions  and legislation on comparative effectiveness research are examples of previously enacted and possible future changes in laws that could adversely affect our business 
risks related to our reliance on third parties if our antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis is terminated  our business operations and financial condition  and our ability to discover  develop  manufacture  and commercialize our pipeline of product candidates in the time expected  or at all  would be materially harmed 
we rely heavily on funding from sanofi aventis to support our target discovery and antibody research and development programs 
sanofi aventis has committed to pay up to billion between and to fund our efforts to identify and validate drug discovery targets and pre clinically develop fully human monoclonal antibodies against such targets 
in addition  sanofi aventis funds almost all of the development expenses incurred by both companies in connection with the clinical development of antibodies that sanofi aventis elects to co develop with us 
we rely on sanofi aventis to fund these activities 
in addition  with respect to those antibodies that sanofi aventis elects to co develop with us  such as regn  regn  regn  regn  regn  and regn  we rely on sanofi aventis to lead much of the clinical development efforts and assist wit h obtaining regulatory approval  particularly outside the united states 
we also rely on sanofi aventis to lead the commercialization efforts to support all of the antibody products that are co developed by sanofi aventis and us 
if sanofi aventis does not elect to co develop the antibodies that we discover or opts out of their development  we would be required to fund and oversee on our own the clinical trials  any regulatory responsibilities  and the ensuing commercialization efforts to support our antibody products 
if sanofi aventis terminates the antibody collaboration or fails to comply with its payment obligations thereunder  our business  financial condition  and results of operations would be materially harmed 
we would be required to either expend substantially more resources than we have anticipated to support our research and development efforts  which could require us to seek additional funding that might not be available on favorable terms or at all  or materially cut back on such activities 
while we cannot assure you that any of the antibodies from this collaboration will ever be successfully developed and commercialized  if sanofi aventis does not perform its obligations with respect to antibodies that it elects to co develop  our ability to develop  manufacture  and commercialize these antibody product candidates will be significantly adversely affected 
if our collaboration with sanofi aventis for aflibercept is terminated  or sanofi aventis materially breaches its obligations thereunder  our business operations and financial condition  and our ability to develop  manufacture  and commercialize aflibercept in the time expected  or at all  would be materially harmed 
we rely heavily on sanofi aventis to lead much of the development of aflibercept 
sanofi aventis funds all of the development expenses incurred by both companies in connection with the aflibercept program 
if the aflibercept program continues  we will rely on sanofi aventis to assist with funding the aflibercept program  provide commercial manufacturing capacity  enroll and monitor clinical trials  obtain regulatory approval  particularly outside the united states  and lead the commercialization of aflibercept 
while we cannot assure you that aflibercept will ever be successfully developed and commercialized  if sanofi aventis does not perform its obligations in a timely manner  or at all  our ability to develop  manufacture  and commercialize aflibercept in cancer indications will be significantly adversely affected 
sanofi aventis has the right to terminate its collaboration agreement with us at any time upon twelve months advance notice 
if sanofi aventis were to terminate its collaboration agreement with us  we would not have the resources or skills to replace those of our partner  which could require us to seek additional funding that might not be available on favorable terms or at all  and could cause significant delays in the development and or manufacture of aflibercept and result in substantial additional costs to us 
we have limited commercial capabilities and would have to develop or outsource these capabilities 
termination of the sanofi aventis collaboration agreement for aflibercept would create substantial new and additional risks to the successful development and commercialization of aflibercept 
if our collaboration with bayer healthcare for vegf trap eye is terminated  or bayer healthcare materially breaches its obligations thereunder  our business operations and financial condition  and our ability to develop and commercialize vegf trap eye in the time expected  or at all  would be materially harmed 
we rely heavily on bayer healthcare to assist with the development of vegf trap eye 
under our agreement with them  bayer healthcare is required to fund approximately half of the development expenses incurred by both companies in connection with the global vegf trap eye development program 
if the vegf trap eye program continues  we will rely on bayer healthcare to assist with funding the vegf trap eye development program  lead the development of vegf trap eye outside the united states  obtain regulatory approval outside the united states  and provide all sales  marketing  and commercial support for the product outside the united states 
in particular  bayer healthcare has responsibility for selling vegf trap eye outside the united states using its sales force 
while we cannot assure you that vegf trap eye will ever be successfully developed and commerci alized  if bayer healthcare does not perform its obligations in a timely manner  or at all  our ability to develop  manufacture  and commercialize vegf trap eye outside the united states will be significantly adversely affected 
bayer healthcare has the right to terminate its collaboration agreement with us at any time upon six or twelve months advance notice  depending on the circumstances giving rise to termination 
if bayer healthcare were to terminate its collaboration agreement with us  we would not have the resources or skills to replace those of our partner  which could require us to seek additional funding that might not be available on favorable terms or at all  and could cause significant delays in the development and or commercialization of vegf trap eye outside the united states and result in substantial additional costs to us 
we currently have limited commercial capabilities and would have to develop or outsource these capabilities outside the united states 
termination of the bayer healthcare collaboration agreement would create substantial new and additional risks to the successful development and commercialization of vegf trap eye 
our collaborators and service providers may fail to perform adequately in their efforts to support the development  manufacture  and commercialization of arcalyst and our drug candidates 
we depend upon third party collaborators  including sanofi aventis  bayer healthcare  and service providers such as cros  outside testing laboratories  clinical investigator sites  and third party manufacturers and product packagers and labelers  to assist us in the manufacture and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates 
if any of our existing collaborators or service providers breaches or terminates its agreement with us or does not perform its development or manufacturing services under an agreement in a timely manner or in compliance with applicable gmps  good laboratory practices glps  or gcp standards  we could experience additional costs  delays  and difficulties in the manufacture or development of  or in obtaining approval by regulatory authorities for our product candidates 
we rely on third party service providers to support the distribution of arcalyst and many other related activities in connection with the commercialization of arcalyst for the treatment of caps 
we cannot be certain that these third parties will perform adequately 
if these service providers do not perform their services adequately  our efforts to market and sell arcalyst for the treatment of caps will not be successful 
risks related to the manufacture of our product candidates we have limited manufacturing capacity  which could inhibit our ability to successfully develop or commercialize our drugs 
our manufacturing facility is likely to be inadequate to produce sufficient quantities of product for commercial sale 
we intend to rely on our corporate collaborators  as well as contract manufacturers  to produce the large quantities of drug material needed for commercialization of our products 
we rely entirely on third party manufacturers for filling and finishing services 
we will have to depend on these manufacturers to deliver material on a timely basis and to comply with regulatory requirements 
if we are unable to supply sufficient material on acceptable terms  or if we should encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with our corporate collaborators or contract manufacturers  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be materially harmed 
we must expand our own manufacturing capacity to support the planned growth of our clinical pipeline 
moreover  we may expand our manufacturing capacity to supply commercial quantities of the active pharmaceutical ingredients for our product candidates 
this will require substantial additional expenditures  and we will need to hire and train significant numbers of employees and managerial personnel to staff our facility 
start up costs can be large and scale up entails significant risks related to process development and manufacturing yields 
we may be unable to develop manufacturing facilities that are sufficient to produce drug material for all our clinical trials or for commercial use 
this may delay our clinical development plans and interfere with our efforts to commercialize our products 
in addition  we may be unable to secure adequate filling and finishing services for our products 
as a result  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be materially harmed 
we may also be unable to obtain key raw materials and supplies for the manufacture of arcalyst and our product candidates 
in addition  we may face difficulties in developing or acquiring production technology and managerial personnel to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates at reasonable costs and in compliance with applicable quality assurance and environmental regulations and governmental permitting requirements 
our ability to manufacture our products may be impaired if any of our manufacturing activities are found to infringe third party patents 
the ability for us to manufacture our products in our rensselaer  new york facilities  or to utilize contract manufacturers to produce our products  depends on our ability to operate without infringing the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
other parties may allege that our manufacturing activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights 
a judicial decision in favor of such third parties could preclude such manufacture of our products 
if any of our clinical programs are delayed or discontinued  we may face costs related to the unused capacity at our manufacturing facilities 
we have large scale manufacturing operations in rensselaer  new york 
we use our facilities to produce bulk product for clinical and preclinical candidates for ourselves and our collaborations 
if our clinical candidates are discontinued  or their clinical development is delayed  we may have to absorb one hundred percent of related overhead costs and inefficiencies 
third party supply failures  business interruptions  or natural disasters affecting our manufacturing facilities in rensselaer  new york could adversely affect our ability to supply our products 
we manufacture all of our bulk drug materials at our manufacturing facilities in rensselaer  new york 
we would be unable to manufacture these materials if our rensselaer facilities were to cease production due to regulatory requirements or action  business interruptions  labor shortages or disputes  contaminations  fire  natural disasters  or other problems at the facilities 
certain raw materials necessary for the manufacture and formulation of arcalyst and of our product candidates are provided by single source unaffiliated third party suppliers 
in addition  we rely on certain third parties to perform filling  finishing  distribution  and other services related to the manufacture of arcalyst and our product candidates 
we would be unable to obtain these raw materials or services for an indeterminate period of time if any of these third parties were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these materials  products  or services to us for any reason  including due to regulatory requirements or action  adverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier  failure by the supplier to comply with gmps  business interruptions  or labor shortages or disputes 
this  in turn  could materially and adversely affect our ability to manufacture or supply arcalyst or our product candidates for use in clinical trials or commercial supply  which could materially and adversely affect our business and future prospects 
also  certain of the raw materials required in the manufacture and the formulation of our clinical candidates may be derived from biological sources  including mammalian tissues  bovine serum  and human serum albumin 
there are certain european regulatory restrictions on using these biological source materials 
if we are required to substitute for these sources to comply with european regulatory requirements  our clinical development activities may be delayed or interrupted 
risks related to commercialization of products if we are unable to establish sales  marketing  and distribution capabilities  or to enter into agreements with third parties to do so  we will be unable to successfully market and sell future products 
we are marketing and selling arcalyst for the treatment of caps ourselves in the united states  primarily through third party service providers 
we have no sales or distribution personnel in the united states and have only a small staff with commercial capabilities 
we currently have no sales  marketing  commercial  or distribution capabilities outside the united states 
if we are unable to obtain those capabilities  either by developing our own organizations or entering into agreements with service providers  even if our current or future product candidates receive marketing approval  we will not be able to successfully sell those products 
in that event  we will not be able to generate significant revenue  even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to hire the qualified sales and marketing personnel we need or that we will be able to enter into marketing or distribution agreements with third party providers on acceptable terms  if at all 
under the terms of our collaboration agreement with sanofi aventis  we will rely on sanofi aventis for sales  marketing  and distribution of aflibercept in cancer indications  should it be approved in the future by regulatory authorities for marketing 
we will have to rely on a third party or devote significant resources to develop our own sales  marketing  and distribution capabilities for our other product candidates  including vegf trap eye in the united states and arcalyst for patients with gout initiating uric acid lowering drug therapy if such products receive regulatory approval 
though we are currently actively pursuing establishing our own sales  marketing  and distribution organization in anticipation of filing for and r eceiving regulatory approval to market and sell in the united states vegf trap eye and arcalyst for patients with gout initiating uric acid lowering drug therapy  we may be unsuccessful in doing so  which would harm our business and adversely affect our future prospects 
there may be too few patients with caps to profitably commercialize arcalyst in this indication 
our only approved product is arcalyst for the treatment of caps  a group of rare  inherited auto inflammatory diseases 
these rare diseases affect a very small group of people 
the incidence of caps has been reported to be approximately in  people in the united states 
although the incidence rate of caps in europe has not been reported  it is known to be a rare set of diseases 
in october  we received european marketing authorization for rilonacept for caps 
in  novartis received regulatory approval in the us and europe for its il antibody product for the treatment of caps 
given the very rare nature of the disease and the competition from novartis il antibody product  we may be unable to profitably commercialize arcalyst in this indication 
even if our product candidates are approved for marketing  their commercial success is highly uncertain because our competitors have received approval for and may be marketing products with a similar mechanism of action or may enter the marketplace with better or lower cost drugs 
there is substantial competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries from pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and chemical companies 
many of our competitors have substantially greater research  preclinical and clinical product development and manufacturing capabilities  and financial  marketing  and human resources than we do 
our smaller competitors may also enhance their competitive position if they acquire or discover patentable inventions  form collaborative arrangements  or merge with large pharmaceutical companies 
even if we achieve product commercialization  our competitors have achieved  and may continue to achieve  product commercialization before our products are approved for marketing and sale 
genentech has an approved vegf antagonist  avastin  on the market for treating certain cancers and many different pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working to develop competing vegf antagonists  including novartis  amgen  imclone eli lilly  pfizer  astrazeneca  and glaxosmithkline 
many of these molecules are farther along in development than aflibercept and may offer competitive advantages over our molecule 
each of pfizer  onyx pharmaceuticals together with its partner bayer healthcare  and glaxosmithkline are marketing and selling oral medications that target tumor cell growth and new vasculature fo rmation that fuels the growth of tumors 
the marketing approvals for genentech s vegf antagonist  avastin  and their extensive  ongoing clinical development plan for avastin in other cancer indications  make it more difficult for us to enroll patients in clinical trials to support aflibercept and to obtain regulatory approval of aflibercept in these cancer settings 
this may delay or impair our ability to successfully develop and commercialize aflibercept 
in addition  even if aflibercept is ever approved for sale for the treatment of certain cancers  it will be difficult for our drug to compete against avastin and the fda approved kinase inhibitors  because doctors and patients will have significant experience using these medicines 
in addition  an oral medication may be considerably less expensive fo r patients than a biologic medication  providing a competitive advantage to companies that market such products 
the market for eye disease products is also very competitive 
novartis and genentech are collaborating on the commercialization and further development of a vegf antibody fragment  lucentis  for the treatment of wet amd  dme  and other eye indications 
lucentis was approved by the fda in june for the treatment of wet amd and in june for the treatment of macular edema following rvo 
lucentis was also approved by the ema for wet amd in january and for dme in january many other companies are working on the development of product candidates for the potential treatment of wet amd and dme including those that act by blocking vegf and vegf receptors  as well as sirnas that modulate gene expression 
in addition  ophthalmologists are using off label  with success for the treatment of wet amd  dme  and rvo  a third party repackaged version of genentech s approved vegf antagonist  avastin 
the nei and others are conducting long term  controlled clinical trials comparing lucentis to avastin in the treatment of wet amd 
data from these trials are expected in even if vegf trap eye is ever approved for sale for the treatment of eye diseases  it may be difficult for our drug to compete against lucentis  because doctors and patients have had significant experience using this medicine 
moreover  the relatively low cost of therapy with avastin in patients with wet amd presents a significant competitive challenge in this indication 
while we believe that aflibercept would not be well tolerated if administered directly to the eye  if aflibercept is ever approved for the treatment of certain cancers  there is a risk that third parties will attempt to repackage aflibercept for use and sale for the treatment of wet amd and other diseases of the eye  which would present a potential low cost competitive threat to the vegf trap eye if it is ever approved for sale 
the availability of highly effective fda approved tnf antagonists such as enbrel  remicade  humira adalimumab  a registered trademark of abbott  and simponi golimumab  a registered trademark of centocor  and the il receptor antagonist kineret  and other marketed therapies makes it more difficult to successfully develop and commercialize arcalyst in other indications  and this is one of the reasons we discontinued the development of arcalyst in adult rheumatoid arthritis 
in addition  even if arcalyst is ever approved for sale in indications where tnf antagonists are approved  it will be difficult for our drug to compete against these fda approved tnf antagonists because doctors and patients have had significant experience using these effective medicines 
moreover  in such indications these approved therapeutics may offer competitive advantages over arcalyst  such as requiring fewer injections 
there are both small molecules and antibodies in development by other companies that are designed to block the synthesis of il or inhibit the signaling of il for example  eli lilly  xoma in collaboration with servier  and novartis are each developing antibodies to il and both amgen and medimmune are developing antibodies to the il receptor 
in  novartis received regulatory approval in the us and europe for canakinumab  a fully human anti interleukin il antibody  for the treatment of caps 
canakinumab is also in development for atherosclerosis and a number of other inflammatory diseases 
novartis il antibody and these other drug candidates could offer competitive advantages over arcalyst 
for example  canakinumab is dosed once every eight weeks co mpared to the once weekly dosing regimen for arcalyst 
the successful development and or commercialization of these competing molecules could adversely affect sales of arcalyst for caps and delay or impair our ability to commercialize arcalyst for indications other than caps 
we are developing arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy 
in january  novartis announced that the results of two phase studies with canakinumab focused on reducing pain and preventing recurrent attacks or flares in patients with hard to treat gout were positive 
in addition  novartis announced that it had submitted an application to the ema for approval of canakinumab in gout 
novartis also announced that it plans to submit to the fda in the first quarter of an application for approval of canakinumab in gout 
canakinumab is dosed less frequently for the treatment of caps and may be perceived as offering competitive advantages over arcalyst in gout by some physicians  which would make it difficult for us to successfully commercialize arcalyst in that disease 
currently  inexpensive  oral therapies such as analgesics and other nsaids are used as the standard of care to treat the symptoms of gout diseases 
these established  inexpensive  orally delivered drugs will make it difficult for us to successfully commercialize arcalyst in these diseases 
our early stage clinical candidates in development are all fully human monoclonal antibodies  which were generated using our velocimmune technology 
our antibody generation technologies and early stage clinical candidates face competition from many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies using various technologies 
numerous other companies are developing therapeutic antibody products 
companies such as pfizer  johnson johnson  astrazeneca  amgen  biogen idec  novartis  genentech roche  bristol myers squib  abbott  and glaxosmithkline have generated therapeutic products that are currently in development or on the market that are derived from recombinant dna that comprise human antibody sequences 
we are aware of several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies actively engaged in the research and development of antibody products against targets that are also the targets of our early stage product candidates 
for example  pfizer  johnson johnson  and abbott are developing antibody product candidates against ngf 
genentech roche is marketing an antibody against il r tocilizumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  and several other companies  including centocor ortho biotech and bristol myers squibb  have antibodies against il in clinical development for this disease 
glaxosmithkline  in partnership with oncomed pharmaceuticals  has a dll antibody in clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors 
aerovance has two formulations of a biologic directed against il in clinical development 
amgen previously had an antibody against il r in clinical development for the treatment of asthma 
we believe that several companies  including amgen and pfizer  have development programs for antibodies against pcsk amgen  pfizer  and astrazeneca have development programs underway for antibodies against ang if any of these or other competitors announces a successful clinical study involving a product that may be competitive with one of our product candidates or the grant of marketing approval by a regulatory agency for a competitive product  such developments may have an adverse effect on our operations or future prospects 
the successful commercialization of arcalyst and our product candidates will depend on obtaining coverage and reimbursement for use of these products from third party payers and these payers may not agree to cover or reimburse for use of our products 
our product candidates  if commercialized  may be significantly more expensive than traditional drug treatments 
for example  we are developing arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering drug therapy 
patients suffering from this gout indication are currently treated with inexpensive therapies  including nsaids 
these existing treatment options are likely to be considerably less expensive and may be preferable to a biologic medication for some patients 
our future revenues and profitability will be adversely affected if united states and foreign governmental  private third party insurers and payers  and other third party payers  including medicare and medicaid  do not agree to defray or reimburse the cost of our products to the patients 
if these entities refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement with respect to our products or provide an insufficient level of coverage and reimbursement  our products may be too costly for many patients to afford them  and physicians may not prescribe them 
many third party payers cover only selected drugs  making drugs that are not preferred by such payers more expensive for patients  and require prior authorization or failure on another type of treatment before covering a particular drug 
in particular  payers may impose these obstacles to coverage on higher priced drugs  as our product candidates are likely to be 
we market and sell arcalyst in the united states for the treatment of a group of rare genetic disorders called caps 
we have received european union marketing authorization for rilonacept for the treatment of caps 
there may be too few patients with caps to profitably commercialize arcalyst 
physicians may not prescribe arcalyst  and caps patients may not be able to afford arcalyst  if third party payers do not agree to reimburse the cost of arcalyst therapy and this would adversely affect our ability to commerciali ze arcalyst profitably 
in addition to potential restrictions on coverage  the amount of reimbursement for our products may also reduce our profitability 
government and other third party payers are challenging the prices charged for healthcare products and increasingly limiting  and attempting to limit  both coverage and level of reimbursement for prescription drugs 
in march  the ppaca and a related reconciliation bill were enacted in the us this legislation imposes cost containment measures that are likely to adversely affect the amount of reimbursement for our future products 
the full effects of this legislation are unknown at this time and will not be known until regulations and guidance are issued by the centers for medicare and medicaid services and other federal and state agencies 
some states are also considering legislation that would control the prices o f drugs  and state medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for which supplemental rebates are not being paid 
it is likely that federal and state legislatures and health agencies will continue to focus on additional health care reform in the future that will impose additional constraints on prices and reimbursements for our products 
since arcalyst and our product candidates in clinical development will likely be too expensive for most patients to afford without health insurance coverage  if our products are unable to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement by third party payers  our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates may be adversely impacted 
any limitation on the use of our products or any decrease in the price of our products will have a material negative effect on our ability to achieve profitability 
in certain foreign countries  pricing  coverage  and level of reimbursement of prescription drugs are subject to governmental control  and we may be unable to negotiate coverage  pricing  and reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us 
in some foreign countries  the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed 
the requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country 
for example  the european union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use 
a member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market 
our results of operations may suffer if we are unable to market our products in foreign countries or if coverage and reimbursement for our products in foreign countries is limited or delayed 
risk related to employees we are dependent on our key personnel and if we cannot recruit and retain leaders in our research  development  manufacturing  and commercial organizations  our business will be harmed 
we are highly dependent on certain of our executive officers and other key members of our senior management team 
if we are not able to retain any of these persons or our chairman  our business may suffer 
in particular  we depend on the services of p 
roy vagelos  md  the chairman of our board of directors  leonard schleifer  md  md  our president and chief executive officer  george d 
yancopoulos  md  phd  our executive vice president  chief scientific officer and president  regeneron research laboratories  and neil stahl  phd  our senior vice president  research and development sciences 
as we prepare for commercialization in the united states of our late stage product candidates should they receive regulatory approval  we will also be highly dependent on the expertise and services of members of our senior management leading these commercialization efforts 
there is intense competition in the biotechnology industry for qualified scientists and managerial personnel in the development  manufacture  and commercialization of drugs 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary to continue to advance our business and achieve our strategic objectives 
risks related to our common stock our stock price is extremely volatile 
there has been significant volatility in our stock price and generally in the market prices of biotechnology companies securities 
various factors and events may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
these factors include  by way of example progress  delays  or adverse results in clinical trials  announcement of technological innovations or product candidates by us or competitors  fluctuations in our operating results  third party claims that our products or technologies infringe their patents  public concern as to the safety or effectiveness of arcalyst or any of our product candidates  developments in our relationship with collaborative partners  developments in the biotechnology industry or in government regulation of healthcare  large sales of our common stock by our executive officers  directors  or significant shareholders  arrivals and departures of key personnel  and general market conditions 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and could continue to be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to these and other factors  including the sale or attempted sale of a large amount of our common stock in the market 
broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
future sales of our common stock by our significant shareholders or us may depress our stock price and impair our ability to raise funds in new share offerings 
a small number of our shareholders beneficially own a substantial amount of our common stock 
as of december   our four largest shareholders plus leonard s 
schleifer  m 
d  phd  our chief executive officer  beneficially owned of our outstanding shares of common stock  assuming  in the case of our chief executive officer  the conversion of his class a stock into common stock and the exercise of all options held by him which are exercisable within days of december  in september  sanofi aventis then aventis pharmaceuticals inc purchased  newly issued  unregistered shares of our common stock  and in december sanofi aventis purchased an additional million newly issued  unregistered shares of our common stock 
under our investor agreement  as amended  with sanofi aventis  these shares may not be sold un til december  except under limited circumstances and subject to earlier termination of these restrictions upon the occurrence of certain events 
in addition  in october  sanofi aventis purchased an additional  shares of common stock in our underwritten public offering 
as of december   sanofi aventis beneficially owned  shares of our common stock  representing approximately of the shares of common stock then outstanding 
if sanofi aventis  or our other significant shareholders or we  sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales may occur exists  the market price of our common stock could fall 
sales of common stock by our significant shareholders  including sanofi aventis  also might make it more difficult for us to raise funds by selling equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
our existing shareholders may be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval 
holders of class a stock  who are generally the shareholders who purchased their stock from us before our initial public offering  are entitled to ten votes per share  while holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share 
as of december   holders of class a stock held of the combined voting power of all shares of common stock and class a stock then outstanding 
these shareholders  if acting together  would be in a position to significantly influence the election of our directors and to effect or prevent certain corporate transactions that require majority or supermajority approval of the combined classes  including mergers and other business combinations 
this may result in our taking corporate actions that other shareholders may not consider to be in their best interest and may affect the price of our common stock 
as of d ecember  our current executive officers and directors beneficially owned of our outstanding shares of common stock  assuming conversion of their class a stock into common stock and the exercise of all options held by such persons which are exercisable within days of december   and of the combined voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock and class a stock  assuming the exercise of all options held by such persons which are exercisable within days of december   and our four largest shareholders plus leonard s 
schleifer  md  phd our chief executive officer  beneficially owned of our outstanding shares of common stock  assuming  in the case of our chief executive officer  the conversion of his class a stock into common stock and the exercise of all options held by him which are exercisable within days of december  in addition  these five shareholders held of the combined voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock and class a stock  assuming the exercise of all options held by our chief executive officer which are exercisable within days of december  pursuant to an investor agreement  as amended  sanofi aventis has agreed to vote its shares  at sanofi aventis election  either as recommended by our board of directors or proportionally with the votes cast by our other shareholders  except with respect to certain change of control transactions  liquidation or dissolution  stock issuances equal to or exceeding of the then outstanding shares or voting rights of common stock and class a stock  and new equity compensation plans or amendments if not materially consistent with our historical equity compensation practices 
the anti takeover effects of provisions of our charter  by laws  and of new york corporate law and the contractual standstill provisions in our investor agreement with sanofi aventis  could deter  delay  or prevent an acquisition or other change in control of us and could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  our by laws  and the new york business corporation law contain various provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or our management that shareholders may consider favorable or beneficial 
some of these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
these provisions include authorization to issue blank check preferred stock  which is preferred stock that can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior shareholder approval  with rights senior to those of our common shareholders  a staggered board of directors  so that it would take three successive annual meetings to replace all of our directors  a requirement that removal of directors may only be effected for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of at least eighty percent of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for directors  as well as a requirement that any vacancy on the board of directors may be filled only by the remaining directors  any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting  only if  prior to such action  all of our shareholders consent  the effect of which is to require that shareholder action may only be taken at a duly convened meeting  any shareholder seeking to bring business before an annual meeting of shareholders must provide timely notice of this intention in writing and meet various other requirements  and under the new york business corporation law  in addition to certain restrictions which may apply to business combinations involving the company and an interested shareholder  a plan of merger or consolidation of the company must be approved by two thirds of the votes of all outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon 
see the risk factor immediately above captioned our existing shareholders may be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval 
until the later of the fifth anniversaries of the expiration or earlier termination of our antibody collaboration agreements with sanofi aventis or our aflibercept collaboration with sanofi aventis  sanofi aventis will be bound by certain standstill provisions  as amended  which contractually prohibit sanofi aventis from acquiring more than certain specified percentages of our class a stock and common stock taken together or otherwise seeking to obtain control of the company 
in addition  we have a change in control severance plan and our chief executive officer has an employment agreement that provides severance benefits in the event our officers are terminated as a result of a change in control of the company 
many of our stock options issued under our amended and restated long term incentive plan may become fully vested in connection with a change in control of our company  as defined in the plan 
these contractual provisions may also have the effect of deterring  delaying  or preventing an acquisition or other change in control

we currently have one marketed product arcalyst injection for subcutaneous use  which is available for prescription in the united states for the treatment of caps  including fcas and mws in adults and children and older 
we have product candidates in clinical development  including three that are in late stage phase 
all of these product candidates were discovered in our research laboratories 
our late stage programs are vegf trap eye  which is being developed using intraocular delivery for the treatment of serious eye diseases  arcalyst  which is being developed for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering treatment  and aflibercept  which is being developed in oncology in collaboration with sanofi aventis 
our earlier stage clinical programs include the following fully human antibodies  which are being developed in collaboration with sanofi aventis regn  an antibody to pcsk for ldl cholesterol reduction  regn  an antibody to il r  which is being developed in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis  regn  an antibody to il r  which is being developed in atopic dermatitis and asthma  regn  an antibody to dll  a novel angiogenesis target  which is being developed in oncology  regn  an antibody to ang  another novel angiogenesis target  which is being developed in oncology  regn  an antibody to ngf  which is being developed for the treatment of pain currently on clinical hold  and regn and regn  two antibodies in clinical development against undisclosed targets 
developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and expense 
since inception we have not generated any significant sales or profits from the commercialization of arcalyst or any of our other product candidates 
before significant revenues from the commercialization of arcalyst or our other product candidates can be realized  we or our collaborators must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing research and development and obtaining regulatory approval from the fda and regulatory authorities in other countries 
in addition  the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and new developments may render our products and tech nologies uncompetitive or obsolete 
from inception on january  through december   we had a cumulative loss of billion  principally related to our research and development activities 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development activities  a significant portion of which we expect to be reimbursed by our collaborators 
we plan to submit a bla to the fda in the first half of for marketing approval of vegf trap eye in wet amd in the us in addition  bayer healthcare intends to submit regulatory applications in the first half of for marketing approval of vegf trap eye in wet amd in europe 
if we receive positive phase clinical trial results  we also expect to file for regulatory approval of arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares and of afl ibercept in one or more oncology indications 
we expect to incur substantial costs to prepare for potential commercialization of these late stage product candidates and  if one or more of these product candidates receive regulatory approval  to fund the launch of the product s 
thus  we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses over at least the next few years related primarily to our research and development and commercialization activities 
also  our research and development activities outside our collaborations  the costs of which are not reimbursed  may expand and require additional resources 
our losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on  among other factors  the scope and progress of our research and development efforts  the progress of our efforts to commercialize our late stage product candidates  the timing of certain expenses  and the amount of reimbursement that we receive from collaborators 
we cannot predict whether or when our late stage product candidates will receive regulatory approval or  if such approval is received  whether we will be able to successfully commercialize such product s  or if we do commercialize such product s  whether or when they may become profitable 
a primary driver of our expenses is our number of full time employees 
our annual average headcount in was  compared with in and in in   and our average headcount increased primarily to support our expanded research and development activities in connection with our antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis 
in  we expect our average headcount to increase to approximately  primarily to support the further expansion of our research and development activities  especially in connection with our antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis  and activities in connection with preparing for the potential commercialization of our late stage product candidates 
management of cash flow is extremely important as we continue our research and development activities and prepare for potential commercialization of our late stage product candidates 
our principal sources of cash to date have been from i sales of common equity  both in public offerings and to our collaborators  including sanofi aventis  ii funding from our collaborators and licensees in the form of up front and milestone payments  technology licensing payments  and payments for our research and development activities  and iii a private placement of convertible debt  which was repaid in full during the most significant use of our cash is for research and development activities  which include drug discovery  preclinical studies  clinical trials  and the manufacture of drug supplies for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we are reimb ursed for a substantial portion of these research and development activities by our collaborators 
a significant use of our cash will also be for activities in connection with preparing for the potential commercialization of our late stage product candidates 
the planning  execution  and results of our clinical programs are significant factors that can affect our operating and financial results 
in our clinical programs  key events in and to date were  and plans for the remainder of are  as follows clinical program and events to date plans vegf trap eye reported positive week results in the phase view and view trials in wet amd reported positive six month results in the phase copernicus trial in crvo and completed patient enrollment in the phase galileo trial in crvo reported positive week and week results from the phase dme trial da vinci initiated a phase trial in asia in cnv of the retina as a result of pathologic myopia file for regulatory approval of vegf trap eye in wet amd in the first half of report initial six month data from galileo in the first half of report two year data from view and view  and one year data from copernicus in the second half of if galileo is successful  file for regulatory approval of vegf trap eye in crvo arcalyst reported positive results from pre surge and completed patient enrollment of pre surge and re surge

management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires an assumption or assumptions regarding a future outcome  and changes in the estimate or the use of different assumptions to prepare the estimate could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 
the critical accounting estimates that impact our financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition collaboration revenue we earn collaboration revenue in connection with collaboration agreements to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize our technology platforms 
we currently have collaboration agreements with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare 
the terms of collaboration agreements typically include non refundable up front licensing payments  research progress milestone payments  and payments for development activities 
non refundable up front license payments  where continuing involvement is required of us  are deferred and recognized over the related performance period 
we estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of each agreement  and adjust the performance periods  if appropriate  based on the applicable facts and circumstances 
payments which are based on achieving a specific substantive performance milestone  involving a degree of risk  are recognized as revenue when the milestone is a chieved and the related payment is due and non refundable  provided there is no future service obligation associated with that milestone 
substantive performance milestones typically consist of significant achievements in the development life cycle of the related product candidate  such as completion of clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies  and approvals by regulatory agencies 
in determining whether a payment is deemed to be a substantive performance milestone  we take into consideration i the nature  timing  and value of significant achievements in the development life cycle of the related development product candidate  ii the relative level of effort required to achieve the milestone  and iii the relative level of risk in achieving the milestone  taking into account the high degree of uncertainty in successfully advancing product candidates in a drug development program and in ultimately attaining an approved drug product 
payments for achieving milestones which are not cons idered substantive are accounted for as license payments and recognized over the related performance period 
we enter into collaboration agreements that include varying arrangements regarding which parties perform and bear the costs of research and development activities 
we may share the costs of research and development activities with our collaborator  such as in our vegf trap eye collaboration with bayer healthcare  or we may be reimbursed for all or a significant portion of the costs of our research and development activities  such as in our aflibercept and antibody collaborations with sanofi aventis 
we record our internal and third party development costs associated with these collaborations as research and development expenses 
when we are entitled to reimbursement of all or a portion of the research and development expenses that we incur under a collaboration  we record those reimbursable amounts as collaboration revenue proportionately as we recognize our expenses 
if the collaboration is a cost sharing arrangement in which both we and our collaborator perform development work and share costs  in periods when our collaborator incurs development expenses that benefit the collaboration and regeneron  we also recognize  as additional research and development expense  the portion of the collaborator s development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse 
in connection with non refundable licensing payments  our performance period estimates are principally based on projections of the scope  progress  and results of our research and development activities 
due to the variability in the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug product  changes to development plans as programs progress  and uncertainty in the ultimate requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  revisions to performance period estimates are likely to occur periodically  and could result in material changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year in the future 
in addition  our estimated performance periods may change if development programs encounter delays or we and our collaborators decide to expand or contract our clinical plans for a drug candidate in various disease indications 
als o  if a collaborator terminates an agreement in accordance with the terms of the agreement  we would recognize any unamortized remainder of an up front or previously deferred payment at the time of the termination 
product revenue revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  collection from the customer is reasonably assured  and we have no further performance obligations 
revenue and deferred revenue from product sales are recorded net of applicable provisions for prompt pay discounts  product returns  estimated rebates payable under governmental programs including medicaid  distributor fees  and other sales related deductions 
we review our estimates of rebates payable each period and record any necessary adjustments in the current period s net product sales 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
we outsource a substantial portion of our clinical trial activities  utilizing external entities such as cros  independent clinical investigators  and other third party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical studies 
for each clinical trial that we conduct  certain clinical trial costs are expensed immediately  while others are expensed over time based on the expected total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which patients enter the trial  and the period over which clinical investigators or contract research organizations are expected to provide services 
clinical activities which relate principally to clinical sites and other administrative functions to manage our clinical trials are performed primarily by cros 
cros typically perform most of the start up activities for our trials  including document preparation  site identification  screening and preparation  pre study visits  training  and program management 
on a budgeted basis  these start up costs are typically to of the total contract value 
on an actual basis  this percentage range can be significantly wider  as many of our contracts with cros are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget  while start up costs for the particular trial may not change materially 
these start up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are event driven in nature 
the remaining activities and re lated costs  such as patient monitoring and administration  generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we accrue and recognize expenses in an amount based on our estimate of the remaining non cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the clinical trial and or penalties 
for clinical study sites  where payments are made periodically on a per patient basis to the institutions performing the clinical study  we accrue expense on an estimated cost per patient basis  based on subject enrollment and activity in each quarter 
the amount of clinical study expense recognized in a quarter may vary from period to period based on the duration and progress of the study  the activities to be performed by the sites each quarter  the required level of patient enrollment  the rate at which patients actually enroll in and drop out of the clinical study  and the number of sites involved in the study 
clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically those that have a significant number of sites  require a large number of patients  have complex patient screening requirements  and span multiple years 
during the course of a trial  we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
our estimates and assumptions for clinical expense recognition could differ significantly from our actual results  which could cause material increases or decreases in research and development expenses in future periods when the actual results become known 
no material adjustments to our past clinical trial accrual estimates were made during the years ended december    or stock based employee compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense for grants of stock option awards and restricted stock to employees and non employee members of our board of directors under our long term incentive plans based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the grant date fair value of an award is generally recognized as compensation expense over the award s requisite service period 
we use the black scholes model to compute the estimated fair value of stock option awards 
using this model  fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to i expected volatility of our common stock price  ii the periods of time over which employees and members of our board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise expected lives  iii expected dividend yield on our common stock  and iv risk free interest rates  which are based on quoted us treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options expected lives 
expected volatility has been estimated based on actual movements in our stock price over the most recent historical periods equivalent to the options expected lives 
expected lives are principally based on our historical exercise experience with previously issued employ ee and board of directors option grants 
the expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future 
stock based compensation expense also includes an estimate  which is made at the time of grant  of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited 
this estimate is revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of option awards reflect our best estimates but involve uncertainties related to market and other conditions  many of which are outside of our control 
changes in any of these assumptions may materially affect the fair value of stock options granted and the amount of stock based compensation recognized in future periods 
in addition  we have granted performance based stock option awards which vest based upon the optionee satisfying certain performance and service conditions as defined in the agreements 
potential compensation cost  measured on the grant date  related to these performance options will be recognized only if  and when  we estimate that these options will vest  which is based on whether we consider the options performance conditions to be probable of attainment 
our estimates of the number of performance based options that will vest will be revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods 
changes in these estimates may materially affect the amount of stock based compensation that we recognize in future periods related to performance based options 
marketable securities we have invested our excess cash primarily in direct obligations of the us government and its agencies  other debt securities guaranteed by the us government  and money market funds that invest in us government securities 
we consider our marketable securities to be available for sale  as defined by authoritative guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
these assets are carried at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are included in other accumulated comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders equity 
if the decline in the value of a marketable security in our investment portfolio is deemed to be other than temporary  we write down the security to its current fair value and recognize a loss that may be charged against income 
on a quarterly basis  we review our portfolio of marketable securities  using both quantitative and qualitative factors  to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other than temporary 
such factors include the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost  financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  recommendations of investment advisors  and forecasts of economic  market  or industry trends 
with respect to debt securities  this review process also includes an evaluation of our intent to sell an individual debt security or our need to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery or maturity 
with respect to equity securities  this review process includes an evaluation of our ability and intent to hold the securities until their full value can be recovered 
this review is subjective and r equires a high degree of judgment 
for example  as a result of our quarterly reviews of our marketable securities portfolio  during   and we recorded charges for other than temporary impairment of our marketable securities totaling million  million  and million  respectively 
depreciation of property  plant  and equipment property  plant  and equipment are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
in some situations  the life of the asset may be extended or shortened if circumstances arise that would lead us to believe that the estimated life of the asset has changed 
the life of leasehold improvements may change based on the extension of lease contracts with our landlords 
changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods 
for example  effective in the first quarter of  the estimated useful lives of certain capitalized laboratory and other equipment  which is a component of property  plant  and equipment  were extended 
the effect of this change in estimate was to lower deprec iation expense by million and to lower our net loss per share by for the year ended december  results of operations years ended december  and net loss regeneron reported a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted for the increase in our net loss in was principally due to higher research and development expenses  partly offset by higher collaboration revenue in connection with our antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis

in  sanofi aventis reimbursement of our antibody expenses consisted of million under the discovery agreement and million of development costs under the license agreement  compared to million and million  respectively  in the higher reimbursement amounts in compared to were due to an increase in our research activities conducted under the discovery agreement and increases in our development activities for antibody candidates under the license agreement 
recognition of deferred revenue related to sanofi aventis million up front payment decreased in compared to due to the november amendments to expand and extend the companies antibody collaboration 
in connection with the november amendment of the discovery agreement  sanofi aventis is funding up to million of agreed upon costs incurred by us to expand our manufacturing capacity at our rensselaer  new york facilities  of which million was received or receivable from sanofi aventis as of december  revenue related to these payments for such funding from sanofi aventis is deferred and recognized as collaboration revenue prospectively over the related performance period in conjunction with the recognition of the original million up front payment 
as of december   million of the sanofi aventis payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods 
in august  we entered into a separate velocigene agreement with sanofi aventis 
in and  we recognized million and million  respectively  in revenue related to this agreement 
bayer healthcare collaboration revenue the collaboration revenue we earned from bayer healthcare  as detailed below  consisted of cost sharing of regeneron vegf trap eye development expenses  substantive performance milestone payments  and recognition of revenue related to a non refundable million up front payment received in october and a million milestone payment received in august which  for the purpose of revenue recognition  was not considered substantive 
years ended bayer healthcare collaboration revenue december  in millions cost sharing of regeneron vegf trap eye development expenses substantive performance milestone payments recognition of deferred revenue related to up front and other milestone payments total bayer healthcare collaboration revenue cost sharing of our vegf trap eye development expenses with bayer healthcare increased in compared to due to higher internal development activities and higher clinical development costs in connection with our phase copernicus trial in crvo 
in the fourth quarter of  we earned two million substantive milestone payments from bayer healthcare for achieving positive week results in the view study and positive month results in the copernicus study 
in july  we earned a million substantive performance milestone payment from bayer healthcare in connection with the dosing of the first patient in the copernicus study 
in connection with the recognition of deferred revenue related to the million up front payment and million milestone payment received in august  as of december   million of thes e payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods 
technology licensing revenue in connection with our velocimmune license agreements with astrazeneca and astellas  each of the million annual  non refundable payments were deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue ratably over approximately the ensuing year of each agreement 
in both and  we recognized million of technology licensing revenue related to these agreements 
in addition  in conn ection with the amendment and extension of our license agreement with astellas  in august  we received a million up front payment  which was deferred upon receipt and will be recognized as revenue ratably over a seven year period beginning in mid as of december   million of these technology licensing payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods 
net product sales in and  we recognized as revenue million and million  respectively  of arcalyst net product sales for which both the right of return no longer existed and rebates could be reasonably estimated 
the company had limited historical return experience for arcalyst beginning with initial sales in through the end of  therefore  arcalyst net product sales were deferred until the right of return no longer existed and rebates could be reasonably estimated 
effe ctive in the first quarter of  the company determined that it had accumulated sufficient historical data to reasonably estimate both product returns and rebates of arcalyst 
as a result  million of previously deferred arcalyst net product sales were recognized as revenue in the first quarter of the effect of this change in estimate related to arcalyst net product sales revenue was to lower our net loss per share by in at december   there was no deferred revenue related to arcalyst net product sales

under our collaboration with bayer healthcare  in periods when bayer healthcare incurs vegf trap eye development expenses  we also recognize  as additional research and development expense  the portion of bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse 
bayer healthcare provides us with estimated vegf trap eye development expenses for the most recent fiscal quarter 
bayer healthcare s estimate is reconciled to its actual expenses for such quarter in the subsequent fiscal quarter and our portion of its vegf trap eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse is adjusted accordingly 
payroll and benefits increased principally due to the increase in employee headcount  as described above 
clinical trial expenses decreased due primarily to lower costs related to our phase clinical development program for arcalyst in gout  partly offset by higher costs related to our clinical development programs for vegf trap eye  principally in connection with our copernicus trial in crvo 
clinical manufacturing costs increased due to higher facility related costs in connection with the expansion of our manufacturing capacity at our rensselaer facility and higher costs related to manufacturing clinical supplies of monoclonal antibodies  partly offset by lower costs related to manufacturing aflibercept clinical supplies 
research and other development costs increased primarily due to higher costs associated with our antibody programs 
occupa ncy and other operating costs increased principally in connection with our higher headcount  expanded research and development activities  and new and expanded leased laboratory and office facilities in tarrytown  new york 
cost sharing of bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses increased primarily due to higher costs in connection with the view trial in wet amd which is being conducted by bayer healthcare 
we prepare estimates of research and development costs for projects in clinical development  which include direct costs and allocations of certain costs such as indirect labor  non cash compensation expense  and manufacturing and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects  and  under our collaboration with bayer healthcare  the portion of bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse 
our estimates of research and development costs for clinical development programs are shown below year ended december  increase project costs decrease in millions arcalyst vegf trap eye aflibercept regn regn other antibody candidates in clinical development other research programs unallocated costs total research and development expenses drug development and approval in the united states is a multi step process regulated by the fda 
the process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation  leading up to the submission of an ind to the fda which  if successful  allows the opportunity for study in humans  or clinical study  of the potential new drug 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phases   and the most significant costs in clinical development are in phase clinical trials  as they tend to be the longest and largest studies in the drug development process 
following successful completion of phase clinical trials for a biological product  a bla must be submitted to  and accepted by  the fda  and the fda must approve the bla prior to commercialization of the drug 
it is not uncommon for the fda to request additional data following its review of a bla  which can significantly increase the drug development timeline and expenses 
we may elect either on our own  or at the request of the fda  to conduct further studies that are referred to as phase b and studies 
phase b studies are initiated and either completed or substantially completed while the bla is under fda review 
these studies are conducted under an ind 
phase studies  also referred to as post marketing studies  are studies that are initiated and conducted after the fda has approved a product for marketing 
in addition  as discovery research  preclinical development  and clinical programs progress  opportunities to expand development of drug candidates into new disease indications can emerge 
we may elect to add such new disease indications to our development efforts with the approval of our collaborator for joint development programs  thereby extending the period in which we will be developing a product 
for example  we  and our collaborators where applicable  continue to explore furt her development of arcalyst  aflibercept  and vegf trap eye in different disease indications 
there are numerous uncertainties associated with drug development  including uncertainties related to safety and efficacy data from each phase of drug development  uncertainties related to the enrollment and performance of clinical trials  changes in regulatory requirements  changes in the competitive landscape affecting a product candidate  and other risks and uncertainties described in item a  risk factors under risks related to arcalyst and the development of our product candidates  regulatory and litigation risks  and risks related to commercialization of products 
the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals  and subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
a ny failure by us to obtain  or delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
for these reasons and due to the variability in the costs necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product and the uncertainties related to future indications to be studied  the estimated cost and scope of the projects  and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  accurate and meaningful estimates of the total cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
similarly  we are currently unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows 
in  we received fda approval for arcalyst for the treatment of caps  a group of rare  inherited auto inflammatory diseases that affect a very small group of people 
we currently do not expect to generate material product revenues and net cash inflows from the sale of arcalyst for the treatment of caps 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in due primarily to increases in compensation expense and recruitment costs  principally in connection with higher headcount in  and an increase in non cash compensation expense for the reasons described above 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in and was million and million  respectively  and consisted primarily of royalties and other period costs related to arcalyst commercial supplies 
to date  arcalyst shipments to our customers have primarily consisted of supplies of inventory manufactured and expensed as research and development costs prior to fda approval in  therefore  the costs of these supplies were not included in costs of goods sold 
other income and expense investment income decreased to million in from million in  due primarily to lower yields on  and lower average balances of  cash and marketable securities 
interest expense increased to million in from million in interest expense is primarily attributable to the imputed interest portion of payments to our landlord  commencing in the third quarter of  to lease newly constructed laboratory and office facilities in tarrytown  new york

we classify our investments using a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
the three tiers are level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions

lease tarrytown  new york facilities we lease approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space at facilities in tarrytown  new york  under a december lease agreement  as amended 
these facilities include approximately  square feet of newly constructed space in two new buildings buildings a and b that were completed during the third quarter of and  under a december amendment to the lease  approximately  square feet of additional new space in a third new building building c  which we expect to occupy in early the lease will expire in june and contains three renewal options to extend the term of the lease by five years each  as well as early termination options on approximately  square feet of space 
the lease provides for monthly payments over its term and additional charges for utilities  taxes  and operating expenses 
certain premises under the lease are accounted for as operat ing leases 
however  for buildings a  b  and c that we are leasing  we are deemed  in substance  to be the owner of the landlord s buildings in accordance with the application of fasb authoritative guidance  and the landlord s costs of constructing these new facilities are required to be capitalized on our books as a non cash transaction  offset by a corresponding lease obligation on our balance sheet 
in connection with the lease  we issued a letter of credit to our landlord  currently in the amount of million  which is fully collateralized by cash and marketable securities 
in connection with buildings a and b  we capitalized our landlord s costs of constructing these new facilities  which totaled million as of december   and recognized a corresponding facility lease obligation of million 
we also recognized  as an additional facility lease obligation  reimbursements totaling million from our landlord during and for tenant improvement costs that we incurred since  under fasb authoritative guidance  these reimbursements from our landlord are deemed to be a financing obligation 
monthly lease payments on these facilities are allocated between the land element of the lease which is accounted for as an operating lease and the facility lease obligation  based on the estimated relative fair values of the land and buildings 
the imputed interest rate applicable to the facility lease obli gation is approximately 
at december  and  the facility lease obligation balance in connection with buildings a and b was million and million  respectively

at december  and  the facility lease obligation balance in connection with building c was million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures our cash expenditures for property  plant  and equipment totaled million in  million in  and million in in february  we received million from our landlord in connection with tenant improvement costs in tarrytown 
in addition  as described above  sanofi aventis has funded million of agreed upon capital expenditures incurred by us during to expand our manufacturing capacity at our rensselaer facilities  which was either received or receivable at december  we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately to million in  primarily in connection with tenant improvements at our leased tarrytown facilities  capital improvements at our rensselaer  new york manufacturing facilities  and purchases of equipment 
we expect to be reimbursed for a portion of these capital expenditures for our rensselaer facilities by sanofi aventis  with the remaining amount to be funded by our existing capital resources 
funding requirements our total expenses for research and development from inception through december  were approximately billion 
we have entered into various agreements related to our activities to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize our technology platforms  including collaboration agreements such as those with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare  and agreements to use our velocigene technology platform 
we incurred expenses associated with these agreements  which include reimbursable and non reimbursable amounts  an allocable portion of general and administrative costs  and cost sharing of collaborator s development expenses  where applicable  of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we expect to continue to incur substantial funding requirements for research and development activities including preclinical and clinical testing 
as described above  expenses that we incur in connection with our aflibercept and antibodies collaborations are  generally  fully funded by sanofi aventis 
in addition  as described above  we and bayer healthcare share agreed upon development expenses that both companies incur in connection with our vegf trap eye collaboration 
after taking into account anticipated reimbursements from our collaborators  we currently estimate that approximately of our funding requirements for will be directed toward technology development  basic research and early preclinical activities  and the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates principally  for arcalyst and vegf trap eye 
for  we also currently estimate that approximately of our funding requirements will be directed toward preparing for the potential commercialization of our late stage product candidates  approximately of our funding requirements will be applied to capital expenditures as described above  and the remainder of our funding requirements will be used for general corporate purposes 
in connection with our funding requirements  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  these obligations and commitments assume non termination of agreements and represent expected payments based on current operating forecasts  which are subject to change payments due by period less than greater than total one year to years to years years in millions operating leases capital leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations excludes future contingent costs for utilities  real estate taxes  and operating expenses 
in  these costs were million 
see note a to our financial statements 
purchase obligations primarily relate to i research and development commitments  including those related to clinical trials  ii capital expenditures for equipment acquisitions  and iii license payments 
our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may increase or be reduced based on certain future events 
open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table above 
represents payments with respect to facility lease obligations in connection with our lease of facilities in tarrytown  new york  as described above 
see note a to our financial statements 
under our collaboration with bayer healthcare  over the next several years we and bayer healthcare will share agreed upon vegf trap eye development expenses incurred by both companies  under a global development plan  as described above 
in addition  under our collaboration agreements with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare  if the applicable collaboration becomes profitable  we have contingent contractual obligations to reimburse sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare for a defined percentage generally of agreed upon development expenses incurred by sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare  respectively 
profitability under each collaboration will be measured by calculating net sales less agreed upon expenses 
these reimbursements would be deducted from our share of the collaboration profits and  for our aflibercept collaboration with sanofi aventis  royalties o n product sales in japan otherwise payable to us  unless  in some cases  we elect to reimburse these expenses at a faster rate 
given the uncertainties related to drug development including the development of aflibercept and co developed antibody candidates in collaboration with sanofi aventis and vegf trap eye in collaboration with bayer healthcare  such as the variability in the length of time necessary to develop a product candidate and the ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  we are currently unable to reliably estimate if our collaborations with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare will become profitable 
the amount we need to fund operations will depend on various factors  including the potential regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates  the status of competitive products  the success of our research and development programs  the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff and facilities  the status of patents and other intellectual property rights and pending or future litigation related thereto  the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any of our potential drug candidates  and the continuation  extent  and success of our collaborations with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare 
clinical trial costs are dependent  among other things  on the size and duration of trials  fees charged for services provided by clinical trial investigators and other third parties  the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials  and for supplies  laboratory tests  and other expenses 
the amount of funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and early stage clinical trials  regulatory requirements  the duration and results of clinical trials underway and of additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate  and the various factors that affect the cost of each trial as described above 
our commercialization costs over approximately the next few years will depend on  among other things  the results of phase clinical trials of our late stage product candidates and whether and when such product candidates receive regulatory approval  market potential for such product candidates  and the commercialization terms of our collaboration agreements  if applicable whereby some or all commercialization costs may be shared with our collaborators 
currently  we are required to pay royalties on product sales of arcalyst for the treatment of caps 
in the future  if we are able to successfully develop  market  and sell arcalyst for other indications or certain of our product candidates  we may be required to pay royalties or share the profits from such sales pursuant to our license or collaboration agreements 
we expect that expenses related to the filing  prosecution  defense  and enforcement of patents and other intellectual property will continue to be substantial 
we believe that our existing capital resources  including funding we are entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements  will enable us to meet operating needs through at least however  this is a forward looking statement based on our current operating plan  and there may be a change in projected revenues or expenses that would lead to our capital being consumed significantly before such time 
for example  in connection with preparing to commercialize and launch potential products that are not licensed to a third party  we could incur substantial pre marketing and commercialization expenses that could lead us to consume our cash at a faster rate 
if there is insufficient capital to fund all of our planned operations and activities  we anticipate that we would i seek sources of additional capital through collaborative arrangements and or additional public or private financing  including debt and equity financing and or ii prioritize available capital to fund selected preclinical and clinical development programs and or preparations for the potential commercialization of our late stage product candidates  or license selected products 
other than letters of credits totaling million  including the million letter of credit issued in connection with our lease for facilities in tarrytown  new york  as described above  we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
in addition  we do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity 
as of december   we had million of financing available under a capital equipment lease line 
aside from this lease line  we had no other established banking arrangements through which we could obtain short term financing or a line of credit 
in october  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s registering the sale  in one or more offerings  of an indeterminate amount of equity or debt securities  together or separately 
our october public offering of approximately million shares of common stock was completed under this shelf r egistration statement  however  there is no assurance that we will be able to complete any additional offerings of securities 
factors influencing the availability of additional financing include our progress in product development and commercialization  investor perception of our prospects  and the general condition of the financial markets 
we may not be able to secure the necessary funding through new collaborative arrangements or additional public or private offerings 
if we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements  we may have to delay  scale back  or eliminate certain of our research and development activities or future operations 
this could materially harm our business 
future impact of recently issued accounting standards in october  the fasb amended its authoritative guidance on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the amended guidance provides greater ability to separate and allocate consideration to be received in a multiple element revenue arrangement by requiring the use of estimated selling prices to allocate the consideration  thereby eliminating the use of the residual method of allocation 
the amended guidance also requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures surrounding multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this guidance may be applied retrospectively or prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements 
we will adopt this amended guidance effective for the fiscal year beginning january  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb amended its authoritative guidance on the milestone method of revenue recognition 
the milestone method of revenue recognition has now been codified as an acceptable revenue recognition model when a milestone is deemed to be substantive 
this guidance may be applied retrospectively to all arrangements or prospectively for milestones achieved after the adoption of the guidance 
we will adopt this amended guidance for the fiscal year beginning january  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates  principally in connection with our investments in marketable securities  which consist primarily of direct obligations of the us government and its agencies  other debt securities guaranteed by the us government  and money market funds that invest in us government securities 
we do not believe we are materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we estimate that a one percent unfavorable change in interest rates would have resulted in approximately a million and million decrease in the fair value of our investment portfolio at december  and  respectively 
the increase in interest rate risk year over year is due primarily to higher balances of marketable debt securities with maturities in excess of one year that we held at december  compared to credit quality risk we have an investment policy that includes guidelines on acceptable investment securities  minimum credit quality  maturity parameters  and concentration and diversification 
nonetheless  deterioration of the credit quality of an investment security subsequent to purchase may subject us to the risk of not being able to recover the full principal value of the security 
we have recognized other than temporary impairment charges related to certain marketable securities of million  million  and million in   and  respectively
