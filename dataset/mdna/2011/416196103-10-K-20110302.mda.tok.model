we continue to evaluate all of our circulation performance and may make further circulation reductions in the future as part of our efforts to address the difficult economic conditions in california and florida 
we derive revenues from the sale of direct marketing services and shopper advertising services 
as a worldwide business  direct marketing is affected by general national and international economic trends 
direct marketing revenues are also affected by economic fundamentals of each industry that we serve  various market factors  including the demand for services by our clients  and the financial condition of and budgets available to specific clients  among other factors 
our shoppers operate in regional markets in california and florida and are greatly affected by the strength of the state and local economies 
our businesses continued to face challenging economic environments in  which negatively impacted our financial performance 
marketing budgets are often more discretionary in nature  and are easier to reduce in the short term than other expenses in response to weak economic conditions 
difficult economic conditions and consolidation and bankruptcies of customers and prospective customers in the industry verticals that we serve have resulted in pricing pressures and in reduced demand for our products and services 
direct marketing revenues are dependent on  among other things  national  regional and international economic and business conditions 
while we did see revenue growth in our direct marketing business in  economic conditions remain difficult both in the united states and internationally 
the economic environment in the united states and other economies continue to adversely impact the marketing expenditures and activities of our customers  resulting in pricing pressures  significant reductions and delays in spending by clients and prospective clients 
revenues from our shoppers business are largely dependent on local advertising expenditures in the areas of california and florida in which we operate 
such expenditures are substantially affected by the strength of the local economies in those markets 
during  the negative trends and economic conditions that we have experienced since the second half of in california and florida continued 
these conditions were initially created by weakness in the real estate and associated financing markets and have spread across virtually all categories 
although economic uncertainty remains  and we believe that will continue to be challenging  we have seen some signs of improvement in both businesses over the last few quarters 
due to the structural changes we have made across our entire company  we believe that we are well positioned for an improved economic environment 
our principal operating expense items are labor  postage and transportation

under the postal accountability and enhancement act of  the usps can file for a rate increase in february of each year  and any increase will take effect the following april

at this point we believe the next postal rate increase will likely occur in april and will be less than 
overall shoppers postage costs will be affected by any future increases in postage rates 
the u

outlook we consider such factors as total cash and cash equivalents  current assets  current liabilities  total debt  revenues  operating income  cash flows from operations  investing activities and financing activities when assessing our liquidity 
our primary sources of liquidity have been cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated from operating activities 
our management of cash is designed to optimize returns on cash balances and to ensure that it is readily available to meet our operating  investing and financing requirements as they 
table of contents arise 
capital resources are also available from and provided through our revolving credit facility  subject to the terms and conditions of that facility 
the amount of cash on hand and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility are influenced by a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  revenue growth  accounts receivable collections  working capital changes  capital expenditures  tax payments  share repurchases  pension plan contributions  acquisitions and dividends 
developments in the financial markets have increased our exposure to the possible liquidity and credit risks of counterparties to our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had million of unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  and we have not experienced any limitations to date on our ability to access this source of liquidity 
at december   we had a cash balance of million 
based on our current operational plans  we believe that our cash on hand  cash provided by operating activities  and availability under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund operations  anticipated capital expenditures  payments of principal and interest on our borrowings  and dividends on our common stock for at least the next months 
when the term loan facility matures in september  we will have to pay the final scheduled principal payment of million 
we plan to make this payment using a combination of cash on hand at that time and availability under the revolving credit facility 
nevertheless  we cannot predict the impact on our business performance of the economic climate in the united states and other economies 
a lasting economic recession in the united states and other economies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position or operating results 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that  in our judgment  are most important to the portrayal of our company s financial condition and results of operations and which require complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
the areas that we believe involve the most significant management estimates and assumptions are detailed below 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
historically  actual results have not differed significantly from our estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are satisfied i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii collectability is reasonably assured  and iv the service has been performed or the product has been delivered 
payments received in advance of the performance of services or delivery of the product are recorded as deferred revenue until such time as the services are performed or the product is delivered 
our accounting policy for revenue recognition has an impact on our reported results and relies on certain estimates that require judgments on the part of management 
the portion of our revenue that is most subject to estimates and judgments is revenue recognized using the proportional performance method  as discussed below 
direct marketing revenue is derived from a variety of services and products  and may be billed at hourly rates  monthly rates or a fixed price 
for all sales  we require either a purchase order  a statement of work signed by the client  a written contract  or some other form of written authorization from the client 
revenue from agency and creative services  analytical services and market research is typically billed based on time and materials or at a fixed price 
if billed at a fixed price  revenue is recognized on a proportional performance basis as the services specified in the arrangement are performed 
in most cases  proportional performance is based on the ratio of direct costs incurred to total estimated costs where the costs incurred  primarily labor hours and outsourced services  represent a reasonable surrogate for output measures or contract performance 
for fixed fee market research revenue streams  revenue is recognized in proportion to the value of service provided based on output criteria 
contracts accounted for under the proportional performance 
table of contents method constituted less than of total direct marketing revenue and less than of our total revenue for each of the years ended december   and revenue from email marketing  social media marketing and other digital solutions is recognized as the work is performed

revenue associated with new marketing database builds is deferred until complete or until client acceptance 
upon completion or acceptance  revenue and direct build costs are then recognized over the term of the related arrangement as the services are provided 
revenue from database and website hosting services is recognized ratably over the contractual hosting period 
pricing for database builds are typically based on a fixed price and hosting fees are typically based on a fixed price per month or per contract 
revenue from technology database subscriptions is based on a fixed price and is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 
revenue from stand alone technology data sales is recognized at the time of delivery 
revenue from services such as data processing  printing  personalization of communication pieces using laser and inkjet printing  targeted mail  and transportation logistics is recognized as the work is performed 
revenue from these services is typically based on a fixed price or rate given to the client 
revenue related to fulfillment and contact centers  including inbound and outbound calling and email management  is also typically based on a fixed price per transaction or service provided 
revenue from these services is recognized as the service or activity is performed 
revenue from software arrangements involving multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the vendor specific objective evidence of fair values of the respective elements 
for software sales with multiple elements for example  software licenses with undelivered post contract customer support or pcs  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
this means we defer revenue from the software sale equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
the fair value of pcs is based upon separate sales of renewals to other clients 
the fair value of services  such as training and consulting  is based upon separate sales of these services to other clients 
the revenue allocated to pcs is recognized ratably over the term of the support period 
revenue allocated to professional services is recognized as the services are performed 
the revenue allocated to software products  including time based software licenses  is recognized  if collection is probable  upon execution of a licensing agreement and shipment of the software or ratably over the term of the license  depending on the structure and terms of the arrangement 
if the licensing agreement is for a term of one year or less and includes pcs  we recognize the software and the pcs revenue ratably over the term of the license 
for certain non software arrangements  we enter into contracts that include delivery of a combination of two or more of our service offerings 
such arrangements are divided into separate units of accounting  provided that the delivered element s has stand alone value and objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element s exist s 
when we are able to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting  revenue from each service is recognized separately  and in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for each element 
if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting  we apply one of the revenue recognition policies to the entire arrangement 
this might impact the timing of revenue recognition  but would not change the total revenue recognized from the arrangement 
shopper services are considered rendered  and the revenue recognized  when all printing  sorting  labeling and ancillary services have been provided and the mailing material has been received by the usps 

table of contents taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not reflected in our revenues or expenses 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain our allowance for doubtful accounts at a balance adequate to reduce accounts receivable to the amount of cash expected to be realized upon collection 
the methodology used to determine the allowance balance is based on our prior collection experience and is generally related to the accounts receivable balance in various aging categories 
the balance is also influenced by specific clients financial strength and circumstance 
accounts that are determined to be uncollectible are written off in the period in which they are determined to be uncollectible 
periodic changes to the allowance balance are recorded as increases or decreases to bad debt expense  which is included in the advertising  selling  general and administrative line of our consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded bad debt expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december  and our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million  respectively 
while we believe our reserve estimate to be appropriate  we may find it necessary to adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if future bad debt expense exceeds the estimated reserve 
current economic conditions increase the difficulty and level of management judgment in setting the reserve 
given the significance of accounts receivable to the consolidated financial statements  the determination of net realizable values is considered to be a critical accounting estimate 
reserve for healthcare  workers compensation  automobile and general liability we are self insured for our workers compensation  automobile  general liability and a portion of our healthcare insurance 
we make various subjective judgments about a number of factors in determining our reserve for healthcare  workers compensation  automobile and general liability insurance  and the related expense 
our deductible for individual healthcare claims is million 
our deductible for workers compensation is million per claim 
we have a million deductible per claim automobile and general liability 
our insurance administrator provides us with estimated loss reserves  based upon its experience dealing with similar types of claims  as well as amounts paid to date against these claims 
we apply actuarial factors to both insurance estimated loss reserves and to paid claims and then determine reserve levels  taking into account these calculations 
at december  and  our reserve for healthcare  workers compensation  automobile and general liability was million and million  respectively 
if ultimate losses were higher than our estimate at december   net income would be impacted by approximately million  net of taxes 
the amount that earnings would be impacted is dependent on the claim year and our deductible levels for that plan year 
periodic changes to the reserve for workers compensation  automobile and general liability are recorded as increases or decreases to insurance expense  which is included in the advertising  selling  general and administrative line of our consolidated statements of operations 
periodic changes to the reserve for healthcare are recorded as increases or decreases to employee benefits expense  which is included in the labor line of our consolidated statements of operations 
goodwill goodwill is recorded to the extent that the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
we assess the impairment of our goodwill by determining the fair value of each of our reporting units and comparing the fair value to the carrying value for each reporting unit 
we have identified our reporting units as direct marketing and shoppers 
at december  and  the net book value of our goodwill was allocated to our reporting units as follows 
table of contents december  in thousands direct marketing shoppers total goodwill we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing for both the direct marketing and shoppers segments as of november  as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units  estimated fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow dcf model and a cash flow multiple cfm model  with consideration of our overall market capitalization 
the dcf and cfm models utilize projected financial results based on historical performance and management s estimate of future performance  giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive and economic conditions 
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments  including judgments about appropriate discount rates  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  and perpetual growth rates 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  we must calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities recognized and unrecognized in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  and then compare this implied fair value to its carrying amount 
to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded 
a summary of the critical assumptions utilized for our annual impairment test in are outlined below 
we believe this information  coupled with our sensitivity analysis  provide relevant information to understand our goodwill impairment testing and evaluate our goodwill balances 
for the annual goodwill impairment test performed on november   we did not significantly change the methodology from to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
we made changes to certain assumptions utilized in the models for compared with the prior year due to the us and global economic environments  which affect direct marketing  and the economic environments in california and florida  which affect shoppers 
the following is a summary analysis of the significant assumptions used in our models  as well as a sensitivity analysis on the impact of changes in certain assumptions to our overall conclusion concerning impairment of our goodwill balances 
discount rate the discount rate represents the expected return on capital 
the discount rate was determined using a target structure of debt and equity 
we used the interest rate of a year government security to determine the risk free rate in our weighted average cost of capital calculation 
growth assumptions projected annual growth rates and terminal growth rates are primarily driven by management s best estimate of future performance  giving consideration to historical performance and existing and anticipated economic and competitive conditions 
these assumptions also take into account expense reductions and restructuring measures taken in in both businesses 
the assumed growth rates used in our calculations were lower than historical growth rates for the respective businesses 
sensitivity analysis the estimated fair value of our direct marketing reporting unit was significantly above its carrying value 
in order to analyze the sensitivity of our assumptions on the results of our shoppers impairment assessment  we determined the impact that a hypothetical reduction in fair value would have on our conclusions 
in the case of our shoppers reporting unit  a decline in fair value would not result in the reporting unit s carrying value to be in excess of its fair value 

table of contents the determination of the recoverability of goodwill requires significant judgment and estimates regarding future cash flows and fair values 
these estimates are subject to change and could result in impairment losses being recognized in the future 
if different reporting units or different valuation methodologies had been used  the impairment test results could have differed 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of share based awards requires judgment  including in some cases estimating expected term  volatility and dividend yield 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from some of these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded total stock based compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements as discussed in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements  certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future 
the adoption of these new accounting pronouncements have not and are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we face market risks related to interest rate variations and to foreign currency exchange rate variations 
from time to time  we may utilize derivative financial instruments as described below to manage our exposure to such risks 
we are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates related to our credit facilities 
our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our credit facilities  which bear interest at variable rates based on eurodollar rates effective day euro dollar rate of at december  
the five year million term loan facility has a maturity date of september  at december   our debt balance related to the term loan facility was million 
the four year term loan facility has a maturity date of march  at december   our debt balance related to the term loan facility was million 
the three year million revolving credit facility has a maturity date of august  at december   we did not have any debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
in september  we entered into a two year interest rate swap with a notional amount of million and a fixed rate of in order to limit a portion of our interest rate exposure by converting a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
this interest rate swap expired on september  assuming the actual level of borrowing throughout  and assuming a one percentage point change in the year s average interest rates  it is estimated that our net income would have changed by approximately million 
due to our overall debt level and cash balance at december   anticipated cash flows from operations  and the various financial alternatives available to management should there be an adverse change in interest rates  we do not believe that we currently have significant exposure to market risks associated with changing interest rates 
our earnings are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our operations in foreign countries 
our primary exchange rate exposure is to the euro  british pound sterling  australian dollar  philippine peso and brazilian real 
we monitor these risks throughout the normal course of business 
the majority of the transactions of our us and foreign operations are denominated in the respective local 
table of contents currencies 
changes in exchange rates related to these types of transactions are reflected in the applicable line items making up operating income in our consolidated statements of operations 
due to the current level of operations conducted in foreign currencies  we do not believe that the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on these types of transactions is significant to our overall annual earnings 
a smaller portion of our transactions are denominated in currencies other than the respective local currencies 
for example  inter company transactions that are expected to be settled in the near term are denominated in us dollars 
since the accounting records of our foreign operations are kept in the respective local currency  any transactions denominated in other currencies are accounted for in the respective local currency at the time of the transaction 
any foreign currency gain or loss from these transactions  whether realized or unrealized  results in an adjustment to income  which is recorded in other  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
transactions such as these amounted to million in pre tax currency transaction losses in at this time we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging 
we do not speculate using derivative instruments
