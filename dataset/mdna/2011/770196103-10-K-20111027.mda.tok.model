item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered  application critical equipment and systems for the energy  industrial  chemical and pharmaceutical markets worldwide 
with our acquisition of t energy services  inc t on january  the acquisition date  we are expanding and complementing our energy business in our fluid management segment  and creating a stronger strategic platform with better scale to support future growth 
we attribute our success to our close and continuing interaction with customers  our manufacturing  sourcing and application engineering expertise and our ability to serve customers globally 
we have initiated restructuring programs to reduce manufacturing capacity while increasing utilization  standardizing product offerings to allow greater utilization of our lower cost manufacturing facilities  leveraging functional resources  and further integrating our business activities 
we expect to continue our restructuring and streamlining efforts in certain businesses and pursue our organic and strategic growth initiatives to improve our competitiveness  financial results  long term profitability and shareholder value 
having mostly integrated the t business in fiscal  we expect to complete these efforts in fiscal our fiscal corporate priorities also include improving the performance of our process solutions group  developing our aftermarket initiatives  expanding our capabilities in faster growing global regions and pursuing acquisitions 
the demand for the company s products increased in fiscal as compared with fiscal  resulting in aggregate year over year sales growth and improved margins 
although we continue to see strong demand across our end markets  global economic sentiment is uncertain 
we are cautiously optimistic that recent market trends  primarily in our emerging markets and for certain product lines  especially serving oil and gas markets  will continue to grow in fiscal our company has a venezuelan subsidiary with net sales  operating income and total assets representing approximately one percent of our consolidated financial statement amounts in fiscal and in early january  the venezuelan government devalued its currency 
our subsidiary operated under a rate of bolivars to the us dollar  as compared with the previous rate of  and our fiscal and fiscal year end financial statements reflected this new rate 
in addition  the financial statements of our venezuelan subsidiary were consolidated and reported under highly inflationary accounting rules under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  resulting in a translation loss of million recorded in the income statement during fiscal the fiscal devaluation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in fiscal with approximately of our sales outside the united states  we can be affected by changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and the foreign currencies in non us countries in which we operate 
the impact on net income  sales and orders due to foreign exchange changes was not material for fiscal compared with fiscal additionally  the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date  with related gains or losses reported as a separate component of our shareholders equity  except for venezuela  which is reported following highly inflationary accounting rules under us gaap  as mentioned above 
the marginal strengthening of most foreign currencies against the us dollar in fiscal did not materially impact our financial condition at the end of fiscal as compared with the end of fiscal as mentioned above  on january   we acquired of the outstanding common stock and voting interests of t for a purchase price of approximately million  which consisted of approximately million in cash  million as the fair value of our common shares and million as the fair value of options and warrants issued to replace t grants for pre merger services and warrants 
the operating results of t are included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date within our fluid management segment 
t designs  manufactures  repairs and services products used in the drilling  completion and production of new oil and gas wells  the workover of existing wells  and the production and transportation of oil and gas 
its products are used in both onshore and offshore applications throughout the world 
the company has achieved its first year integration savings  however  we caution readers that while pre and post acquisition comparisons as well as quantified amounts themselves may provide indications of general trends  actual cost savings and operating results due to the merger may differ from previous management estimates 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into an agreement to divest our romaco businesses romaco segment which design  manufacture and market packaging and secondary processing equipment for the pharmaceutical  healthcare  nutraceutical  food and cosmetic industries 
this divestiture was part of the company s portfolio management process and operating strategy to simplify the business and improve its profit profile  and to focus on growing the company around core competencies 
the results of operations for our romaco segment are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
on april   we completed the sale of all the shares and equity interest in our romaco businesses for a consideration of approximately million approximately million at the time of closing  which included million in cash and million of liabilities assumed 
for fiscal  income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  was approximately million 
the gain on disposal included the realization of amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss of million 
for tax purposes  the gain on disposal of the romaco segment was minimal 
see note in item of this report 
with the sale of our romaco segment  our business consists of two market focused segments fluid management  which includes t  and process solutions 
fluid management 
order levels from customers served by our fluid management segment continued to show strong year over year improvements in fiscal compared with fiscal demand for our energy products and services remained robust and industrial demand improved 
our primary objectives for this segment are to increase our manufacturing capacity to meet current demand  expand our geographic reach  improve our selling and product management capabilities  commercialize new products in our niche market sectors  develop new customer relationships  and obtain further merger related cost savings and synergies 
our fluid management business segment  which includes t  designs  manufactures  markets  repairs and services equipment and systems including hydraulic drilling power sections  blow out preventers bops  pressure control systems  wellhead equipment  frac manifolds and trees  high pressure engineered gate valves  down hole and industrial progressing cavity pumps and related products such as grinders for applications involving the flow of viscous  abrasive and solid laden slurries and sludge  standard and customized fluid agitation equipment and systems  and a broad line of ancillary equipment for the energy sector  such as rod guides  rod and tubing rotators  pipeline closure products and valves 
these products are used in oil and gas exploration and recovery  specialty chemical  wastewater treatment and a variety of other industrial applications 
process solutions 
our process solutions segment orders improved in fiscal over fiscal  achieving the highest levels since fiscal however  pricing has not fully recovered for european chemical market capital goods 
our primary objectives are to reduce operating costs in developed regions  increase manufacturing capabilities in low cost areas and increase aftermarket opportunities 
our process solutions business segment designs  manufactures and services glass lined reactors and storage vessels  customized equipment  systems and fluoropolymer lined fittings  vessels and accessories  primarily for the pharmaceutical and specialty chemical markets 
results of operations the following tables present components of our consolidated statement of income and segment information for our continuing operations 
consolidated sales cost of sales gross profit sg a expenses other expense ebit by segment fluid management in millions  except percents sales ebit ebit process solutions sales ebit ebit consolidated sales ebit ebit the comparability of the operating results has been impacted by restructuring costs in fiscal and  as well as merger related costs in fiscal see note statement of income information in item of this report for further discussion 
in addition  the comparability of the segment data is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  due to the translation of non us dollar denominated subsidiary results into us dollars  acquisition of t included in our fluid management segment on january   as well as general economic conditions in the end markets we serve 
the company s operating performance is evaluated using several measures 
one of those measures  ebit  is income before interest and income taxes and is reconciled to net income on our consolidated statement of income 
we evaluate performance of our business segments and allocate resources based on ebit 
ebit is not  however  a measure of performance calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of our operating results 
ebit is not a measure of cash available for use by management 
fiscal year ended august  compared with fiscal year ended august  net sales consolidated net sales from continuing operations for fiscal were million  or million higher than fiscal net sales  an increase of 
excluding the impact of currency translation and the t acquisition  net sales increased by million  or  due to higher sales in both of our segments in fiscal the fluid management segment  which includes t results since january   had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation and t acquisition  sales in fiscal increased million  or 
the increase was primarily in our energy markets  due to strong growth in horizontal rigs  as exploration and production companies invested to capture oil and gas from shale formations in north america 
orders for this segment were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal excluding currency and acquisition impacts  orders in fiscal grew million  or  due to strong market conditions 
ending backlog at august   including t backlog of million  was million compared with million at august  the process solutions segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
excluding currency impact  sales in fiscal increased million  or  from the prior year  due to improving demand for capital goods in global chemical markets 
segment orders in fiscal continued to improve from fiscal and were million  compared with million in fiscal excluding currency impact  orders increased million  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal  reflecting improved demand in certain end markets outside europe 
ending backlog at august  was million compared with million at august  earnings before interest and income taxes ebit consolidated ebit from continuing operations for fiscal was million compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million 
excluding the impacts of currency translation and acquisition  consolidated ebit in fiscal increased by million 
this increase in consolidated ebit  despite higher costs associated with the t acquisition of million  was mainly attributable to the higher sales volume described above in all our business platforms and a favorable sales mix in our fluid management segment 
we also experienced million of lower restructuring charges in our process solutions segment in fiscal compared with fiscal the fluid management segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal excluding currency and acquisition impacts  ebit for fiscal increased by million  or  due principally to the sales increase and a favorable product mix 
the process solutions segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared with a loss of million in fiscal this increase in ebit resulted from higher sales volume in fiscal  as well as lower restructuring charges of million 
corporate costs were million higher in fiscal compared with fiscal  primarily due to million of costs associated with professional fees and accelerated stock compensation expense related to the t merger transaction 
income taxes our effective tax rate for continuing operations was for fiscal compared with in fiscal the current year effective tax rate is higher than the us statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate in fiscal  primarily due to the recording of an additional valuation allowance of million for certain deferred tax assets in our process solutions segment 
excluding this impact  the effective tax rate for fiscal was lower than the us federal statutory tax rate primarily due to certain us permanent deductions and tax credits 
the effective tax rate for fiscal from continuing operations approximated the us federal statutory tax rate 
net income our net income in fiscal  which includes income from discontinued operations  net of tax  of million see note discontinued operations in item of this report  was million compared with million in fiscal  which included net income from discontinued operations of million 
net income from continuing operations in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal the increase in fiscal net income was primarily driven by higher sales volume and a favorable product mix  somewhat reduced by charges relating to the acquisition of t fiscal year ended august  compared with fiscal year ended august  net sales consolidated sales from continuing operations for fiscal were million compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
excluding the impact of currency translation  sales decreased by million  or due to lower sales in both of our segments in the first six months of fiscal sales in the second half of fiscal were higher than the comparable period of the prior year 
the fluid management segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  sales declined by million  or 
the year over year sales decrease was primarily due to lower customer demand early in fiscal resulting from reduced levels of oil and gas exploration and recovery activity in that period 
there was higher activity in the second half of fiscal over the same period in the prior year which was driven by higher oil prices worldwide  a higher level of demand for horizontal drilling rigs used in north american shale formations and higher general industrial activity 
orders for this segment were impacted by the same factors and were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal excluding the impact of foreign currency  orders grew million in fiscal over fiscal ending backlog of million was higher than at the end of the prior year 
the process solutions segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
excluding the impact of currency translation  sales decreased by million  or from results which benefited from significant backlog at the beginning of the fiscal year 
orders in fiscal  however  improved from the latter half of fiscal to million due to improved market conditions 
excluding foreign currency impact  orders increased by million  or over prior year 
demand in our western chemical markets was weak  while demand in our asian market was favorable 
ending backlog of million was higher than at the end of prior year 
earnings before interest and income taxes ebit consolidated ebit from continuing operations for fiscal was million compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
results for fiscal included other expense of million related to restructuring costs in our process solutions segment 
excluding the impacts of other expense and currency  consolidated ebit decreased million mainly due to lower sales volume described above in both of our segments  a million highly inflationary currency loss related to our venezuelan operations  european pricing pressures in our process solutions segment and higher corporate costs related to strategic and legal matters 
consistent with the sales variances described above  the unfavorable variances related primarily to the first six months of the fiscal year 
the fluid management segment ebit for fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal excluding the currency rate impact  ebit decreased million or due primarily to the sales decrease described above and the venezuelan highly inflationary currency loss  offset by an insurance recovery of million  an asset sale gain of million and favorable product mix 
the process solutions segment had an ebit loss of million in fiscal  compared with ebit of million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
excluding the impact of currency translation  ebit declined million 
this decrease is due principally to lower sales  restructuring costs of million and european pricing pressures in fiscal corporate costs were million higher in fiscal over the prior year mainly due to costs associated with strategic and legal matters 
income taxes our effective tax rate for continuing operations was in fiscal and in fiscal the fiscal effective tax rate for continuing operations approximated the us federal statutory tax rate 
the fiscal effective tax rate for our continuing operations was lower than the us federal statutory tax rate due to a non recurring tax planning gain and finalizing earlier tax estimates 
net income our net income in fiscal  which included net income from discontinued operations  net of tax  of million  was million compared with million in fiscal  which included net income from discontinued operations  net of tax  of million 
the decrease in net income in fiscal compared with fiscal was a result of lower sales  pricing pressures in certain product lines  higher costs related to restructuring  legal and strategic matters and a higher tax rate  partly offset by cost reduction initiatives 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities in fiscal  our cash inflow from operating activities was million  compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million 
this increase was caused by higher net income  somewhat reduced by higher working capital needs in fiscal to support our sales and profit growth  payments for restructuring costs accrued at the end of fiscal  increased funding for us pension plans  and payments related to accruals in the opening balance sheet of t cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to working capital needs and the timing of payments for items such as income taxes  restructuring activities  pension funding and other items 
we expect our available cash  fiscal operating cash flow and availability under our credit agreement to be adequate to fund fiscal year operating needs  shareholder dividends  capital expenditures  and additional share repurchases  if any 
investing activities in fiscal  the company continued to generate substantial cash from operating activities  which resulted in a strong year end financial position  with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses and acquisitions 
our net cash outflows relating to investing activities for fiscal of million included million of cash used for the t acquisition  net of cash acquired  cash proceeds from sale of our romaco businesses of million and million of capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in fiscal were million higher than in fiscal and were primarily related to our cost reduction and sales growth initiatives 
in fiscal  our net cash outflows from investing activities of million consisted of capital expenditures of approximately million and asset sale proceeds of million related to the sale of certain of our assets at two of our business units 
in fiscal  our net cash outflows from investing activities of million consisted of capital expenditures of approximately million and the purchase of the remaining percent noncontrolling interest in our process solutions group chinese subsidiary for million  which we funded from available cash balances 
the company expects fiscal capital spending to be substantially higher than in fiscal in order to support expected growth  depending on business conditions and the success of certain customer initiatives 
financing activities our cash inflows from financing activities for fiscal were million 
proceeds from the sale of common stock were million in fiscal and were primarily due to exercise of stock options and related tax benefits 
dividends paid during fiscal were million  or million higher than fiscal  primarily due to additional shares issued in january related to our t merger 
the quarterly dividend rate per common share was increased in january from to 
from available cash balances  we repaid the remaining million of senior notes on the may  maturity date 
on october   we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our currently outstanding common shares 
we acquired approximately million of our outstanding common shares for million under the repurchase program in fiscal there were no such share repurchases in fiscal and subsequent to year end  on october   the company announced that its board of directors had authorized to repurchase up to million of the company s outstanding common shares  in addition to the approximately million currently available for repurchase under the october authorization by the board of directors 
repurchases will generally be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions that will not exceed prevailing market prices  subject to regulatory considerations and market conditions 
repurchases will be funded from the company s available cash and credit facilities 
credit agreement on march   we entered into a new bank credit agreement the agreement 
the agreement replaces our previous bank credit agreement which would have expired in december the agreement provides that we may borrow  for the five year term of the agreement  on a revolving credit basis up to a maximum of million at any one time 
in addition  under the terms of the agreement  we are entitled  on up to six occasions prior to the maturity of the loan  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  to increase the aggregate commitments under the agreement in the aggregate principal amount of up to million 
all outstanding amounts under the agreement are due and payable on march  interest is variable based upon formulas tied to a eurocurrency rate or an alternative base rate defined in the agreement  at our option 
borrowings  which may also be used for general corporate purposes  are unsecured  but are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries 
while no amounts are outstanding under the agreement at august   we have million of standby letters of credit outstanding at august  these standby letters of credit are used as security for advance payments received from customers and for future payments to our vendors 
accordingly  under the agreement  we have million of unused borrowing capacity 
the agreement contains customary representations and warranties  default provisions and affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations on indebtedness  liens  asset sales  mergers and other fundamental changes involving the company  permitted investments  sales and lease backs  cash dividends and share repurchases  and financial covenants relating to interest coverage and leverage 
as of august   we are in compliance with these covenants 
segments effective in the first quarter of fiscal  the company reorganized its management structure resulting in a realignment of its operating segments 
as a result  the company s operating segments will be energy services  which includes the r m energy and t product lines  and process and flow control  which includes principally the moyno industrial  chemineer and pfaudler product lines 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the more critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time of title passage to our customer which is generally upon shipment of the product 
we recognize revenue for certain longer term contracts based on the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method requires estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method because we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost applicable to various stages of a contract 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that gave rise to the revision become known 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
significant estimates made by us include the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  deferred tax asset valuation allowance  warranty  litigation  product liability  tax contingencies  stock option valuation  goodwill valuation and retirement benefit obligations 
our estimate for uncollectible accounts receivable is based upon an analysis of our prior collection experience  specific customer creditworthiness  current economic trends within the industries we serve  specific customers ability to pay us and the length of time that the receivables are past due 
inventory valuation reserves are determined based on our assessment of the demand for our products and the on hand quantities of inventory in relation to historical usage 
the inventory to which this reserve relates is still on hand and will be sold or disposed of in the future 
the expected selling price of this inventory approximates its net book value  therefore  there is no significant impact on gross margin when it is sold 
we have recorded valuation allowances to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized based upon our analysis of the realization of tax benefits associated with the deferred tax assets 
future taxable income  reversals of temporary differences  available carryback periods  the results of tax strategies and changes in tax laws could impact these estimates 
warranty obligations are contingent upon product failure rates  material required for the repairs and service and delivery costs 
we estimate the warranty accrual based on specific product failures that are known to us plus an additional amount based on the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales 
we record litigation and product liability reserves based upon a case by case analysis of the facts  circumstances and estimated costs 
estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare our consolidated financial statements 
these estimates are subject to change as conditions within and beyond our control change  including but not limited to economic conditions  the availability of additional information and actual experience rates different from those used in our estimates 
accordingly  actual results may differ from these estimates 
acquisition and disposition on january  the acquisition date  we completed our acquisition of t energy services  inc t  such that t became a wholly owned subsidiary of robbins myers  inc the operating results of t are included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date within our fluid management segment 
see note acquisition in item of this report 
the merger was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  business combinations 
accordingly  we made an allocation of the purchase price at the acquisition date based upon our estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities obtained during our due diligence process and through other sources  including through tangible and intangible asset appraisals 
additionally  as required by asc  all integration related costs  including professional fees and severance  were expensed as incurred 
in fiscal  we completed the sale of all the shares and equity interest in our romaco businesses romaco segment 
the results of our romaco segment are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
see note discontinued operations in item of this report 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested on an annual basis  or more frequently as impairment indicators arise 
impairment tests  which involve the use of estimates related to the fair market values of the business operations with which goodwill is associated at our reporting unit level  were performed at year end for fiscal our annual impairment test date using both a market approach  as well as a discounted cash flow methodology income approach 
the market approach determines the value of a reporting unit by deriving market multiples for reporting units based on assumptions potential market participants would use in establishing a bid price for the unit 
this approach therefore assumes strategic initiatives will result in improvements in operational performance in the event of purchase  and includes the application of a discount rate based on market participant assumptions with respect to capital structure and access to capital markets 
the income approach uses a reporting unit s projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that is discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current and future market conditions 
the projection uses management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period  including growth rates in sales  costs  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
our final estimate of fair value of reporting units is developed by a combination of the fair values determined through both the market and income approaches 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
although our market participant assumptions and cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the market environment and plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in applying these assumptions to our valuations 
the impairment testing performed by the company at august  indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount  and  as such  no impairment existed 
our definite lived intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis  with estimated useful lives ranging from under a year to years 
these assets are evaluated periodically and when events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of these definite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable  management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows 
if the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount  we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
we use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair values of these assets including discounted cash flow models  which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use 
losses  if any  resulting from impairment tests for goodwill and definite lived intangible assets would be reflected in income before interest and income taxes in our consolidated statement of income 
foreign currency accounting gains and losses resulting from the settlement of a transaction in a currency different from that used to record the transaction are charged or credited to net income when incurred 
adjustments resulting from the translation of non us dollar functional currency denominated financial statements into us dollars are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the consolidated balance sheet except venezuela  which was reported under highly inflationary accounting rules since our second quarter of fiscal see below 
our company has a venezuelan subsidiary with net sales  operating income and total assets representing approximately one percent of our consolidated financial statement amounts for fiscal  and in early january  the venezuelan government devalued its currency 
our subsidiary operated under a rate of bolivars to the us dollar  as compared with the previous rate of  and our fiscal and fiscal year end financial statements reflected this new rate 
in addition  the financial statements of our venezuelan subsidiary were consolidated and reported under highly inflationary accounting rules under us generally accepted accounting principles beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  with all gains or losses from remeasurement reflected in our consolidated statement of income since the second quarter of fiscal we use permanently invested intercompany loans as a source of capital to reduce the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our foreign subsidiaries 
these loans are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
therefore  we record foreign exchange gains or losses on these intercompany loans in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
pensions we maintain defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans that provide retirement benefits to substantially all us employees and certain non us employees 
pension expense for fiscal and beyond is dependent on a number of factors including returns on plan assets and changes in plan discount rates and therefore cannot be predicted with certainty 
a significant factor in determining the amount of expense recorded for a funded pension plan is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we develop the long term rate of return assumption based on the current mix of equity and debt securities included in plan assets and on the historical returns on those types of investments  judgmentally adjusted to reflect current expectations of future returns 
at august   the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets was 
in addition to the expected rate of return on plan assets  recorded pension expense includes the effects of service cost the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period and interest on the plan s liabilities to participants 
these amounts are determined actuarially based on current discount rates and assumptions regarding matters such as future salary increases and mortality 
differences in actual experience in relation to these assumptions are generally not recognized immediately but rather are deferred together with asset related gains or losses 
when cumulative asset related and liability related gains or losses exceed the greater of of total liabilities or the calculated value of plan assets  the excess is amortized and included in pension income or expense 
at august   the weighted average discount rate used to value plan liabilities was 
we determine our discount rate based on an actuarial yield curve applied to the payments we expect to make out of our defined benefit plans 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
additional changes in the key assumptions discussed above would affect the amount of pension expense currently expected to be recorded for years subsequent to fiscal specifically  a one half percent decrease in the rate of return on assets assumption would have the effect of increasing pension expense by approximately million 
a comparable increase in this assumption would have the opposite effect 
in addition  a one half percent increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense by million  and a comparable decrease in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately million 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements  that amends existing disclosure requirements under asc  by adding required disclosures about items transferring into and out of levels and in the fair value hierarchy  adding separate disclosures about purchase  sales  issuances  and settlements relative to level measurements  and clarifying  among other things  the existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation 
this asu was effective for us in the fourth quarter of fiscal  except for the requirement to provide level activity of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis  which is effective beginning in our fiscal the adoption of this standard that was applicable for fiscal did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations  that addresses diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations 
the amendments in this standard specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior reporting period only 
this standard also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures under asc to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments in this asu are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   with early adoption permitted

in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  that amends the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and disclosing information about fair value measurements

this standard will be effective for us beginning in our third quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income  that addresses the comparability  consistency  and transparency of financial reporting and increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments in this standard require that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
under either method  adjustments must be displayed for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income oci to net income  in both net income and oci 
the standard does not change the current option for presenting components of oci gross or net of the effect of income taxes  provided that such tax effects are presented in the statement in which oci is presented or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements 
additionally  the standard does not affect the calculation or reporting of earnings per share 
for public entities  the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  and are to be applied retrospectively  with early adoption permitted

 testing goodwill for impairment  that gives both public and nonpublic entities the option to qualitatively determine whether they can bypass the existing two step goodwill impairment test under asc under the new standard  if an entity chooses to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that it is more likely than not a more than percent likelihood that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  it would then perform step of the annual goodwill impairment test in asc and  if necessary  proceed to step otherwise  no further evaluation would be necessary 
the decision to perform a qualitative assessment is made at the reporting unit level  and an entity with multiple units may utilize a mix of qualitative assessments and quantitative tests among its reporting units 
this standard is effective for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
this standard will be effective for us beginning in our third quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

the company also operates in venezuela  whose currency in became highly inflationary  as defined by us generally accepted accounting principles  causing us to utilize the us dollar as the functional currency 
sales  operating income and total assets in venezuela represent approximately of our consolidated financial statement amounts 
we manage our exposure to net assets and cash flows in currencies other than us dollars by minimizing our non us dollar net asset positions 
under certain conditions  we may enter into hedging transactions  primarily currency swaps  under established policies and guidelines that enable us to mitigate the potential adverse impact of foreign exchange rate risk 
we do not engage in trading or other speculative activities with these transactions as established policies require that these hedging transactions relate to specific currency exposures 
we currently do not have any such hedging transactions in place 
our main foreign exchange rate exposures relate to assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in british pounds  euros  indian rupees  chinese renminbi and canadian dollars and the general economic exposure that fluctuations in these currencies could have on the us dollar value of future non us cash flows 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on us for fiscal  the net unhedged exposures in each currency were remeasured assuming a decrease in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar 
using this method  our ebit for fiscal would have decreased by million and our cash flow from operations for fiscal would have decreased by million 
this calculation assumed that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  these changes may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales prices as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not include any effects of potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices
