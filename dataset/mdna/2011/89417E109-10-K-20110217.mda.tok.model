after tax interest expense in totaled million  compared with million in asbestos claims and litigation the company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have attempted to expand insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the intent of insurers and policyholders 
while the company has experienced a decrease in new asbestos claims over the past several years  the company continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims from the company policyholders which includes others seeking coverage under a policy  including claims against the company policyholders by individuals who do not appear to be impaired by asbestos exposure 
factors underlying these claim filings include intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the focus by plaintiffs on previously peripheral defendants 
the focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years 
in addition to contributing to the overall number of claims  bankruptcy proceedings may increase the volatility of asbestos related losses by initially delaying the reporting of claims and later by significantly accelerating and increasing loss payments by insurers  including the company 
the bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but that remain in the tort system 
currently  in many jurisdictions  those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts  while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket 
this trend of prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries  along with the focus on previously peripheral defendants  contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payments experienced by the company 
the company asbestos related claims and claim adjustment expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders  whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers 
the company continues to be involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders  some of whom have filed for bankruptcy  who in some instances have asserted that all or a portion of their asbestos related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage 
in these instances  policyholders also may assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated as a separate occurrence under the policy 
it is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues 
to the extent both issues are resolved in a policyholder favor and other company defenses are not successful  the company coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable per occurrence limits and the number of asbestos bodily injury claims against the policyholders 
accordingly  although the company has seen a moderation in the overall risk associated with these lawsuits  it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims 
many coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements 
because many policyholders make exaggerated demands  it is difficult to predict the outcome of 
table of contents settlement negotiations 
settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the company but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than originally anticipated 
there also may be instances where a court may not approve a proposed settlement  which may result in additional litigation and potentially less beneficial outcomes for the company 
as in the past  the company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities 
in addition to claims against policyholders  proceedings have been launched directly against insurers  including the company  by individuals challenging insurers conduct with respect to the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos related bodily injuries 
the company anticipates the filing of other direct actions against insurers  including the company  in the future 
it is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings  including whether the plaintiffs will be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability 
the company believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions 
travelers property casualty corp 
tpc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  had entered into settlement agreements  which are subject to a number of contingencies  in connection with a number of these direct action claims 
these settlement agreements had been approved by the court in connection with proceedings initiated by tpc in the johns manville bankruptcy court 
on march   the us district court for the southern district of new york substantially affirmed the bankruptcy court orders  while vacating that portion of the bankruptcy court orders which required all future direct actions against tpc to first be approved by the bankruptcy court before proceeding in state or federal court 
various parties appealed the district court ruling to the us court of appeals for the second circuit 
on february   the second circuit issued an opinion vacating on jurisdictional grounds the district court approval of the bankruptcy court order that barred the filing of certain direct action claims against tpc in the future 
tpc and certain other parties filed petitions for writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court seeking review of the second circuit decision 
those petitions were granted and on june   the supreme court ruled in favor of the company  reversing the second circuit decision 
however  since the second circuit had not ruled on several additional issues principally related to procedural matters and the adequacy of notice provided to certain parties  the supreme court remanded the case to the second circuit for further proceedings on those specific issues 
on march   the second circuit issued an opinion in which it found that the notice of the orders provided to the remaining objector was insufficient to bar contribution claims by that objector against tpc 
on april   tpc filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc with the second circuit  requesting further review of its march  opinion  which was denied on may  on august   tpc filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court seeking review of the second circuit march  opinion  and a petition for a writ of mandamus seeking an order from the supreme court requiring the second circuit to comply with the supreme court june  ruling in tpc favor

on september   tpc filed an opposition to the plaintiffs motions to compel on the grounds that the conditions precedent to the settlements  principally the requirement that all contribution claims be barred  have not been met in light of the second circuit march  opinion 
on december   the bankruptcy court granted the plaintiffs motions and ruled that tpc was required to fund the settlements

because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues  the company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder at least annually 
among the factors which the company may consider in the course of this review are available insurance coverage  including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder  limits and deductibles  an analysis of the policyholder potential liability  the jurisdictions involved  past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims  past settlement values of similar claims  allocated claim adjustment expense  potential role of other insurance  the role  if any  of non asbestos claims or potential non asbestos claims in any resolution process  and applicable coverage defenses or determinations  if any  including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage  if any  for that claim 
in the third quarter of  the company completed its annual in depth asbestos claim review and noted the continuation of recent trends  which include continued high level of litigation activity involving individuals alleging serious asbestos related illness  stable payment patterns for a large proportion of policyholders  a decrease in the number of large asbestos exposures confronting the company due to additional settlement activity  continued moderate level of asbestos related bankruptcy activity  and the absence of new theories of liability or new classes of defendants 
while the company believes that these trends indicate a reduction in the volatility associated with the company overall asbestos exposure  there nonetheless remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure from asbestos claims 
the company quarterly asbestos reserve review includes an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category  as well as recent settlements  policyholder bankruptcies  judicial rulings and legislative actions 
the company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders in the home office  field office and assumed reinsurance and other categories as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries 
in addition  the company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience  year by year  to assess any emerging trends  fluctuations  or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity 
conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves nor have the company evaluations resulted in any way of determining a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment 
as in prior years  the annual claim review considered active policyholders and litigation cases for potential product and non product liability 
compared with the prior year period  the home office and field office categories  which account for the vast majority of policyholders with active asbestos related claims  experienced an overall reduction in the number of policyholders who  for the first time  were tendering asbestos claims 
however  gross defense and indemnity payment patterns in these categories remained consistent with what the company has experienced in recent years due to the high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos related injury continue to target previously peripheral defendants 
the completion of these reviews and analyses in the third quarter resulted in a net million increase in the company asbestos reserves  driven by increases in the company estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of policyholders  costs of litigating asbestos related coverage matters  and projected payments on assumed reinsurance 
table of contents accounts 
this increase included a million benefit from the reduction in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance resulting from a recent favorable ruling related to a reinsurance dispute and an increase in estimated reinsurance recoverables 
in  the company recorded a million increase in asbestos reserves  primarily driven by a slight increase in the company assumption for projected defense costs related to many policyholders 
the company recorded a million increase to asbestos reserves in  which was driven by a change in the estimated costs associated with litigating asbestos coverage matters and a change in estimated losses for certain individual policyholders

structured settlements are arrangements under which policyholders and or plaintiffs agree to fixed financial amounts to be paid at scheduled times 
included in this category are tpc reserves for the settlements of the statutory and hawaii actions and the common law claims 
for a description of these matters  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
coverage in place arrangements represent agreements with policyholders on specified amounts of coverage to be provided 
payment obligations may be subject to annual maximums and are only made when valid claims are presented 
wellington accounts refer to the defendants that are parties to a agreement settling certain disputes concerning insurance coverage for their asbestos claims 
many of the aspects of the wellington agreement are similar to those of coverage in place arrangements in which the parties have agreed on specific amounts of coverage and the terms under which the coverage can be accessed 
the home office and field office category relates to all other policyholders and also includes unallocated ibnr reserves and reserves for the costs of defending asbestos related coverage litigation 
policyholders are identified for the annual home office review based upon  among other factors a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified threshold currently  perceived level of exposure  number of reported claims  products completed operations and potential non product exposures  size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder 
in addition to ibnr amounts contained in the reserves for home office and field office policyholders and the costs of litigating asbestos coverage matters  the company has established a reserve for further adverse development related to existing policyholders  new claims from policyholders reporting claims for the first time and policyholders for which there is  or may be  litigation and direct actions against the company 
the assumed reinsurance and other category primarily consists of reinsurance of excess coverage  including various pool participations 

table of contents on january   the company and ppg industries  inc ppg  along with approximately other insurers of ppg  agreed in principle to an agreement to settle asbestos related coverage litigation under insurance policies issued to ppg 
the tentative settlement agreement has been incorporated into the modified third amended plan of reorganization amended plan proposed as part of the pittsburgh corning corp

table of contents environmental claims and litigation the company continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged disposition of toxic substances 
mostly  these claims are due to various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation 
for instance  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  enacted in and later modified  enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances 
this federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action 
liability under cercla may be joint and several with other responsible parties 
the company has been  and continues to be  involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims 
the company believes that some court decisions have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders 
these decisions often pertain to insurance policies that were issued by the company prior to the mid s 
these decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
environmental claims when submitted rarely indicate the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the policyholder  and the company does not keep track of the monetary amount being sought in those few claims which indicate a monetary amount 
the resolution of environmental exposures by the company generally occurs by settlement on a policyholder by policyholder basis as opposed to a claim by claim basis 
generally  the company strives to extinguish any obligations it may have under any policy issued to the policyholder for past  present and future environmental liabilities and extinguish any pending coverage litigation dispute with the policyholder 
this form of settlement is commonly referred to as a buy back of policies for future environmental liability 
in addition  many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance obligation which the company may have for other claims  including but not limited to asbestos and other cumulative injury claims 
the company and its policyholders may also agree to settlements which extinguish any liability arising from known specified sites or claims 
where appropriate  these agreements also include indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the company 
the company general purpose in executing these agreements is to reduce the company potential environmental exposure and eliminate the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related costs 
in establishing environmental reserves  the company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution  if any 
in the course of this analysis  the company generally considers the probable liability  available coverage  relevant judicial interpretations and historical value of similar exposures 
in addition  the company considers the many variables presented  such as the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site  the allegations of environmental harm at each site  the number of sites  the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site  the nature of environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site  the nature of government enforcement activities at each site  the ownership and general use of each site  the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the company and the policyholder  including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder  the involvement of other insurers  the potential for other available coverage  including the number of years of coverage  the role  if any  of non environmental claims or potential non environmental claims in any resolution process  and the applicable law in each jurisdiction 
conventional actuarial techniques are not used to estimate these reserves 
in its review of environmental reserves  the company considers past settlement payments  changing judicial and legislative trends  its reserves for the costs of litigating environmental coverage matters  the potential for policyholders with smaller exposures to be named in new clean up actions for 
table of contents both on and off site waste disposal activities  the potential for adverse development  the potential for additional new claims beyond previous expectations  and the potential higher costs for new settlements 
the duration of the company investigation and review of these claims and the extent of time necessary to determine an appropriate estimate  if any  of the value of the claim to the company vary significantly and are dependent upon a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the cooperation of the policyholder in providing claim information  the pace of underlying litigation or claim processes  the pace of coverage litigation between the policyholder and the company and the willingness of the policyholder and the company to negotiate  if appropriate  a resolution of any dispute pertaining to these claims 
because these factors vary from claim to claim and policyholder by policyholder  the company cannot provide a meaningful average of the duration of an environmental claim 
however  based upon the company experience in resolving these claims  the duration may vary from months to several years 
although the company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time  the number of new policyholders submitting those notices declined from these policyholders continue to present smaller exposures  have fewer sites and are lower tier defendants 
further  in many instances clean up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk based site analyses and more efficient clean up technologies 
however  the company has experienced modest upward development in the expected defense and settlement costs for certain of its pending policyholders 
as a result  the company increased its net environmental reserves by million in during  the company experienced an increase in the number of policyholders tendering claims for the first time and in the number of pending environmental related coverage actions 
in addition  the company experienced upward development in the expected defense and settlement costs for certain of its pending policyholders

at december   approximately of the net environmental reserve approximately million was carried in a bulk reserve and included unresolved environmental claims  incurred but not reported environmental claims and the anticipated cost of coverage litigation disputes relating to these claims 
the bulk reserve the company carries is established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in process environmental claims and the company experience in resolving those claims

however  the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue  and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation 
as a result  these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop 
the continuing uncertainties include  without limitation  the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation  any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants  a further increase or decrease in the cost to resolve  and or the number of  asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated  the role of any umbrella or excess policies the company has issued  the resolution or adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with the company previous assessment of these claims  the number and outcome of direct actions against the company  future developments pertaining to the company ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims and the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders  whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers 
in addition  uncertainties arise from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders and other defendants 
it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal  regulatory and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims 
this development will be affected by future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations  including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims  as well as changes in applicable legislation 
it is also difficult 
table of contents to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or  failing settlement  until the dispute is adjudicated 
this is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective 
as part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves  the company continues to study the implications of these and other developments 
also see note to the consolidated financial statements 
because of the uncertainties set forth above  additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current related reserves 
in addition  the company estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change 
these additional liabilities or increases in estimates  or a range of either  cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the company operating results in future periods

both guaranteed and non guaranteed residential cmos allocate the distribution of payments from the underlying mortgages among different classes of bondholders 
in addition  non guaranteed residential cmos provide structures that allocate the impact of credit losses to different classes of bondholders 
senior and super senior cmos are protected  to varying degrees  from credit losses as those losses are initially allocated to subordinated bondholders

catastrophe modeling the company uses various analyses and methods  including computer modeling techniques  to analyze catastrophic events and the risks associated with them 
the company uses these analyses and methods to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic events 
in making underwriting and reinsurance decisions for hurricane and earthquake exposures  the company uses third party proprietary computer modeling in an attempt to estimate the likelihood that the loss from a single event occurring in a one year timeframe will equal or exceed a particular amount 
the tables below set forth the estimated probabilities that losses from a single event occurring in a one year timeframe will equal or exceed the indicated loss amounts expressed in dollars and as a percentage of the company common equity 
for example  on the basis described below the tables  the company estimates that there is a one percent chance that the company loss from a single us hurricane occurring in a one year timeframe would equal or exceed billion  or of the company common equity at december  dollars in billions likelihood of exceedance single us hurricane single us and canadian earthquake in in in in  percentage of common equity likelihood of exceedance single us hurricane single us and canadian earthquake in in in in  an event that has  for example  a likelihood of exceedance is sometimes described as a in year event 
as noted above  however  the probabilities in the table represent the likelihood of losses from a single event equaling or exceeding the indicated threshold 
table of contents loss amount in a one year timeframe  not over a multi year timeframe 
also  because the probabilities relate to a single event  the probabilities do not address the likelihood of more than one event occurring in a particular period  and  therefore  the amounts do not address potential aggregate catastrophe losses occurring in a one year timeframe 
the percentage of common equity is calculated by dividing a indicated loss amounts in dollars by b total common equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses  net of taxes 
net unrealized investment gains and losses can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends 
accordingly  in the opinion of the company management  the percentage of common equity calculated on this basis provides a useful metric for investors to understand the potential impact of a single hurricane or single earthquake on the company financial position 
the threshold loss amounts in the tables above are net of reinsurance  after tax and exclude most loss adjustment expenses  which historically have been less than of loss estimates 
the amounts for hurricanes reflect us exposures and include property exposures  property residual market exposures and an adjustment for certain non property exposures 
the amounts for earthquakes reflect us and canadian exposures and include property exposures and workers compensation exposures 
the company does not believe that the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses arising from other geographical areas or other exposures would materially change the estimated threshold loss amounts 
this information in the tables is based on the company in force portfolio and catastrophic reinsurance program as of december  catastrophe modeling relies upon inputs based on experience  science  engineering and history 
these inputs reflect a significant amount of judgment and are subject to changes which may result in volatility in the modeled output 
catastrophe modeling output may also fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or are otherwise unforeseeable 
catastrophe modeling assumptions include  among others  the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a catastrophic event  which may prove to be materially incorrect 
consequently  catastrophe modeling estimates are subject to significant uncertainty 
in the tables above  the uncertainty associated with the estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of exceedance decreases 
in other words  in the case of a relatively more remote event eg  in  the estimated threshold loss amount is relatively less reliable 
actual losses from an event could materially exceed the indicated threshold loss amount 
in addition  more than one such event could occur in any period 
moreover  the company is exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property and workers compensation coverages arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes  and it is exposed to catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes  such as windstorms  hail  wildfires  severe winter weather  floods  volcanic eruptions and acts of terrorism 
there are no industry standard methodologies or assumptions for projecting catastrophe exposure 
accordingly  catastrophe estimates provided by different insurers may not be comparable 
for more information about the company exposure to catastrophe losses  see item a risk factors catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  our financial position and or liquidity  and could adversely impact our ratings  our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance 
changing climate conditions severe weather events over the last several years have underscored the unpredictability of future climate trends and created uncertainty regarding insurers exposures to financial loss as a result of catastrophe and other weather related events 
some scientists believe that  in recent years  changing 
table of contents climate conditions have added to the unpredictability  frequency and severity of natural disasters 
accordingly  if climate conditions change in the future  the company catastrophe models may be less reliable 
the company discusses how potentially changing climate conditions may present other issues for its business under risk factors in item a of this report and under outlook herein 
for example  among other things increasingly unpredictable and severe weather conditions could result in increased frequency and severity of claims under policies issued by the company 
see risk factors catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  our financial position and or liquidity  and could adversely impact our ratings  our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance and outlook underwriting profitability 
such changing climate conditions could also impact the creditworthiness of issuers of securities in which the company invests 
for example  water supply adequacy could impact the creditworthiness of bond issuers in the southwestern united states  and more frequent and or severe hurricanes could impact the creditworthiness of issuers in the southeastern united states  among other areas 
see risk factors our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material losses 
increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions may impact the company and its customers 
for example  state insurance regulation could impact the company ability to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven losses 
if the company is unable to implement risk based pricing  modify policy terms or reduce exposures to the extent necessary to address rising losses related to catastrophes and smaller scale weather events should those increased losses occur  its business may be adversely affected 
see risk factors catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  our financial position and or liquidity  and could adversely impact our ratings  our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance 
the full range of potential liability exposures related to climate change continues to evolve 
through the company emerging issues committee and its committee on climate  energy and the environment  the company works with its business units and corporate groups as appropriate to identify and try to assess climate change related liability issues  which are continually evolving and often hard to fully evaluate 
see risk factors the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
climate change regulation also could increase the company customers costs of doing business 
for example  insureds faced with carbon management regulatory requirements may have less available capital for investment in loss prevention and safety features which may  over time  increase loss exposures 
also  increased regulation may result in reduced economic activity  which would decrease the amount of insurable assets and businesses 
the company regularly reviews emerging issues  such as changing climate conditions  to consider potential changes to its modeling and the use of such modeling  as well as to help determine the need for new underwriting strategies  coverage modifications or new products 
reinsurance recoverables ceded reinsurance involves credit risk  except with regard to mandatory pools for which liability is mostly joint and several  and is generally subject to aggregate loss limits 
although the reinsurer is liable to the company to the extent of the reinsurance ceded  the company remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured 
reinsurance recoverables are reported after reductions for known insolvencies and after allowances for uncollectible amounts 
the company also holds collateral  
table of contents including trust agreements  escrow funds and letters of credit  under certain reinsurance agreements 
the company monitors the financial condition of reinsurers on an ongoing basis and reviews its reinsurance arrangements periodically 
reinsurers are selected based on their financial condition  business practices and the price of their product offerings 
after reinsurance is purchased  the company has limited ability to manage the credit risk to a reinsurer 
in addition  in a number of jurisdictions  particularly the european union and the united kingdom  a reinsurer is permitted to transfer a reinsurance arrangement to another reinsurer  which may be less creditworthy  without a counterparty consent  provided that the transfer has been approved by the applicable regulatory and or court authority 
the company reinsurance recoverables totaled billion at december   a decline of billion from year end  primarily reflecting cash collections and the impact of net favorable prior year reserve development  partially offset by a reduction in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance resulting from a recent favorable ruling relating to a reinsurance dispute 
the company has also entered into master security agreements with certain reinsurers 
these agreements define conditions that require the reinsurer to provide collateral 
the specific conditions and the amounts and form of collateral to be provided by these agreements vary based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the reinsurers legal structure and trading history with the company 
the following table presents the company top five reinsurer groups by reinsurance recoverable at december  in millions

included in reinsurance recoverables are certain amounts related to structured settlements 
structured settlements comprise annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain personal physical injury claims  of which workers compensation claims comprise a significant portion 
in cases where the company did not receive a release from the claimant  the structured settlement is included in reinsurance recoverables as the company retains the contingent liability to the claimant 
in the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments  the company would be required to make such payments 
in the third quarter of  old mutual plc  the parent of a us life insurance company that is one of the largest issuers of structured settlements included in the company reinsurance recoverables  agreed to sell its us life insurance business to a hedge fund buyer  pending regulatory approval 
the company currently cannot predict the impact of the transaction  if approved  on the long term creditworthiness of the annuity issuer

the company considers these factors in assessing the adequacy of its allowance for uncollectible amounts 
outlook the following discussion provides outlook information for certain key drivers of the company results of operations and capital position 
premiums 
the company earned premiums are a function of net written premium volume 
net written premiums comprise both renewal business and new business and are recognized as earned premium over the life of the underlying policies 
when business renews  the amount of net written premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease renewal premium change as a result of increases or decreases in rate and or insured exposures  which the company considers as a measure of units of exposure 
net written premiums from both renewal and new business  and therefore earned premiums  are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions  which  particularly in the case of the business insurance segment  affect audit premium adjustments  policy endorsements and mid term cancellations 
net written premiums are also impacted by the structure of reinsurance programs and related costs 
the company expects retention levels the amount of expiring premium that renews  before the impact of renewal premium changes will remain strong  generally consistent with recent periods 
in the business insurance segment  the company expects a slightly improving trend in renewal premium changes  including the components of rate changes and insured exposures  during compared with in the financial  professional international insurance segment  the company expects that renewal premium changes  including the components of rate changes and insured exposures  will not meaningfully change during compared with in the personal insurance segment  the company expects that agency automobile renewal premium changes  while positive  will decrease slightly in from levels in for its agency homeowners and other business  the company expects renewal premium changes in will remain generally consistent with the pricing environment for new business generally has less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal rate changes  given the volume of new business relative to renewal business 
while property and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive in for new business  the company believes it is well positioned to capitalize on new business opportunities as agents  brokers and customers seek to place business with high quality carriers 
in addition  the company launched a new distribution channel in that markets personal insurance products directly to consumers  which is expected to generate modest growth in premium volume for personal insurance in 
table of contents while economic conditions have recently improved  there is continued uncertainty regarding the timing and strength of any economic recovery 
the trend may not continue 
further  if growth continues  it may be at a slow rate for an extended period of time 
in addition  other economic conditions  such as the commercial and residential real estate environment and employment rates  may continue to be weak 
if weak economic conditions persist or deteriorate  low levels of economic activity could impact exposure changes at renewal and our ability to write business at acceptable rates 
additionally  such low levels of economic activity could adversely impact audit premium adjustments  policy endorsements and mid term cancellations after policies are written 
all of the foregoing  in turn  could adversely impact net written premiums in since earned premiums lag net written premiums  earned premiums could be adversely impacted in and into underwriting gain loss 
in business insurance  the anticipated impact of competitive market conditions and general economic conditions on the company earned premiums  as discussed above  coupled with an expected modest increase in loss costs  will likely result in modestly reduced underwriting profitability during  as compared with in financial  professional international insurance  the anticipated impact of a decline in earned premiums resulting from lower levels of written premiums in  combined with higher employee and technology related costs to enhance operations and support future business growth  will likely result in modestly reduced underwriting profitability during as compared with in personal insurance  the anticipated impact of continued positive renewal premium changes on the company earned premiums  as discussed above  combined with an expected modest increase in loss costs  will likely result in modestly increased underwriting profitability during  as compared with in personal insurance  the company direct to consumer initiative  discussed above  while intended to enhance the company long term ability to compete successfully in a consumer driven marketplace  is expected to remain unprofitable for a number of years as this book of business grows and matures 
in recent periods  the company has experienced net favorable prior year reserve development  driven by better than expected loss experience in all of the company segments  primarily in accident years through better than expected loss experience and other favorable circumstances may continue at higher  lower or the same levels as compared to recent periods  may not continue or may reverse  causing the company to recognize higher  lower or the same levels of favorable prior year reserve development  no favorable prior year reserve development or unfavorable prior year reserve development in future periods 
in addition  the ongoing review of prior year claim and claim adjustment expense reserves  or other changes in current period circumstances  may result in the company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods 
catastrophe losses are inherently unpredictable from year to year  and the company results of operations would be adversely impacted by significant catastrophe losses in investment portfolio 
the company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on maintaining a high quality investment portfolio and a relatively low average effective duration 
net investment income is a material contributor to the company results of operations 
while interest rates have recently risen above the historic lows experienced in the second half of  the company expects investment returns for its fixed maturity investment portfolio to be slightly lower in than in recent periods due to lower reinvestment yields available for maturing long term fixed maturity investments

capital position 
the company believes it has a strong capital position and expects to continue its common share repurchase program in as part of its continuing efforts to maximize shareholder value 
the company expects the total dollar amount of share repurchases in will exceed its operating income for the year  as it did in  but the total dollar amount of share repurchases is expected to be lower than in the actual amount of share repurchases will depend on a variety of factors  including the company earnings  corporate and regulatory requirements  share price  catastrophe losses  strategic initiatives and other market conditions 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to continue to repurchase shares in excess of its operating income in future years 
the company had a net after tax unrealized investment gain of billion in its fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  while the company does not attempt to predict future interest rate movements  a rising interest rate environment would reduce the market value of fixed maturity investments and  therefore  reduce shareholders equity  and a declining interest rate environment would have the opposite effects

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of a company ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of its business operations 
the liquidity requirements of the company business have been met primarily by funds generated from operations  asset maturities and income received on investments 
cash provided from these sources is used primarily for claims and claim adjustment expense payments and operating expenses  and in recent years  for common share repurchases 
the timing and amount of catastrophe claims are inherently unpredictable 
such claims increase liquidity requirements 
the timing and amount of reinsurance recoveries may be affected by reinsurer solvency and reinsurance coverage disputes 
additionally  the variability of asbestos related claim payments  as well as the volatility of potential judgments and settlements arising out of litigation  may also result in increased liquidity requirements 
it is the opinion of the company management that the company future liquidity needs will be adequately met from all of the above sources 
at december   total cash and short term invested assets aggregating billion and having a weighted average maturity of days were held at the holding company 
the assets held at the holding company are sufficient to meet the holding company current liquidity requirements and are more than three times the company target level 
these liquidity requirements primarily include shareholder dividends and debt service 
the company has a shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission which permits it to issue securities from time to time 
the company also has a billion line of credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in this line of credit also supports the company million commercial paper program  of which million was outstanding at december  the company is not reliant on its commercial paper program to meet its operating cash flow needs 

table of contents the company currently utilizes uncollateralized letters of credit issued by major banks with an aggregate limit of approximately million to provide much of the capital needed to support its obligations at lloyd 
if uncollateralized letters of credit are not available at a reasonable price or at all in the future  the company can collateralize these letters of credit or may have to seek alternative means of supporting its obligations at lloyd  which could include utilizing holding company funds on hand 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
cash flows in reflected a higher level of claims and claim adjustment expense payments due to the impact of loss cost trends and a higher level of catastrophe loss payments  as well as a lower level of reinsurance recoveries  partially offset by declines in the amount of contributions to the company pension plan and lower claims and claim adjustment expense payments related to operations in runoff as compared with cash flows in reflected a decline in catastrophe loss payments  a higher level of reinsurance recoveries  a reduction in the amount of contributions to the company pension plan and lower claims and claim adjustment expense payments related to operations in runoff as compared with those runoff payments in included the company one time net payment of million associated with the final settlement of asbestos claims related to acands  inc in the years ended december   and  the company contributed million  million and million  respectively  to its pension plan 
investing activities net cash flows provided by investing activities totaled billion in  compared with net cash flows used in investing activities of million and million in and  respectively

the primary goals of the company asset liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows 
generally  the expected principal and interest payments produced by the company fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the company insurance reserves 
although this is not an exact cash flow match in each period  the substantial degree by which the market value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the expected present value of the net insurance liabilities  as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds  contributes to the company ability to fund claim payments without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit facilities

on february   the company board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share  payable march  to shareholders of record on march  the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the company common stock will be at the discretion of the company board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including the company financial position  earnings  capital requirements of the company operating subsidiaries  legal requirements  regulatory constraints and other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
dividends would be paid by the company only if declared by its board of directors out of funds legally available  subject to any other restrictions that may be applicable to the company 
share repurchases 
the company board of directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market  pursuant to pre set trading plans meeting the requirements of rule b under the securities exchange act of  in private transactions or otherwise 
the authorizations do not have a stated expiration date 
the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors  including the company financial position  earnings  catastrophe losses  capital requirements of the company operating subsidiaries  legal requirements  regulatory constraints  other investment opportunities including mergers and acquisitions  market conditions and other factors 
the following table summarizes repurchase activity in and remaining repurchase capacity at december  quarterly period ending number of shares purchased cost of shares repurchased average price paid per share remaining capacity under share repurchase authorization march  june  september  december  total in january  the board of directors approved a share repurchase authorization that added an additional billion of repurchase capacity to the billion of capacity remaining at december  
table of contents from the inception of the first authorization in may through december   the company repurchased a cumulative total of million shares for a total cost of billion  or per share 
in  and  the company acquired million  million and million shares  respectively  of common stock from employees as treasury stock primarily to cover payroll withholding taxes related to the vesting of restricted stock awards and exercises of stock options 
capital resources capital resources reflect the overall financial strength of the company and its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet its needs 
the following table summarizes the components of the company capital structure at december  and at december  in millions debt short term long term net unamortized fair value adjustments and debt issuance costs total debt preferred shareholders equity common shareholders equity common stock and retained earnings  less treasury stock accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources total shareholders equity total capitalization the billion decrease in total capitalization from december  primarily reflected the impact of common share repurchases and dividends to shareholders  partially offset by net income in the following table provides a reconciliation of total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains on investments to total capitalization presented in the foregoing table 
at december  dollars in millions total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains on investments net unrealized gain on investments  net of taxes total capitalization debt to total capital ratio debt to total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gains on investments the debt to total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gains on investments is calculated by dividing a debt by b total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments  net of taxes 
net unrealized gains and losses on investments can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends 
accordingly  in the opinion of the company management  the debt to total capital ratio calculated on this basis provides another useful metric for investors to understand the company financial leverage position 
the company debt to total capital ratio of at december  calculated on this basis was within the company target range 

table of contents line of credit agreement 
on june   the company entered into a three year  billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions  replacing its five year  billion credit agreement that expired on that date 
pursuant to the credit agreement covenants  the company must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth generally defined as shareholders equity plus certain trust preferred and mandatorily convertible securities  reduced for goodwill and other intangible assets of billion 
the company must also maintain a ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt plus consolidated net worth of not greater than to 
in addition  the credit agreement contains other customary restrictive covenants as well as certain customary events of default  including with respect to a change in control  which is defined to include the acquisition of or more of the company voting stock and certain changes in the composition of the company board of directors 
at december   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
generally  the cost of borrowing under this agreement will range from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points depending on the company credit ratings 
at december   that cost would have been libor plus basis points had there been any amounts outstanding under the credit agreement 
this line of credit also supports the company commercial paper program 
shelf registration 
in december  the company filed with the securities and exchange commission a universal shelf registration statement for the potential offering and sale of securities 
the company may offer these securities from time to time at prices and on other terms to be determined at the time of offering 
during and  the company issued securities with a principal amount of billion and million  respectively  under the shelf registration statement 
share repurchase authorization 
at december   the company had billion of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorization approved by the board of directors 
in january  the board of directors approved a share repurchase authorization that added an additional billion of repurchase capacity to the billion of capacity that remained at december  contractual obligations the following table summarizes  as of december   the company future payments under contractual obligations and estimated claims and claim related payments 
the table excludes short term obligations and includes only liabilities at december  that are expected to be settled in cash 
the table below includes the amount and estimated future timing of claims and claim related payments 
the amounts do not represent the exact liability  but instead represent estimates  generally utilizing actuarial projections techniques  at a given accounting date 
these estimates include expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on the company assessment of facts and circumstances then known  review of historical settlement patterns  estimates of trends in claims severity  frequency  legal theories of liability and other factors 
variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events  such as changes in claims handling procedures  economic inflation or deflation  legal trends and legislative changes 
many of these items are not directly quantifiable  particularly on a prospective basis 
additionally  there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the policyholder event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer 
the future cash flows related to the items contained in the table below required estimation of both amount including severity considerations and timing 
amount and timing are frequently estimated separately 
an estimation of both amount and timing of future cash flows related to claims and claim related payments is generally reliable only in the aggregate with some unavoidable estimation uncertainty

the amounts in claims and claim adjustment expenses in the table above represent the estimated timing of future payments for both reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses  gross of reinsurance recoverables  excluding structured settlements expected to be paid by annuity companies 
the company has entered into reinsurance agreements to protect itself from potential losses in excess of the amount it is prepared to accept as described in note of notes to the company consolidated financial statements 
in order to qualify for reinsurance accounting  a reinsurance agreement must indemnify the insurer from insurance risk  ie  the agreement must transfer amount and timing risk 
since the timing and amount of cash inflows from such reinsurance agreements are directly related to the underlying payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses by the insurer  reinsurance recoverables are recognized in a manner consistent with the liabilities the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses relating to the underlying reinsured contracts 
the presence of any feature that can delay timely reimbursement of claims by a reinsurer results in the reinsurance contract being accounted for as a deposit rather than reinsurance see below 
the assumptions used in estimating the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoverables are consistent with those used in estimating the amount and timing of the related liabilities 
reinsurance agreements that do not transfer both amount and timing risk are accounted for as deposits and included in reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits in the table above 
the estimated future cash inflows from the company reinsurance contracts that qualify for reinsurance accounting are as follows in millions total less than year years years after years reinsurance recoverables the company manages its business and evaluates its liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expense on a net of reinsurance basis 
the estimated cash flows on a net of reinsurance basis are as follows in millions total less than year years years after years claims and claim adjustment expenses  net for business underwritten by non us operations  future cash flows related to reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses were translated at the spot rate on december  the amounts reported in the table above and in the table of reinsurance recoverables above are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money 
accordingly  the amounts above will differ from the company balance sheet to the extent that the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses and the related reinsurance recoverables have been discounted in the balance sheet 
see note of notes to the company consolidated financial statements 
workers compensation large deductible policies provide third party coverage in which the company typically is responsible for paying the entire loss under such policies and then seeks reimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount 
claims from large deductible policies represent the estimated future payment for claims and claim related expenses below the 
table of contents deductible amount  net of the estimated recovery of the deductible 
the liability and the related deductible receivable for unpaid claims are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as contractholder payables and contractholder receivables  respectively 
most deductibles for such policies are paid directly from the policyholder escrow which is periodically replenished by the policyholder 
the payment of the loss amounts above the deductible are reported within claims and claim adjustment expenses in the above table 
because the timing of the collection of the deductible contractholder receivables occurs shortly after the payment of the deductible to a claimant contractholder payables  these cash flows offset each other in the table 
the estimated timing of the payment of the contractholder payables and the collection of contractholder receivables for workers compensation policies is presented below in millions total less than year years years after years contractholder payables receivables the amounts in loss based assessments relate to estimated future payments of second injury fund assessments which would result from payment of current claim liabilities 
second injury funds cover the cost of any additional benefits for aggravation of a pre existing condition 
for loss based assessments  the cost is shared by the insurance industry and self insureds  funded through assessments to insurance companies and self insureds based on losses 
amounts relating to second injury fund assessments are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the amounts in reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits represent estimated future nominal payments for reinsurance agreements that are accounted for as deposits 
amounts payable under deposit agreements are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the amounts reported in the table are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money 
accordingly  the amounts above will differ from the company balance sheet to the extent that deposit values in the balance sheet have been discounted using deposit accounting 
the amounts in payout from ceded funds withheld represent estimated payments for losses and return of funds held related to certain reinsurance arrangements whereby the company holds a portion of the premium due to the reinsurer and is allowed to pay claims from the amounts held 
the company current liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are billion 
offsetting these liabilities are deferred tax assets of billion associated with the temporary differences that would exist if these positions become realized 
the above table does not include an analysis of liabilities reported for structured settlements for which the company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of default by the company issuing the annuity 
the company is not reasonably likely to incur material future payment obligations under such agreements 
in addition  the company does not have a best estimate of contributions expected to be paid to its qualified pension plan 
accordingly  any future contributions are not included in the foregoing table

malucelli  a transaction that is described in more detail in note of notes to the company consolidated financial statements 
the purchase price for this acquisition will be r million brazilian reais the us dollar equivalent of which will depend on the exchange rate at closing plus an amount based on a brazilian inter bank lending rate cdi from january  through the closing date of the transaction 
at december   r million brazilian reais was equivalent to approximately million in us dollars 
the purchase price is expected to be paid in cash from internal sources in the first half of in order to reduce its exposure to a significant strengthening 
table of contents of the brazilian reais prior to the closing of the transaction  the company entered into a foreign currency option contract on february  in the notional amount of r million which expires on march  the joint venture transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to be finalized in the first half of dividend availability the company principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the state of connecticut 
the insurance holding company laws of connecticut applicable to the company subsidiaries requires notice to  and approval by  the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend that  together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of of the insurer capital and surplus as of the preceding december  or the insurer net income for the twelve month period ending the preceding december  in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices and by state regulation 
this declaration or payment is further limited by adjusted unassigned surplus  as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
the insurance holding company laws of other states in which the company subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar  although in some instances somewhat more restrictive  limitations on the payment of dividends 
a maximum of billion is available by the end of for such dividends without prior approval of the connecticut insurance department 
the company may choose to accelerate the timing within and or increase the amount of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in  which could result in certain dividends being subject to approval by the connecticut insurance department 
the holding company received billion of dividends from its domestic insurance subsidiaries in  including billion of dividends that were subject to regulatory approval  primarily due to the company request for the accelerated timing of payment 
risk based capital the naic adopted rbc requirements for property casualty companies to be used as minimum capital requirements by the naic and states to identify companies that merit further regulatory action 
the formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with levels of capital higher than rbc requirements 
therefore  it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies 
at december   all of the company insurance subsidiaries had adjusted capital in excess of amounts requiring any company or regulatory action 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees related to letters of credit  issuance of debt securities  certain investments  third party loans related to certain investments and various indemnifications  including those related to the sale of business entities

critical accounting estimates the company considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and related reinsurance recoverables  investment valuation and impairments  and goodwill impairments 

table of contents claims and claim adjustment expense reserves claims and claim adjustment expense reserves loss reserves represent management estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability  but instead represent management estimates  generally utilizing actuarial expertise and projection techniques  at a given accounting date 
these loss reserve estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost upon final resolution in the future  based on the company assessment of facts and circumstances then known  review of historical settlement patterns  estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency  expected interpretations of legal theories of liability and other factors 
in establishing loss reserves  the company also takes into account estimated recoveries from reinsurance  salvage and subrogation 
the loss reserves are reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the company 
the process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables 
these variables can be affected by both internal and external events  such as changes in claims handling procedures  changes in individuals involved in the reserve estimation process  economic inflation  legal trends and legislative changes  among others 
the impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate 
loss reserve estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in claim complexity  the volume of claims  the potential severity of individual claims  the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer 
informed judgment is applied throughout the process  including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses 
the company continually refines its loss reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled 
the company rigorously attempts to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time loss reserves are established 
due to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates including  but not limited to  the future settlement environment  final resolution of the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses may be higher or lower than the related loss reserves at the reporting date 
therefore  actual paid losses  as claims are settled in the future  may be materially different in amount than current loss reserves favorable or unfavorable 
because establishment of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates  currently established loss reserves may change 
the company reflects adjustments to loss reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed 
there are also additional risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes 
for example  the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes and other catastrophic events can be affected by the inability of the company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas  the complexity of factors contributing to the losses  the legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves 
complex factors include  but are not limited to determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind  evaluating general liability and pollution exposures  estimating additional living expenses  estimating the impact of demand surge  infrastructure disruption  fraud  the effect of mold damage and business interruption costs  and reinsurance collectibility 
the timing of a catastrophe  such as at or near the end of a reporting period  can also affect the information available to the company in estimating reserves for that reporting period 
the estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge 
a portion of the company gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves totaling billion at december  are for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation 
while the ongoing review of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage  plaintiffs expanded theories of liability and the risks 
table of contents inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties  in the opinion of the company management  it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current reserves by an amount that could be material to the company future operating results 
see the preceding discussion of asbestos claims and litigation and environmental claims and litigation 
gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves by product line were as follows at december  in millions case ibnr total case ibnr total general liability property commercial multi peril commercial automobile workers compensation fidelity and surety personal automobile homeowners and personal other international and other property casualty accident and health claims and claim adjustment expense reserves the billion decline in gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves since december  primarily reflected the impact of net favorable prior year reserve development and payments related to asbestos and environmental claims as well as operations in runoff 
asbestos and environmental reserves are included in the general liability  commercial multi peril and international and other lines in the foregoing summary table 
asbestos and environmental reserves are discussed separately  see asbestos claims and litigation  environmental claims and litigation and uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves 
general discussion the process for estimating the liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses begins with the collection and analysis of claim data 
data on individual reported claims  both current and historical  including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates  are grouped by common characteristics components and evaluated by actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities by product line 
such data is occasionally supplemented with external data as available and when appropriate 
the process of analyzing reserves for a component is undertaken on a regular basis  generally quarterly  in light of continually updated information 
multiple estimation methods are available for the analysis of ultimate claim liabilities 
each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and disadvantages  with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components 
the relative strengths and weaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time 
therefore  the actual choice of estimation method s can change with each evaluation 
the estimation method s chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated 

table of contents in most cases  multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated 
this will result in a range of reasonable estimates for any particular claim liability 
the company uses such range analyses to back test whether previously established estimates for reserves at the reporting segments are reasonable  given subsequent information 
reported values found to be closer to the endpoints of a range of reasonable estimates are subject to further detailed reviews 
these reviews may substantiate the validity of management recorded estimate or lead to a change in the reported estimate 
the exact boundary points of these ranges are more qualitative than quantitative in nature  as no clear line of demarcation exists to determine when the set of underlying assumptions for an estimation method switches from being reasonable to unreasonable 
as a result  the company does not believe that the endpoints of these ranges are or would be comparable across companies 
in addition  potential interactions among the different estimation assumptions for different product lines make the aggregation of individual ranges a highly judgmental and inexact process 
property casualty insurance policies are either written on a claims made or on an occurrence basis 
claims made policies generally cover  subject to requirements in individual policies  claims reported during the policy period 
policies that are written on an occurrence basis require that the insured demonstrate that a loss occurred in the policy period  even if the insured reports the loss many years later 
most general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis 
these policies are subject to substantial loss development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years following the policy issuance 
the occurrence form  which accounts for much of the reserve development in asbestos and environmental exposures  is also used to provide coverage for construction general liability  including construction defect 
occurrence based forms of insurance for general liability exposures require substantial projection of various trends  including future inflation and judicial interpretations and societal litigation dynamics  among others 
a basic premise in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future  absent a material change in the associated risk factors discussed below 
to the extent a material change affecting the ultimate claim liability is known  such change is quantified to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company data and  if available and when appropriate  external data 
such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the particular claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated 
significant structural changes to the available data  product mix or organization can materially impact the reserve estimation process 
informed judgment is applied throughout the reserving process 
this includes the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses 
in addition to actuaries  experts involved with the reserving process also include underwriting and claims personnel and lawyers  as well as other company management 
therefore  management may have to consider varying individual viewpoints as part of its estimation of loss reserves 
it is also likely that during periods of significant change  such as a merger  consistent application of informed judgment becomes even more complicated and difficult 
the variables discussed above in this general discussion have different impacts on reserve estimation uncertainty for a given product line  depending on the length of the claim tail  the reporting lag  the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line 
product lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail  based on the average length of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final resolution of those claims 
short tail claims are reported and settled quickly  resulting in less estimation variability 
the longer the time before final claim resolution  the greater the exposure to estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty 

table of contents a major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag 
the reporting lag  which is the time between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer  makes estimating ibnr inherently more uncertain 
in addition  the greater the reporting lag  the greater the proportion of ibnr to the total claim liability for the product line 
writing new products with material reporting lags can result in adding several years worth of ibnr claim exposure before the reporting lag exposure becomes clearly observable  thereby increasing the risk associated with pricing and reserving such products 
the most extreme example of claim liabilities with long reporting lags are asbestos claims 
for some lines  the impact of large individual claims can be material to the analysis 
these lines are generally referred to as being low frequency high severity  while lines without this large claim sensitivity are referred to as high frequency low severity 
estimates of claim liabilities for low frequency high severity lines can be sensitive to the impact of a small number of potentially large claims 
as a result  the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates 
in contrast  for high frequency low severity lines the impact of individual claims is relatively minor and the range of reasonable reserve estimates is narrower and more stable 
claim complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of assumptions needed to produce the estimate  the potential stability of the underlying data and claim process  and the ability to gain an understanding of the data 
product lines with greater claim complexity  such as for certain surety and construction exposures  have inherently greater estimation uncertainty 
actuaries have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors in their analysis of reserves 
the human element in the application of actuarial judgment is unavoidable when faced with material uncertainty 
different actuaries may choose different assumptions when faced with such uncertainty  based on their individual backgrounds  professional experiences and areas of focus 
hence  the estimates selected by the various actuaries may differ materially from each other 
lastly  significant structural changes to the available data  product mix or organization can also materially impact the reserve estimation process 
events such as mergers increase the inherent uncertainty of reserve estimates for a period of time  until stable trends re establish themselves within the new organization 
risk factors the major causes of material uncertainty risk factors generally will vary for each product line  as well as for each separately analyzed component of the product line 
in a few cases  such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method  but in most cases  they are implicit 
for example  a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year  but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged 
actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions  causing actual paid losses  as claims are settled in the future  to be different in amount than the reserves being estimated currently 
some risk factors will affect more than one product line 
examples include changes in claim department practices  changes in settlement patterns  regulatory and legislative actions  court actions  timeliness of claim reporting  state mix of claimants and degree of claimant fraud 
the extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a product line 
individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product line components 
the effect of a particular risk factor on estimates of claim liabilities cannot be isolated in most cases 
for example  estimates of potential claim settlements may be impacted by the risk associated with potential court rulings  but the final settlement agreement typically does not delineate how much of the settled amount is due to this and other factors 

table of contents the evaluation of data is also subject to distortion from extreme events or structural shifts  sometimes in unanticipated ways 
for example  the timing of claims payments in one geographic region will be impacted if claim adjusters are temporarily reassigned from that region to help settle catastrophe claims in another region 
while some changes in the claim environment are sudden in nature such as a new court ruling affecting the interpretation of all contracts in that jurisdiction  others are more evolutionary 
evolutionary changes can occur when multiple factors affect final claim values  with the uncertainty surrounding each factor being resolved separately  in stepwise fashion 
the final impact is not known until all steps have occurred 
sudden changes generally cause a one time shift in claim liability estimates  although there may be some lag in reliable quantification of their impact 
evolutionary changes generally cause a series of shifts in claim liability estimates  as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and estimable 
actuarial methods for analyzing and estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves the principal estimation and analysis methods utilized by the company actuaries are the paid development method  the case incurred development method  the bornhuetter ferguson bf method  and average value analysis combined with the reported claim development method 
the bf method is usually utilized for more recent accident periods  with a transition to other methods as the underlying claim data becomes more voluminous and therefore more credible 
these are typically referred to as traditional actuarial methods 
see glossary for an explanation of these methods 
while these are the principal methods utilized throughout the company  actuaries evaluating a particular component for a product line have available to them the full range of methods developed within the casualty actuarial profession 
the company actuaries are also continually monitoring developments within the profession for advances in existing techniques or the creation of new techniques that might improve current and future estimates 
some components of product line reserves are susceptible to relatively infrequent large claims that can materially impact the total estimate for that component 
in such cases  the company actuarial analysis generally isolates and analyzes separately such large claims 
the reserves excluding such large claims are generally analyzed using the traditional methods described above 
the reserves associated with large claims are then analyzed utilizing various methods  such as estimating the number of large claims and their average values based on historical trends from prior accident periods  adjusted for the current environment and supplemented with actual data for the accident year analyzed to the extent available 
utilizing individual claim adjuster estimates of the large claims  combined with continual monitoring of the aggregate accuracy of such claim adjuster estimates 
this monitoring may lead to supplemental adjustments to the aggregate of such claim estimates 
utilizing historic longer term average ratios of large claims to small claims  and applying such ratios to the estimated ultimate small claims from traditional analysis 
ground up analysis of the underlying exposure typically used for asbestos and environmental 
the results of such methodologies are subjected to various reasonability and diagnostic tests  including paid to incurred loss ratios  implied incurred loss to earned premium ratios and non zero claim severity trends 
an actual versus expected analysis is also performed comparing actual loss development to expected development based on the prior review 
additional analyses may be performed based on the results of these diagnostics  including the investigation of other actuarial methods 

table of contents the methods described above are generally utilized to evaluate management existing estimate for prior accident periods 
for the initial estimate of the current accident year  the available claim data is typically insufficient to produce a reliable indication 
hence  the initial estimate for an accident year is generally based on a loss ratio projection method  which uses the earned premium for the current year multiplied by a projected loss ratio 
the projected loss ratio is determined through an analysis of prior periods experience  using loss trend  rate level differences  mix of business changes and other known or observed factors influencing the current accident year relative to prior accident years 
the exact number of prior accident years utilized varies by product line component  based on the volume of business for that component and the reliability of an individual accident year estimate 
management estimates at least once per quarter  certain company management meets with its actuaries to review the latest claims and claim adjustment expense reserve analyses 
based on these analyses  management determines whether its ultimate claim liability estimates should be changed 
in doing so  it must evaluate whether the new data provided represents credible actionable information or an anomaly that will have no effect on estimated ultimate claim liability 
for example  as described above  payments may have decreased in one geographic region due to fewer claim adjusters being available to process claims 
the resulting claim payment patterns would be analyzed to determine whether or not the change in payment pattern represents a change in ultimate claim liability 
such an assessment requires considerable judgment 
it is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until sometime after the event 
even if a change is determined to be permanent  it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until sometime later 
the overall detailed analyses supporting such an effort can take several months to perform 
this is because the underlying causes of the trends observed need to be evaluated  which may require the gathering or assembling of data not previously available 
it may also include interviews with experts involved with the underlying processes 
as a result  there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the company estimated claim liabilities 
the final estimate selected by management in a reporting period is based on these various detailed analyses of past data  adjusted to reflect any new actionable information 
the audit committee of the board of directors is responsible for providing oversight of reserving propriety  and annually reviews the process by which the company establishes reserves 
discussion of product lines the following section details reserving considerations and common risk factors by product line 
there are many additional risk factors that may impact ultimate claim costs 
each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required reserves 
also  risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves 
for example  in workers compensation  the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster  thereby lowering indemnity costs 
thus  in almost all cases  it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single risk factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation 
in order to provide information on reasonably possible reserving changes by product line  the historical changes in year end loss reserves over a one year period are provided for the us product lines 
this information is provided for both the company and the industry for the nine most recent years  and is based on the most recent publicly available data for the reported line s that most closely match the individual product line being discussed 
these changes were calculated  net of reinsurance  from statutory annual statement data found in schedule p of those statements  and represent the reported reserve development on the beginning of the year claim liabilities divided by the beginning claim liabilities  all accident years combined  excluding non defense related claim adjustment expense 

table of contents data presented for the company includes history for the entire travelers group us companies only  whether or not the individual subsidiaries were originally part of spc or tpc 
this treatment is required by the statutory reporting instructions promulgated by state regulatory authorities for schedule p 
comparable data for non us companies is not available 
general liability general liability is generally considered a long tail line  as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims from a given accident year 
the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided  the jurisdiction and specific policy provisions such as self insured retentions 
there are numerous components underlying the general liability product line 
some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within to years  while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims eg  a reporting lag of a decade or more for construction defect claims 
while the majority of general liability coverages are written on an occurrence basis  certain general liability coverages such as those covering directors and officers or professional liability are typically insured on a claims made basis 
general liability reserves are generally analyzed as two components primary and excess umbrella  with the primary component generally analyzed separately for bodily injury and property damage 
bodily injury liability payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholder legal obligation arising from non intentional acts such as negligence  subject to the insurance policy provisions 
in some cases the damages can include future wage loss which is a function of future earnings power and wage inflation and future medical treatment costs 
property damage liability payments result from damages to the claimant private property arising from the policyholder legal obligation for non intentional acts 
in most cases  property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date  or soon thereafter 
in addition  sizable or unique exposures are reviewed separately 
these exposures include asbestos  environmental  other mass torts  construction defect  medical malpractice and large unique accounts that would otherwise distort the analysis 
these unique categories often require a very high degree of judgment and require reserve analyses that do not rely on traditional actuarial methods 
defense costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant  sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims 
for some products this risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs erodes the amount of policy limit available to pay the claim 
such defense within the limits policies are most common for claims made products 
when defense costs are outside of the limits  amounts paid for defense costs do not erode the policy limits 
this line is typically the largest source of reserve estimate uncertainty in the united states excluding assumed reinsurance contracts covering the same risk 
major contributors to this reserve estimate uncertainty include the reporting lag ie  the length of time between the event triggering coverage and the actual reporting of the claim  the number of parties involved in the underlying tort action  whether the event triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods  the potential dollars involved in the individual claim actions  whether such claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written ie  coverage dispute potential  and the potential for mass claim actions 
claims with longer reporting lags result in greater inherent risk 
this is especially true for alleged claims with a latency feature  particularly where courts have ruled that coverage is spread over multiple policy years  hence involving multiple defendants and their insurers and reinsurers and multiple policies thereby increasing the potential dollars involved and the underlying settlement complexity 
claims with long latencies also 
table of contents increase the potential recognition lag ie  the lag between writing a type of policy in a certain market and the recognition that such policies have potential mass tort and or latent claim exposure 
the amount of reserve estimate uncertainty also varies significantly by component for the general liability product line 
the components in this product line with the longest latency  longest reporting lags  largest potential dollars involved and greatest claim settlement complexity are asbestos and environmental 
components that include latency  reporting lag and or complexity issues  but to a materially lesser extent than asbestos and environmental  include construction defect  medical malpractice and other mass tort actions 
many components of general liability are not subject to material latency or claim complexity risks and hence have materially less uncertainty than the previously mentioned components 
in general  policies providing coverage with shorter reporting lags  fewer parties involved in settlement negotiations  only one policy potentially triggered per claim  fewer potential settlement dollars  reasonably foreseeable and stable potential hazards claims and no mass tort potential result in much less reserve estimate uncertainty than policies without those characteristics 
in addition to the traditional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion section  the company utilizes various report year development and s curve methods for the construction defect components of this product line 
the construction defect report year development analysis is supplemented with projected claim counts and average values for ibnr claim counts 
for components with greater lags in claim reporting  such as excess and umbrella components of this product line  the company relies more heavily on the bf method than on the paid and case incurred development methods

the company change in reserve estimate for this product line  excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts  was for  for and for the change was primarily concentrated in excess coverages for accident years and prior and reflected what the company believes are favorable legal and judicial environments 
the and changes were driven by several factors  including improved legal and judicial environments  as well as enhanced risk control  underwriting and claim process initiatives 
property property is generally considered a short tail line with a simpler and faster claim reporting and adjustment process than liability coverages  and less uncertainty in the reserve setting process except for more complex business interruption claims 
it is generally viewed as a moderate frequency  low to moderate severity line  except for catastrophes and coverage related to large properties 
the claim reporting and settlement process for property coverage claim reserves is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer 
overall  the claim liabilities for this line create a low estimation risk  except possibly for catastrophes and business interruption claims 
property reserves are typically analyzed in two components  one for catastrophic or other large single events  and another for all other events

property reserves represent approximately of the company total loss reserves 
since property is considered a short tail coverage  the one year change for property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines 
this is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for property relates to the most recent accident year  which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines 
this recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property because of weather related events which  notwithstanding experience  tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year  and generally are not completely resolved until the following year 
reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve 
the reserve estimates for this product line are also potentially subject to material changes due to uncertainty in measuring ultimate losses for unprecedented significant catastrophes such as the events of september  and hurricane katrina

commercial multi peril commercial multi peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small businesses and  therefore  includes both short and long tail coverages 
for property coverage  it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims  while for the other coverages  generally for the liability coverages  it takes a longer period of time to close claims 
the reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product  except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or large single losses 
the reserving risk for this line differs from that of the general liability product line and the property product line due to the nature of the customer 
commercial multi peril is generally sold to smaller sized accounts  while the customer profile for general liability and property includes larger customers

workers compensation workers compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage  as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year 
while certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly  some other payments are made over the course of several years  such as awards for permanent partial injuries 
in addition  some payments can run as long as the injured worker life  such as permanent disability benefits and on going medical care 
despite the possibility of long payment tails  the reporting lags are generally short  settlements are generally not complex  and most of the liability can be considered high frequency with moderate severity 
the largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency  high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a worker injury 
overall  the claim liabilities for this line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk 
workers compensation reserves are typically analyzed in three components indemnity losses  medical losses and claim adjustment expenses

the company change in reserve estimate for this product line was in  in and for fidelity and surety fidelity is generally considered a short tail coverage 
it takes a relatively short period of time to finalize and settle fidelity claims 
the volatility of fidelity reserves is generally related to the type of business of the insured  the size and complexity of the insured business operations  amount of policy limit and attachment point of coverage 
the uncertainty surrounding reserves for small  commercial insureds is typically less than the uncertainty for large commercial or financial institutions 
the high frequency  low severity nature of small commercial fidelity losses provides for stability in loss estimates whereas  the low frequency  high severity nature of losses for large insureds results in a wider range of ultimate loss outcomes 
actuarial techniques that rely on a stable pattern of loss development are generally not applicable to low frequency  high severity policies 
surety has certain components that are generally considered short tail coverages with short reporting lags  although large individual construction and commercial surety contracts can result in a long settlement tail  based on the length and complexity of the construction project or commercial transaction being insured 
large construction projects can take many years to complete 
the frequency of losses in surety correlates with economic cycles as the primary cause of surety loss is the inability of the company insureds to perform financially 
the volatility of surety losses is generally related to the type of business performed by the insured  the type of bonded obligation  the amount of limit exposed to loss and the amount of assets available to the insurer to mitigate losses  such as unbilled contract funds  collateral  first and third party indemnity  and other security positions of an

homeowners and personal lines other homeowners is generally considered a short tail coverage 
most payments are related to the property portion of the policy  where the claim reporting and settlement process is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer 
claims on property coverage are typically reported soon after the actual damage occurs  although delays of several months are not unusual 
the claim is settled when the two parties agree on the amount due in accordance with the policy contract language and the appropriate payment is made or alternatively  the property replacement repair is performed by the insurer 
the resulting settlement process is typically fairly short term  although exceptions do exist 
the liability portion of the homeowners policy generates claims which take longer to pay due to the involvement of litigation and negotiation  but with generally small reporting lags 
in addition  reserves related to umbrella coverages have greater uncertainty since umbrella liability payments are often made far into the future 
overall  the line is generally high frequency  low to moderate severity except for catastrophes  with simple to moderate claim complexity 
homeowners reserves are typically analyzed in two components non catastrophe related losses and catastrophe loss payments 
examples of common risk factors  or perceptions thereof  that could change and  thus  affect the required homeowners reserves beyond those included in the general discussion section include non catastrophe risk factors salvage opportunities amount of time to return property to residential use changes in weather patterns local building codes litigation trends trends in jury awards catastrophe risk factors physical concentration of policyholders availability and cost of local contractors local building codes quality of construction of damaged homes amount of time to return property to residential use for the more severe catastrophic events  demand surge inflation  which refers to significant short term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services homeowners book of business risk factors policy provisions mix eg  deductibles  policy limits  endorsements  etc 
degree of concentration of policyholders changes in underwriting standards changes in the use of credit data for rating and underwriting unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves 
as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for homeowners and personal lines other  a

historically  the one year change in the reserve estimate for this product line excluding the umbrella line of business  which for statutory reporting purposes is included with the general liability line of business over the last nine years has varied from to averaging for the company  and from to averaging for the industry overall 
the company year to year changes are driven by  and are based on  observed events during the year 
the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one year changes in reserve estimates for this product line 
homeowners and personal lines other reserves represent approximately of the company total loss reserves 
this line combines both liability and property coverages  however  the majority of the reserves relate to property 
while property is considered a short tail coverage  the one year change for property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines 
this is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for property relates to the most recent accident year  which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines 
this recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property because of weather related events which tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year  and generally are not completely resolved until the following year 
reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve 
the company change in reserve estimate for this product line excluding the umbrella line of business was for  for and for the company change in reserve estimate for this product line including the umbrella line of business was for  for and for the change reflected favorable loss development in the and prior accident years  primarily for the umbrella line of business  partially offset by unfavorable loss development in the accident year for the homeowners line of business that was driven by higher than anticipated late reported claims related to storms in the change primarily reflected favorable loss development related to hurricanes ike and katrina  as well as the california wildfires 
the change was primarily driven by favorable loss development related to hurricane katrina  by claim initiatives  by better than expected outcomes on catastrophe related claims and by improvements in older accident years for the umbrella line 
international and other international and other includes products written by international and other products not discussed above 
the principal component of other claim reserves is assumed reinsurance written on an excess of loss basis  which may include reinsurance of non us exposures  and is runoff business 
international and other claim liabilities result from a mix of coverages  currencies and jurisdictions countries 
the common characteristic is the need to customize the analysis to the individual component  and the inability to rely on data characterizations and reporting requirements in the us statutory reporting framework 
due to changes in the business mix for this line over time  the recently incurred claim liabilities are relatively short term due to both the products and the jurisdictions involved  eg  the republic of ireland and the united kingdom  while the older liabilities include some from runoff operations that are extremely long tail eg  eg excess liabilities reinsured through the london market  and several underwriting pools in runoff 
the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided  the jurisdiction  the distribution system eg  underwriting pool versus direct and the proximity of the insurance sale to the insured hazard eg  insured and insurer located in different countries 
in particular  liabilities arising from the underwriting pools in runoff may result in significant reporting lags  settlement lags and claim complexity  due to the need to coordinate with other pool members or co insurers through a broker or lead insurer for claim settlement purposes 

table of contents international and other reserves are generally analyzed by program pool  country and general coverage category eg  eg liability excess of loss reinsurance  or general liability municipalities by country 
the business is also generally split by direct versus assumed reinsurance for a given coverage jurisdiction 
where the underlying insured hazard is outside the united states  the underlying coverages are generally similar to those described under the general liability and automobile discussion above  but under a different legal system 
where the underlying hazard is within the us  the coverage involved is typically that of general liability  but on an excess or excess of loss reinsurance basis 
excess exposure requires the insured to prove not only claims under the policy  but also the prior payment of claims reaching up to the excess policy attachment point 
examples of common risk factors  or perceptions thereof  that could change and  thus  affect the required international and other reserves beyond those included in the general discussion section include international and other risk factors changes in claim handling procedures  including those of the primary carriers changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provision new theories of liability trends in jury awards changes in the propensity to sue changes in statutes of limitations changes in the underlying court system distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues changes in tort law changes in claim adjuster office structure causing distortions in the data international and other book of business risk factors changes in policy provisions eg  deductibles  policy limits  endorsements  claims made language changes in underwriting standards product mix eg  size of account  industries insured  jurisdiction mix unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves 
as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for international and other excluding asbestos and environmental  a increase decrease in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a increase decrease in loss reserves 
international and other reserves excluding asbestos and environmental represent approximately of the company total loss reserves 
international and other represents a combination of different product lines  some of which are in runoff 
comparative historical information is not available for international product lines as insurers domiciled outside of the us do not file us statutory reports 
comparative historical information on runoff business is not indicative of reasonably possible one year changes in the reserve estimate for this mix of runoff business 
accordingly  the company has not included comparative analyses for international and other 
reinsurance recoverables amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability 
the company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies 
in addition  in the ordinary course of business  the company becomes involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers 
some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the company rights and obligations under the 
table of contents various reinsurance agreements 
the company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes 
the reinsurance agreements that the company entered into as part of its catastrophe bond programs are dual trigger contracts and meet the requirements to be accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with guidance for accounting for reinsurance contracts 
the company catastrophe bond programs are described in more detail in the catastrophe reinsurance coverage section herein 
the company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables 
the allowance is based upon the company ongoing review of amounts outstanding  length of collection periods  changes in reinsurer credit standing  disputes  applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors 
accordingly  the establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates 
from time to time  as a result of the long tailed nature of the underlying liabilities  coverage complexities and potential for disputes  the company considers the commutation of reinsurance contracts 
changes in estimated reinsurance recoverables and commutation activity could result in additional income statement charges 
recoverables attributable to structured settlements relate primarily to personal injury claims  of which workers compensation claims comprise a significant portion  for which the company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of a default by the companies issuing the annuities 
recoverables attributable to mandatory pools and associations relate primarily to workers compensation service business 
these recoverables are supported by the participating insurance companies obligation to pay a pro rata share based on each company voluntary market share of written premium in each state in which it is a pool participant 
in the event a member of a mandatory pool or association defaults on its share of the pool or association obligations  the other members share of such obligation increases proportionally 
on august   in a reinsurance dispute in new york state court captioned united states fidelity guaranty company v 
american re insurance company  et al  the trial court granted summary judgment for the company  and on october   entered judgment awarding the company million plus pre judgment interest in the amount of million 
the judgment  including the award of interest  has been appealed 
see note of notes to the company consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this reinsurance dispute 
the following table summarizes the composition of the company reinsurance recoverable assets at december  in millions gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses allowance for uncollectible reinsurance net reinsurance recoverables structured settlements mandatory pools and associations total reinsurance recoverables the billion decline in net reinsurance recoverables since december  reflected cash collections and the impact of net favorable prior year reserve development  partially offset by a reduction in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance that included the impact of a million benefit resulting from the summary judgment in the reinsurance dispute referenced above 
as a result  at december   reinsurance recoverables included the full million owed to the company under the terms of the related reinsurance agreement 

table of contents investment valuation and impairments fair value measurements the company estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance 
the framework is based on the inputs used in valuation  gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets  and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available 
the disclosure of fair value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable 
in determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed  the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the company significant market assumptions 
the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows level unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the company has the ability to access 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets  or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable eg  interest rates  yield curves  prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severities  etc 
or can be corroborated by observable market data 
level valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable 
the unobservable inputs reflect the company own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use 
valuation of investments reported at fair value in financial statements the fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable  unrelated  willing parties  ie  not in a forced transaction 
the estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that could be realized if the security was sold in an immediate sale  eg  a forced transaction 
additionally  the valuation of fixed maturity investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based inputs  which may increase the potential that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur 
for investments that have quoted market prices in active markets  the company uses the quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in level of the hierarchy 
the company receives the quoted market prices from a third party  nationally recognized pricing service pricing service 
when quoted market prices are unavailable  the company utilizes a pricing service to determine an estimate of fair value  which is mainly used for its fixed maturity investments 
the fair value estimates provided from this pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level of the hierarchy 
if quoted market prices and an estimate from a pricing service are unavailable  the company produces an estimate of fair value based on internally developed valuation techniques  which  depending on the level of observable market inputs  will render the fair value estimate as level or level the company bases all of its estimates of fair value for assets on the bid price as it represents what a third party market participant would be willing to pay in an arm length transaction 
fixed maturities the company utilizes a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately of its fixed maturities 
the pricing service utilizes market quotations for fixed maturity securities that have quoted prices in active markets 
since fixed maturities other than us treasury securities generally do not trade on a daily basis  the pricing service prepares estimates of fair value 
table of contents measurements for these securities using its proprietary pricing applications  which include available relevant market information  benchmark curves  benchmarking of like securities  sector groupings and matrix pricing 
additionally  the pricing service uses an option adjusted spread model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios 
the pricing service evaluates each asset class based on relevant market information  relevant credit information  perceived market movements and sector news 
the market inputs utilized in the pricing evaluation  listed in the approximate order of priority  include benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers  reference data  and industry and economic events 
the extent of the use of each market input depends on the asset class and the market conditions 
depending on the security  the priority of the use of inputs may change or some market inputs may not be relevant 
for some securities  additional inputs may be necessary 
the pricing service utilized by the company has indicated that they will only produce an estimate of fair value if there is objectively verifiable information to produce a valuation 
if the pricing service discontinues pricing an investment  the company would be required to produce an estimate of fair value using some of the same methodologies as the pricing service but would have to make assumptions for market based inputs that are unavailable due to market conditions 
the fair value estimates of most fixed maturity investments are based on observable market information rather than market quotes 
accordingly  the estimates of fair value for such fixed maturities  other than us treasury securities  provided by the pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level of the hierarchy 
the estimated fair value of us treasury securities is included in the amount disclosed in level as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices 
the company reviews the estimates of fair value provided by the pricing service and compares the estimates to the company knowledge of the market to determine if the estimates obtained are representative of the prices in the market 
the company produces a report monthly that lists all price changes from the previous month in excess of 
the company reviews the report and will challenge any prices deemed not to be representative of fair value 
in addition  the company has implemented various other processes including randomly selecting purchased or sold securities and comparing execution prices to the estimates from the pricing service as well as reviewing reports that contain securities whose valuation did not change from their previous valuation stale price review 
the company also uses an additional independent pricing service to further test the primary pricing service valuation of the company fixed maturity portfolio 
these processes have not highlighted any significant issues with the fair value estimates received from the pricing service 
the company holds privately placed corporate bonds and estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal matrix that is based on market information regarding interest rates  credit spreads and liquidity 
the underlying source data for calculating the matrix of credit spreads relative to the us treasury curve are the bofa merrill lynch us corporate index and the bofa merrill lynch high yield bb rated index 
the company includes the fair value estimates of these corporate bonds in level  since all significant inputs are market observable 
as many of these securities are issued by public companies  the company compares the estimates of fair value to the fair values of these companies publicly traded debt to test the validity of the internal pricing matrix 
while the vast majority of the company municipal bonds are included in level  the company holds a small number of municipal bonds which are not valued by the pricing service and estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal pricing matrix with some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation 
due to the limited amount of observable market information  the company includes the fair value estimates for these particular bonds in level additionally  the company holds a small amount of fixed maturities that have characteristics that make them unsuitable for matrix pricing 
for these fixed maturities  the company obtains a quote from a broker typically a market 
table of contents maker 
due to the disclaimers on the quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only  the company includes these fair value estimates in level see note of notes to the company consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the determination of fair value of non fixed maturities and valuation of investments not reported at fair value in the financial statements 
investment impairments the company conducts a periodic review to identify and evaluate invested assets having other than temporary impairments 
some of the factors considered in identifying other than temporary impairments include for fixed maturity investments  whether the company intends to sell the investment or whether it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the investment prior to an anticipated recovery in value  for non fixed maturity investments  the company ability and intent to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  the likelihood of the recoverability of principal and interest for fixed maturity securities ie  whether there is a credit loss  or cost for equity securities  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed maturity securities or cost for equity securities  and the financial condition  near term and long term prospects for the issuer  including the relevant industry conditions and trends  and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices 
reporting of other than temporary impairments for fixed maturity investments that the company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the company would not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value  the company separates the credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors and reports the credit loss component in net realized investment gains losses 
the impairment related to all other factors is reported in accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources 
for non fixed maturity investments and for fixed maturity investments the company intends to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value  the full amount of the impairment is included in net realized investment gains losses 
upon recognizing an other than temporary impairment  the new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis less the other than temporary impairment recognized in net realized investment gains losses 
the new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value  however  for fixed maturity investments  the difference between the new cost basis and the expected cash flows is accreted on a quarterly basis to net investment income over the remaining expected life of the investment 
due to the subjective nature of the company analysis and estimates of future cash flows  along with the judgment that must be applied in the analysis  it is possible that the company could reach a different conclusion whether or not to impair a security if it had access to additional information about the issuer 
additionally  it is possible that the issuer actual ability to meet contractual obligations may be different than what the company determined during its analysis  which may lead to a different impairment conclusion in future periods

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates inclusive of credit spreads  foreign currency exchange rates and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of the company primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are managed as of december  the company market risk sensitive instruments  including derivatives  are primarily entered into for purposes other than trading 
the carrying value of the company investment portfolio at december  and was billion and billion  respectively  of which and was invested in fixed maturity securities  respectively 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the company invested assets were denominated in foreign currencies 
the company exposure to equity price risk is not significant 
the company has no direct commodity risk and is not a party to any credit default swaps 
the primary market risks to the investment portfolio are interest rate risk and credit risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities 
the portfolio duration relative to the liabilities duration is primarily managed through cash market transactions and treasury futures transactions 
at december  and  the company fixed maturity investment portfolio included collateralized mortgage obligations backed by alternative documentation mortgages and asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages with a collective fair value of million and million  respectively comprising approximately and of the company total fixed maturity investments  respectively 
the disruption in secondary investment markets for mortgage backed securities provided the company with the opportunity to selectively acquire additional 
table of contents asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages at discounted prices 
the company purchased million and million of such securities in and  respectively 
the company defines sub prime mortgage backed securities as investments in which the underlying loans primarily exhibit one or more of the following characteristics low fico scores  above prime interest rates  high loan to value ratios or high debt to income ratios 
alternative documentation securitizations are those in which the underlying loans primarily meet the government sponsored entities requirements for credit score but do not meet the government sponsored entities guidelines for documentation  property type  debt and loan to value ratios 
the average credit rating on these securities and obligations held by the company was baa and a at december  and  respectively 
the company fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  included securities issued by numerous states  municipalities and political subdivisions collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio  a number of which were enhanced by third party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default 
the downgrade of credit ratings of insurers of these securities in recent years has resulted in a corresponding downgrade in the ratings of the securities to the underlying rating of the respective security 
of the insured municipal securities in the company investment portfolio at december   approximately were rated at a or above  and approximately were rated at aa or above  without the benefit of insurance 
the company believes that a loss of the benefit of insurance would not result in a material adverse impact on the company results of operations  financial position or liquidity  due to the underlying credit strength of the issuers of the securities  as well as the company ability and intent to hold the securities 
the average credit rating of the underlying issuers of these securities was aa at december  the average credit rating of the entire municipal bond portfolio was aa at december  with and without the third party insurance 
on april   municipal securities issued by local governments within the united states were assigned a negative outlook by moody investors service 
notwithstanding the relatively low historical rates of default on many of these obligations and notwithstanding that the company typically seeks to invest in high credit quality securities including those with structural protections such as being secured by dedicated or pledged sources of revenue  during or following an economic downturn  the company municipal bond portfolio could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue 
the severity and duration of state and local government budget deficits could have an adverse impact on the collectability and valuation of the company municipal bond portfolio 
in addition  some issuers may be unwilling to increase tax rates  or to reduce spending  to fund interest or principal payments on their municipal bonds  or may be unable to access the municipal bond market to fund such payments 
the risk of widespread defaults may increase if some issuers voluntarily choose to default  instead of implementing difficult fiscal measures  and the actual or perceived consequences such as reduced access to capital markets are less severe than expected 
the risk may also increase if there are changes in legislation that permit states  or additional municipalities and political subdivisions  to file for bankruptcy protection or if there are judicial interpretations that  in a bankruptcy or other proceeding  lessen the value of structural protections 
the company tax exempt fixed maturity investment portfolio totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
federal and or state tax legislation could be enacted that would lessen or improve some or all of the tax advantages currently benefiting the company and result in an adverse or favorable impact on the value of these holdings 
the primary market risk for all of the company debt is interest rate risk at the time of refinancing 
the company monitors the interest rate environment and evaluates refinancing opportunities as maturity dates approach

table of contents the company foreign exchange market risk exposure is concentrated in the company invested assets and insurance reserves denominated in foreign currencies 
cash flows from the company foreign operations are the primary source of funds for the purchase of investments denominated in foreign currencies 
the company purchases these investments primarily to fund insurance reserves and other liabilities denominated in the same currency  effectively reducing its foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
invested assets denominated in the british pound sterling comprised approximately of the total invested assets at both december  and invested assets denominated in the canadian dollar comprised approximately and of the total invested assets at december  and  respectively 
invested assets denominated in other currencies at december  and were not material 
there were no other significant changes in the company primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures were managed for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the company does not currently anticipate significant changes in its primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period of time 
in the company sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near term changes in those rates 
near term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure  especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by the company to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value 
interest rate risk in this sensitivity analysis model  the company uses fair values to measure its potential loss 
the sensitivity analysis model includes the following financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading fixed maturities  non redeemable preferred stocks  mortgage loans  short term securities  debt and derivative financial instruments 
the primary market risk to the company market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk inclusive of credit spreads 
the sensitivity analysis model uses a basis point change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model 
for invested assets with primary exposure to interest rate risk  estimates of portfolio duration and convexity are used to model the loss of fair value that would be expected to result from a parallel increase in interest rates 
durations on invested assets are adjusted for call  put and interest rate reset features 
durations on tax exempt securities are adjusted for the fact that the yields on such securities do not normally move in lockstep with changes in the us treasury curve 
fixed maturity portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis  including accrued interest  using holdings as of december  and for debt  the change in fair value is determined by calculating hypothetical december  and ending prices based on yields adjusted to reflect a basis point change  comparing such hypothetical ending prices to actual ending prices  and multiplying the difference by the par or securities outstanding 

table of contents the sensitivity analysis model used by the company produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of approximately billion and billion based on a basis point increase in interest rates at december  and  respectively 
the loss estimates do not take into account the impact of possible interventions that the company might reasonably undertake in order to mitigate or avoid losses that would result from emerging interest rate trends 
in addition  the loss value only reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of the company financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company uses fair values of investment securities to measure its potential loss from foreign denominated investments 
a hypothetical reduction in value of foreign denominated investments is used to estimate the impact on the market value of the foreign denominated holdings 
the company analysis indicates that a hypothetical reduction in the value of foreign denominated investments would be expected to produce a loss in fair value of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december   the company had a definitive agreement to commence a joint venture with j 
malucelli  through the acquisition of approximately of j 
malucelli common stock 
the purchase price for this acquisition will be r million brazilian reais the us dollar equivalent of which will depend on the exchange rate at closing plus an amount based on a brazilian inter bank lending rate cdi from january  through the closing date of the transaction 
in order to reduce its exposure to a significant strengthening of the brazilian reais prior to the closing of the transaction  the company entered into a foreign currency option contract on february  in the notional amount of r million which expires on march
