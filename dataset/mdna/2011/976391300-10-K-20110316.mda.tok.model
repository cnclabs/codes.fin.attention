overview as a diversified reit  we operate in three strategic segments i operating properties  ii loan assets  and iii reit securities 
as such  we seek to focus our investing in the segment we believe will generate the greater overall return to us given market conditions at the time 
during  we shifted our investment focus from reit securities which we believed were undervalued in to loan assets as our belief was  and continues to be  that investments in that level of the capital stack are more likely to generate a greater overall return 
accordingly  we invested in new loan assets and divested of a substantial portion of our reit securities 
we funded our investment activity in from cash reserves  proceeds from our reit securities divestments and our public offering in september which netted cash proceeds of approximately  at december   we held  in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and  in reit securities 
in addition  in march we extended and modified our revolving line of credit 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
with respect to our operating results for  net income attributable to common shares was  or per common share as compared with a loss of  or loss of per common share 
the most significant factor in this increase was the increase in earnings from our loan assets segment due to our additional investments in and the negative impact in to this segment caused by the impairments taken on our concord investment 
see results of operations below 
as discussed in more detail below  for we expect that it is likely that our overall operating results at our existing operating properties will decline due primarily to the overall portfolio decline in occupancy experienced in in addition  we expect that operations from our loan assets segment will be enhanced as we continue to seek investments in this segment and our expectation that with the recent favorable ruling in the concord real estate cdo  ltd 
litigation we will receive cash distributions from our investment in cdh cdo 
with respect to our reit securities segment  we expect to invest when we see opportunity and divest in our holdings where we believe that our return has been maximized 

table of contents loan assets as noted above  consistent with our investment strategy to focus our investing in the segment we believe will generate the greater overall return to us  during we concentrated our acquisition activity on our loan asset segment 
the concentration in the loan asset segment was due to our belief that loan assets provided the best area for a current return in the form of interest payments as well as appreciation either through acquiring loan assets at a discount or acquiring loan assets with the expectation of a borrower default that will lead to foreclosure and an equity ownership interest 
in acquiring loan assets  we target loan investments with underlying collateral value  future income return potential and in certain cases  non performing loans with the possibility that our debt position will be converted into equity participation 
as a result  we invested approximately  in new loan assets during consisting of whole loans  b notes  mezzanine loans and loan securities 
during we foreclosed on the collateral securing three of our loan assets we acquired in with a carrying value of  resulting in our becoming the owner of the underlying properties
