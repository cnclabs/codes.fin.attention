table of contents because these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements for a number of important reasons  including those discussed above in item a 
risk factors risks related to our business 
overview we are a publicly traded limited partnership with a diverse set of operations focused primarily in the united states gulf coast region 
our four primary business lines include terminalling and storage services for petroleum and by products  natural gas services  sulfur and sulfur based products gathering  processing  marketing  manufacturing and distribution  and marine transportation services for petroleum products and by products 
the petroleum products and by products we gather  process  transport  store and market are produced primarily by major and independent oil and gas companies who often turn to third parties  such as us  for the transportation and disposition of these products 
in addition to these major and independent oil and gas companies  our primary customers include independent refiners  large chemical companies  fertilizer manufacturers and other wholesale purchasers of these products 
we generate the majority of our cash flow from fee based contracts with these customers 
our location in the gulf coast region of the united states provides us strategic access to a major hub for petroleum refining  natural gas gathering and processing and support services for the exploration and production industry 
we were formed in by martin resource management  a privately held company whose initial predecessor was incorporated in as a supplier of products and services to drilling rig contractors 
since then  martin resource management has expanded its operations through acquisitions and internal expansion initiatives as its management identified and capitalized on the needs of producers and purchasers of hydrocarbon products and by products and other bulk liquids 
as of march   martin resource management owns an approximate limited partnership interest in us 
furthermore  it owns and controls our general partner  which owns a general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in us 
the historical operation of our business segments by martin resource management provides us with several decades of experience and a demonstrated track record of customer service across our operations 
our current lines of business have been developed and systematically integrated over this period of more than years  including natural gas services s  sulfur s  marine transportation late s and terminalling and storage early s 
this development of a diversified and integrated set of assets and operations has produced a complementary portfolio of midstream services that facilitates the maintenance of long term customer relationships and encourages the development of new customer relationships 
developments and subsequent events global financial markets and economic conditions have been  and continue to be volatile 
numerous events have restricted current liquidity in the capital markets throughout the united states and around the world 
one of the features driving investment in master limited partnerships  including us  has been the opportunity for distribution growth offered by the partnerships 
such distribution growth is a function of having access to liquidity in the financial markets used for incremental capital investment development projects and acquisitions to grow distributable cash flow 
growth opportunities have been  and may be further constrained by a lack of liquidity in the financial markets 
during much of the financial markets were available to us 
as such  we were able to issue senior unsecured long term debt in the first quarter and equity in both the first and third quarters of additionally  as discussed in the subsequent events section within this item  we were able to issue equity in february for the purpose of reducing outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility 
conditions in our industry continued to be challenging throughout for example the general decline in drilling activity by gas producers in our areas of operations in northeast texas which began during the fourth quarter of as a result of the global economic crisis continues 
several gas producers in our areas of operation have substantially reduced drilling activity during and as compared to their drilling levels during coupled with the general decline in drilling activity is the federal government s enhanced safety regulations and inspection requirements as it relates to deep water drilling in the gulf of mexico 
on october   the united states government lifted the moratorium on deep water permitting and drilling 
however  these enhanced safety regulations and inspection requirements of the bureau of ocean energy management  regulation  and enforcement boemre continue to provide uncertainty surrounding the requirements for and pace of issuance of permits on the gulf of mexico outer continental shelf ocs 

table of contents the decline in the demand for marine transportation services based on decreased refinery production resulted in an oversupply of equipment which was partially offset by the marine transportation services required in the efforts to clean up the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico 
despite the reduced drilling activity and the decline in the demand for marine transportation services  we are positioning ourselves to benefit from a recovering economy 
in particular we adjusted our business strategy for and to focus on maximizing our liquidity  maintaining a stable asset base  and improving the profitability of our assets by increasing their utilization while controlling costs 
we reduced our capital expenditures in  but increased them in based on our capital raised in both the debt and equity markets during the year 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to enter into commodity hedging transactions to further reduce our commodity price risk 
we completed the disposition of certain non strategic assets including the april sale of the mont belvieu railcar unloading facility for million  and we may consider marketing certain other non strategic assets in the future 
our near term financial focus is to ensure that we have appropriate levels of liquidity to fund our growth programs and potentially increase the distribution rate to our unitholders 
the uncertain economic environment of recent years and ongoing litigation at martin resource management created a challenge in obtaining such liquidity 
however  in the past year we have had access to the capital markets and now have appropriate levels of liquidity and operating cash flows to adequately fund our growth 
recent acquisitions acquisition of the darco gathering system 
on november   we  through our wholly owned subsidiary  prism gas  acquired approximately miles of natural gas gathering pipeline and various equipment located in harrison county  texas for approximately million 
we financed this acquisition with borrowings under our revolving loan facility 
acquisition by waskom of the harrison pipeline system 
on january   we  through prism gas  as owner and the operator of waskom gas processing company wgpc  through wgpc s wholly owned subsidiary waskom midstream llc  acquired from crosstex north texas gathering  lp  a interest in approximately miles of gathering pipeline  two mmcfd dew point control plants and equipment referred to as the harrison pipeline system 
our share of the acquisition cost is approximately million 
other developments public offerings 
on august   we completed a public offering of million common units  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after payment of underwriters discounts 
we used the net proceeds of million to redeem from subsidiaries of martin resource management an aggregate number of common units equal to the number of common units issued in the offering 
martin resource management reimbursed us for our payments of commissions and offering expenses 
as a result of these transactions  our general partner was not required to contribute cash to us in conjunction with the issuance of these units in order to maintain its general partner interest in us since there was no net increase in the outstanding limited partner units 
on february   we completed a public offering of  common units  resulting in net proceeds of million  after payment of underwriters discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
our general partner contributed million in cash to us in conjunction with the issuance in order to maintain its general partner interest in us 
the net proceeds were used to pay down revolving debt under our credit facility 
debt financing activities 
effective march   our credit facility was amended to i decrease the size of our aggregate facility from million to million  ii convert all term loans to revolving loans  iii extend the maturity date from november  to march   iv permit us to invest up to million in our joint ventures  v eliminate the covenant that limits our ability to make capital expenditures  vi decrease the applicable interest rate margin on committed revolver loans  vii limit our ability to make future acquisitions and viii adjust the financial covenants 
for a more detailed discussion regarding our credit facility  see description of our long term debt credit facility within this item 

table of contents on march   we completed a private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due notes to qualified institutional buyers under rule a 
we received proceeds of approximately million  after deducting initial purchasers discounts and the expenses of the private placement 
the proceeds were primarily used to repay borrowings under the partnership s revolving credit facility 
pursuant to the terms of a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the offering of the notes  we filed an exchange offer registration statement with the sec on september  with respect to an offer to exchange the notes for registered notes with substantially identical terms 
the registration statement was declared effective by the sec and the exchange offer was completed in the fourth quarter of subsequent events public offering 
on february   we completed a public offering of  common units  our general partner contributed million in cash to in order to maintain its general partner interest in us acquisition of certain terminalling assets 
on january   we acquired shore based marine terminalling facilities  one specialty terminalling facility and certain terminalling related assets from martin resource management for million 
the net book value of the acquired assets was recorded in property  plant and equipment 
these assets are located across the louisiana gulf coast 
this acquisition was funded by borrowings under our revolving loan facility 
quarterly distribution 
on january   we declared a quarterly cash distribution of per common unit for the fourth quarter of  or per common unit on an annualized basis  to be paid on february  to unitholders of record as of february   reflecting a increase over the quarterly distribution paid in respect to the third quarter of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on the historical consolidated and condensed financial statements included elsewhere herein 
we prepared these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our results may differ from these estimates 
currently  we believe that our accounting policies do not require us to make estimates using assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain 
however  we have described below the critical accounting policies that we believe could impact our consolidated and condensed financial statements most significantly 
you should also read note  significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
some of the more significant estimates in these financial statements include the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and the determination of the fair value of our reporting units as it relates to our annual goodwill evaluation 
derivatives all derivatives and hedging instruments are included on the balance sheet as an asset or liability measured at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
if a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting  changes in the fair value can be offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until such time as the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
our hedging policy allows us to use hedge accounting for financial transactions that are designated as hedges 
derivative instruments not designated as hedges or hedges that become ineffective are being marked to market with all market value adjustments being recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   we have designated a portion of our derivative instruments as qualifying cash flow hedges 
fair value changes for these hedges have been recorded in other comprehensive income as a component of partners capital 
product exchanges we enter into product exchange agreements with third parties whereby we agree to exchange natural gas liquids ngls and sulfur with third parties 
we record the balance of exchange products due to other companies under these agreements at quoted market product prices and the balance of exchange products due from other companies at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
revenue and costs related to product exchanges are recorded on a gross basis 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue for our four operating segments is recognized as follows terminalling and storage revenue is recognized for storage contracts based on the contracted monthly tank fixed fee 
for throughput contracts  revenue is recognized based on the volume moved through our terminals at the contracted rate 
for our tolling agreement  revenue is recognized based on the contracted monthly reservation fee and throughput volumes moved through the facility 
when lubricants and drilling fluids are sold by truck  revenue is recognized upon delivering product to the customers as title to the product transfers when the customer physically receives the product 
natural gas services natural gas gathering and processing revenues are recognized when title passes or service is performed 
ngl distribution revenue is recognized when product is delivered by truck to our ngl customers  which occurs when the customer physically receives the product 
when product is sold in storage  or by pipeline  we recognize ngl distribution revenue when the customer receives the product from either the storage facility or pipeline 
sulfur services revenue is recognized when the customer takes title to the product at our plant or the customer facility 
marine transportation revenue is recognized for contracted trips upon completion of the particular trip 
for time charters  revenue is recognized based on a per day rate 
equity method investments we use the equity method of accounting for investments in unconsolidated entities where the ability to exercise significant influence over such entities exists 
investments in unconsolidated entities consist of capital contributions and advances plus our share of accumulated earnings as of the entities latest fiscal year ends  less capital withdrawals and distributions 
investments in excess of the underlying net assets of equity method investees  specifically identifiable to property  plant and equipment  are amortized over the useful life of the related assets 
excess investment representing equity method goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment  annually 
this goodwill is not subject to amortization and is accounted for as a component of the investment 
equity method investments are subject to impairment evaluation 
no portion of the net income from these entities is included in our operating income 
we own an unconsolidated of the ownership interests in waskom gas processing company waskom  matagorda offshore gathering system matagorda and panther interstate pipeline energy llc pipe 
each of these interests is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
goodwill goodwill is subject to a fair value based impairment test on an annual basis 
we are required to identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets 
we are required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we would be required to perform the second step of the impairment test  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
all four of our reporting units  terminalling and storage  marine transportation  natural gas services and sulfur services  contain goodwill 
we have performed the annual impairment tests as of september   september   and september   and we have determined fair value in each reporting unit based on the weighted average of three valuation techniques i the discounted cash flow method  ii the guideline public company method  and iii the guideline transaction method 
at september   and the estimated fair value of each of our four reporting units was in excess of its carrying value resulting in no impairment 
as a result of the deterioration in the overall stock market subsequent to september  and the decline in our unit price  we reviewed specific factors  as outlined in under certain provisions of asc  to determine if we had a trigging event that required us to test our goodwill for impairment as of december  these factors included whether there have been any significant fundamental changes since our annual impairment test to i our business as a whole or to the reporting units  including regulatory changes  ii our level of operating cash flows  iii our expectation of future levels of operating cash flows  iv our executive management team and v the carrying value of our other long lived assets 
while these factors did not indicate a triggering event occurred  our unit price fell to a point by december   that resulted in our total market capitalization being less than our partner s equity 
we determined this to be a triggering event requiring us to perform an impairment test as of december  as a result of our goodwill impairment test for each of the four reporting units as of december   no impairment was determined to exist 

table of contents no such triggering events occurred that would cause us to perform an impairment test at either december  or significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit which could give rise to future impairment 
changes to these estimates and assumptions can include  but may not be limited to  varying commodity prices  volume changes and operating costs due to market conditions and or alternative providers of services 
environmental liabilities and litigation we have not historically experienced circumstances requiring us to account for environmental remediation obligations 
if such circumstances arise  we would estimate remediation obligations utilizing a remediation feasibility study and any other related environmental studies that we may elect to perform 
we would record changes to our estimated environmental liability as circumstances change or events occur  such as the issuance of revised orders by governmental bodies or court or other judicial orders and our evaluation of the likelihood and amount of the related eventual liability 
because the outcomes of both contingent liabilities and litigation are difficult to predict  when accounting for these situations  significant management judgment is required 
amounts paid for contingent liabilities and litigation have not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition and we do not anticipate they will in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts in evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable  we assess a number of factors  including a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  we record specific and general reserves for bad debts to reduce the related receivables to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers 
our management closely monitors potentially uncollectible accounts 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are revised each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than the historical experience  management s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could potentially be adversely affected 
these charges have not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
asset retirement obligation we recognize and measure our asset and conditional asset retirement obligations and the associated asset retirement cost upon acquisition of the related asset and based upon the estimate of the cost to settle the obligation at its anticipated future date 
the obligation is accreted to its estimated future value and the asset retirement cost is depreciated over the estimated life of the asset 
estimates of future asset retirement obligations include significant management judgment and are based on projected future retirement costs 
such costs could differ significantly when they are incurred 
revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations can result from changes in retirement cost estimates due to surface repair  and labor and material costs  revisions to estimated inflation rates and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment 
for example  the company does not have access to natural gas reserves information related to our gathering systems to estimate when abandonment will occur

due to the foregoing  we believe that cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  anticipated maintenance capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments in due to restrictions on liquidity within the capital markets and the existing litigation at martin resource management our ability to access the capital markets in the future may be constrained 
our near term focus is to ensure we have sufficient liquidity to fund our growth programs  while continuing the present distribution rate to our unitholders 
the uncertain economic environment and the existing litigation at martin resource management has created a challenging operating environment for us to maintain our liquidity and operating cash flows at levels consistent with the recent past while maintaining the present distribution rate to our unitholders 
we continue to evaluate our liquidity and capital resources and we have and will continue to consider sales of non essential assets and other available options for additional liquidity 
for example  in the second quarter of we sold the assets comprising the mont belvieu railcar unloading facility to enterprise products operating llc 
see note to our financial statements gain on disposal of assets 
within the constraints noted above  we intend to move forward with our commercially supported internal growth projects 
we may revise the timing and scope of other projects as necessary to adapt to existing economic  capital market and litigation conditions affecting us 
finally  our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements  to fund planned capital expenditures and to satisfy our debt service obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which is subject to certain risks

each of the swaps were scheduled to mature in november  but were terminated in march seasonality a substantial portion of our revenues are dependent on sales prices of products  particularly ngls and sulfur based fertilizer products  which fluctuate in part based on winter and spring weather conditions 
the demand for ngls is strongest during the winter heating season 
the demand for fertilizers is strongest during the early spring planting season 
however  our terminalling and storage and marine transportation businesses and the molten sulfur business are typically not impacted by seasonal fluctuations 
we expect to derive approximately half of our net income from our terminalling and storage  marine transportation  natural gas and sulfur businesses 
therefore  we do not expect that our overall net income will be impacted by seasonality factors 
however  extraordinary weather events  such as hurricanes  have in the past  and could in the future  impact our terminalling and storage and marine transportation businesses 
for example  hurricanes gustav and ike in the third quarter of and hurricanes katrina and rita in the third quarter of adversely impacted our operating expenses and adversely impacted our terminalling and storage and marine transportation business s revenues 
impact of inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations in  and however  inflation remains a factor in the united states economy and could increase our cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment as well as our labor and supply costs 
we cannot assure our unitholders that we will be able to pass along increased costs to our customers 
increasing energy prices could adversely affect our results of operations 
diesel fuel  natural gas  chemicals and other supplies are recorded in operating expenses 
an increase in price of these products would increase our operating expenses which could adversely affect net income 
we cannot assure our unitholders that we will be able to pass along increased operating expenses to our customers

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we are exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices  counterparty credit and interest rates 
for the year ended december   changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts were recorded both in earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income aoci since we have designated a portion of our derivative instruments as hedges as of december  commodity price risk we are exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices  counterparty credit and interest rates 
under our hedging policy  we monitor and manage the commodity market risk associated with the commodity risk exposure of prism gas 
in addition  we are focusing on utilizing counterparties for these transactions whose financial condition is appropriate for the credit risk involved in each specific transaction 
we use derivatives to manage the risk of commodity price fluctuations 
these outstanding contracts expose us to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
we have incurred no losses associated with counterparty nonperformance on derivative contracts 
on all transactions where we are exposed to counterparty risk  we analyze the counterparty s financial condition prior to entering into an agreement  establish a maximum credit limit threshold pursuant to our hedging policy  and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis 
we have agreements with five counterparties containing collateral provisions 
based on those current agreements  cash deposits are required to be posted whenever the net fair value of derivatives associated with the individual counterparty exceed a specific threshold 
if this threshold is exceeded  cash is posted by us if the value of derivatives is a liability to us 
as of december   we have no cash collateral deposits posted with counterparties 
we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of natural gas  ngls and condensate as a result of gathering  processing and sales activities 
our exposure to these fluctuations is primarily in the gas processing component of our business 
gathering and processing revenues are earned under various contractual arrangements with gas producers 
gathering revenues are generated through a combination of fixed fee and index related arrangements 
processing revenues are generated primarily through contracts which provide for processing on percent of liquids and percent of proceeds basis 
percent of liquids contracts under these contracts  we receive a fee in the form of a percentage of the ngls recovered  and the producer bears all of the cost of natural gas shrink 
therefore  margins increase during periods of high ngl prices and decrease during periods of low ngl prices 
percent of proceeds contracts under these contracts  we generally gather and process natural gas on behalf of certain producers  sell the resulting residue gas and ngls at market prices and remit to producers an agreed upon percentage of the proceeds based on an index price 
in other cases  instead of remitting cash payments to the producer  we deliver an agreed upon percentage of the residue gas and ngls to the producer and sell the volumes kept to third parties at market prices 
under these types of contracts  revenues and gross margins increase as natural gas prices and ngl prices increase  and revenues and gross margins decrease as natural gas and ngl prices decease 
market risk associated with gas processing margins by contract type  and gathering and transportation margins as a percent of total gross margin remained consistent for the years ended december  and as our contract mix and volumes associated with those contracts did not differ materially 
the aggregate effect of a hypothetical mmbtu increase or decrease in the natural gas price index would result in an approximate annual gross margin change of million 
in addition  the aggregate effect of a hypothetical bbl increase or decrease in the crude oil price index would result in an approximate annual gross margin change of million 
prism gas has entered into hedging transactions through to protect a portion of its commodity exposure from these contracts 
these hedging arrangements are in the form of swaps for crude oil  natural gas and natural gasoline 

table of contents based on estimated volumes  as of december   we had hedged approximately and of our commodity risk by volume for and  respectively 
as of march   prism gas has hedged approximately and of its commodity risk by volume for and  respectively 
we anticipate entering into additional commodity derivatives on an ongoing basis to manage our risks associated with these market fluctuations and will consider using various commodity derivatives  including forward contracts  swaps  collars  futures and options  although there is no assurance that we will be able to do so or that the terms thereof will be similar to our existing hedging arrangements 
the relevant payment indices for our various commodity contracts are as follows natural gas contracts monthly posting for anr pipeline co

in addition  substantially all of our natural gas and ngl sales are made at market based prices 
our standard gas and ngl sales contracts contain adequate assurance provisions which allows for the suspension of deliveries  cancellation of agreements or discontinuance of deliveries to the buyer unless the buyer provides security for payment in a form satisfactory to us 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our credit facility  which had a weighted average interest rate of as of december  as of march   we had a total of million of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility  all of which was unhedged floating rate debt 
based on the amount of unhedged floating rate debt owed by us on december   the impact of a increase in interest rates on this amount of debt would result in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in net income of approximately million annually 
historically  we have managed a portion of our interest rate risk on our revolving credit facility with interest rate swaps  which reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by converting variable interest rates to fixed interest rates 
during the first quarter  we terminated all of our interest rate swaps on our revolving credit facility 
we are not exposed to changes in interest rates with respect to our senior notes as these obligations are fixed rate 
the estimated fair value of the senior notes was approximately million as of december   based on market prices of similar debt at december  market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of our long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of in interest rates 
such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a million decrease in fair value of our long term debt at december  
table of contents we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the amount of interest we pay on our senior notes due in april pursuant to the terms of these interest rate swap agreements  we pay a variable rate interest payment based on the three month libor and receive a fixed rate 
the net difference to be paid or received from the counterparties under the interest rate swap agreement is settled quarterly and is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
the risk associated with these interest rate swaps exposes us to an increase in interest rates which would result in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in net income 
at december   we are party to interest rate swap agreements as shown below interest rate swaps as of december  date of swap bank maturity notional amount interest rate we pay interest rate we receive fair value asset in thousands fair value liability in thousands september suntrust april mo libor september rbs april mo libor
