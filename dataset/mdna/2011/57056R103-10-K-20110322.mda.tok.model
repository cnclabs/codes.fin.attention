overview market leader  inc is a leading provider of software as a service offerings and related services for the real estate industry 
market leader provides real estate agents  and brokerage companies with subscription software and advertising products that enable them to generate a steady stream of prospects  as well as the tools and training they need to convert these prospects into clients 
current year overview market leader s business saw an inflection point in as sequential quarterly revenue increased every quarter following four years of quarterly revenue declines 
we have been successful driving new revenue with a growing number of customers using our newer software as a service based products  and that revenue growth has largely offset attrition from our traditional products 
starting in the fourth quarter  additional software as a service revenues from the consolidation of activerain real estate network activerain drove annual revenue to million  a increase over the prior year 
we increased our activerain ownership percentage to at the end of third quarter with the acquisition of an additional of the outstanding voting stock of for activerain is a provider of professional networking  referral  recruitment  content syndication and online marketing services for a growing community of over  professionals in real estate and related businesses 
our incremental investment in activerain provides access to a sizable and rapidly growing professional community which we expect will help us increase our effectiveness in selling our premium software as a service offerings 
we continued to make progress shifting our business model toward our software as a service based products in we began to shift in from traditional lead generation products to offerings that combine software as a service with access to advertising buying and lead generation services 
our original business model is represented by our housevalues and justlisted products while our new model is represented by our products including growth leader and realtygenerator 
see business for a specific discussion of our products 
our acquisition of realty generator  llc in november enabled us to leverage the technology and business model acquired to develop these software as a service based products 
revenue from software as a service based products increased in from and represented of our revenue in  demonstrating the progress on our business model shift 
our longer term goal is to return the company to profitable growth  and we believe that to do so will require a resurgence in customer acquisition 
towards that goal  we accelerated our customer acquisition efforts during a significant portion of the increase was dedicated to the development and expansion of marketing programs through leading real estate franchise networks  based on our success with that channel in with realty executives international 
these efforts gained substantial traction with several leading franchise networks in  leading to significant signings of our realtygenerator product 
in addition  we expanded the sales team to expand our reach to the higher value brokerage office customers 

table of contents the significant majority of new brokerage customers signed in took advantage of compelling offers that waive set up and software as a service fees during the promotional period even while we incur and expense the costs of acquiring these customers as well as their lead generation costs 
initially  the acquisition of these customers has a substantial negative impact on our near term operating results as related expenses exceed the revenue that they contribute 
we expect to reap long term benefits as a result of these customer acquisition investments  based upon experience that suggests more than half of these customers will convert at the conclusion of the promotional periods to ongoing accounts that generate software as a service fees in addition to advertising revenue for the life of the customer 
we used cash in operations in as part of a strategy to better present our new solutions and to acquire customers we expect to have high lifetime value 
we believe that the strategic value of investment in our business has been significantly enhanced by our introduction of innovative products and new sales channels 
these benefits were exemplified by an agreement with keller william realty international keller williams that represents the largest deal in market leader history 
in january  we announced that market leader was selected by keller williams  one of the nation s largest real estate franchisors  to provide a franchise wide real estate marketing and business platform under a five year agreement 
the agreement provides for minimum payments from keller williams totaling approximately million through the initial term  beginning in april and paid on a quarterly basis 
in february  we successfully fulfilled the first phase of this agreement by making its platform available to nearly  keller williams agents across the united states and canada 
as a result  market leader is significantly increasing its user base as keller williams agents adopt this new platform 
in addition  we are increasing our ability to up sell premium software and services in the future 
overall  our agreement with keller williams is expected to begin to significantly contribute to revenue growth starting in the second half of while making strategic investments in our products and customer acquisition  we continue to avoid non strategic uses of cash 
we reduced a significant non strategic expense as a result of our successful renegotiation of our kirkland  washington facility lease midway through  realizing the full cost savings benefit in the lease amendment eliminated the expense of excess space  avoided fees for early lease termination  and kept the team in our current location focused on building the business 
results of operations the following table presents our historical operating results as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  revenues expenses sales and marketing technology and product development general and administrative depreciation and amortization of property and equipment amortization of acquired intangible assets total expenses loss from operations 
table of contents comparison of years ended december  and december  revenues years ended december  change percent change dollars in thousands revenues revenues increased from last year  reflecting the inclusion of activerain revenue in the fourth quarter of as well as an increase in our average monthly revenue per customer in for customers of products other than those offered by activerain 
the increased average revenue per customer is being driven in part by the increase in the number of high value realtygenerator customers from to ending customers at december  also increased compared to december  as a result of our success in driving a growing number of customers using our newer software as a service based products  which has offset attrition from our traditional products 
more detailed information about the change in revenue and customers is included under the heading  key operational metrics below 
based upon our increased focus on and investment in customer acquisition  we expect to grow revenue every quarter in  and that growth in our software as a service based products will more than offset continued attrition from our traditional products 
in addition  we expect revenue contribution from our new relationship with keller williams in the second half of the year 
sales and marketing years ended december  change percent change dollars in thousands sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of customer acquisition costs and lead generation costs  as well as customer support and servicing costs 
these expenses take the form of online advertising expenses  salaries  commissions and related expenses for our sales  marketing and customer support staff 
other expenses include corporate marketing and communications expenses and merchant card processing fees 
sales and marketing expense increased significantly in  consistent with our plans to invest in new customer acquisition 
customer acquisition costs increased with higher sales and marketing staffing levels and marketing programs  especially those targeted at franchise network relationships  as well as the addition of activerain s sales and marketing expenses beginning in the fourth quarter 
we also increased advertising costs as customer demand for lead generation services expanded relative to the growth in our software as a service based products 
lead generation costs are a higher percentage of revenue for those products  particularly for customers who are only paying for lead generation services during promotional periods 
we believe the software as a service based product offerings deliver better value for our customers and are driving better customer retention rates  leading to improved operating results over time 
in  we expect to continue to focus on customer acquisition and maintain that component of our sales and marketing spend 
advertising expenses will increase relative to increases in customer demand for lead generation services 
we also expect modest increases in our customer support and servicing costs as we grow our customer base 
however  we expect sales and marketing spend to decrease as a percentage of revenue during 
table of contents technology and product development years ended december  change percent change dollars in thousands technology and product development expense technology and product development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for employees responsible for customer and internal technology services 
also included are license fees  maintenance costs  internet and phone connectivity and hosting costs 
technology costs are reduced for the costs of new product development that are capitalized 
technology and product development expense increased modestly in due to the addition of activerain s technology costs beginning in the fourth quarter  as well as a higher level of activity to implement new products and to transition customers to a new software platform in  compared to the same period in in  we expect the level of technology and product development costs to increase as we incur third party software licensing costs that are part of the new product we are delivering to keller williams starting in the first quarter of technology expenses will fluctuate depending on the level of effort required to develop new products  which costs are subject to capitalization 
general and administrative years ended december  change percent change dollars in thousands general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  accounting  and human resources personnel 
these costs also include audit and legal fees  business consulting fees  business insurance premiums  rent and related expenses 
general and administrative expense decreased due to reduced staffing  professional fees and occupancy expenses 
staffing costs declined due to reduced headcount  lower stock compensation charges  and a decrease in the use of consultants 
lower occupancy expenses reflect the terms of our amended lease that reduced the size of our corporate headquarters 
these reduced expenses were partially offset by the addition of activerain s general and administrative expense effective in the fourth quarter of  as well as an increase in recruiting fees 
in  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in part from the addition of expenses from consolidating activerain operating results 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment depreciation and amortization of property and equipment decreased in primarily because many assets became fully depreciated during and due to the renegotiation of our office lease which accelerated the amortization on certain tenant improvements in 
table of contents amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of intangible assets decreased for when compared to  as certain intangible assets became fully amortized 
this decrease was partially offset by the addition of amortization on activerain intangible assets following our acquisition of a controlling interest late in the third quarter of equity in loss of unconsolidated subsidiary our equity in the losses of activerain in was consistent with the level in we will no longer report these results as activerain is now included in our consolidated operating results 
interest income and expense  net interest income decreased in when compared to due to decreased rates of return on investments as well as a reduction in the amount of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments held 
at december   we held million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments compared to million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  income taxes we recognized a million tax benefit in as a result of legislation passed in november that allowed us to carryback our operating losses and recover taxes paid in and there was no similar carryback opportunity in the majority of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to reverse over the next five years  except for prior years net operating losses 
we believe that based on the decline in the national real estate market and our continued operating losses  it is more likely than not that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  a full valuation allowance has been recorded against our deferred tax assets

real estate professional customers consist of real estate agents subscribing to our growth leader  team leader  housevalues  justlisted and market leader crm products and real estate brokers subscribing to our realtygenerator product 
one minus our average monthly churn rate equates to our average monthly retention rate 
average monthly customer churn is calculated by dividing the number of customers who canceled during the quarter by the average customers in the quarter  divided by the number of months in the quarter 
other companies may calculate churn and retention differently  and their churn and retention data may not be directly comparable to ours 
average real estate professional customers in the quarter are calculated as the average of customers at the beginning and at the end of the quarter 
average monthly revenue per customer is calculated as real estate professional revenue for the quarter divided by the average number of customers in the quarter 
ending customers at december  increased by customers compared to december  we have focused efforts on customer acquisition  particularly of higher value realtygenerator customer 
while our customer count increased modestly during  our brokerage office customers became an increased share of our customer base  which is helping to drive our revenue growth 
the average monthly retention rate for our customers was for the fourth quarter of  a decline from the third quarter of retention rate of 
while customer retention decreased this quarter  the rate remained strong when compared with the past sixteen directly comparable quarters 
we believe that the continued strong trend can be attributed to a combination of factors the increased portion of revenue from our software as a service based products  a smaller overall customer base  as well as the strong retention of customers who have been with us for two or more years 
however  due to the continued volatility of the real estate market and broader economic concerns  we expect to experience fluctuations in our customer retention rate from quarter to quarter 
average monthly revenue per customer for the fourth quarter of increased slightly compared to the third quarter of as a result of the shift in our product mix towards our broker and other software as a service based products 
average revenue per customer will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on our customer mix  as well as the mix of sales for products priced differently across lower and higher priced geographies  pricing adjustments we may make in response to the market conditions  the demand for existing services and the acceptance of new product offerings 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  as well as the cash flow that we may generate from our operations 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at december  as compared to million at december  we follow an investment strategy that prioritizes the preservation and security and liquidity of our funds  which has resulted in significantly lower rates of return 
as of december   we have invested in cash equivalents consisting of money market funds that hold u 
s 
treasury securities with short term weighted average duration 
short term investments are comprised of u 
s 
treasury bills and notes and fdic insured certificates of deposit with terms of one year or less 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our revenue trend  the level of our marketing and sales activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  and the timing of introductions of new services and enhancements to existing services

we used cash in operations of million in compared to cash used in operations of million in cash used in operations decreased in primarily due to the receipt of our income tax receivable that was largely offset by an increase in our net loss after non cash items

we did not make any purchases pursuant to the share repurchase program during at december    shares remain available for purchase under the share repurchase program 
during  an aggregate of  shares of our common stock were tendered at amounts between and per share  in satisfaction of employees income taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights the policies and estimates we feel are critical 
business combinations  intangible assets  and goodwill valuation when acquired 
we account for our business combinations using the purchase method of accounting  which requires that we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values on the date of acquisition  as well as the valuation of any contingent consideration 
significant judgment is used to estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired  including estimating future cash flows from the acquired business  determining appropriate discount rates  asset lives and other assumptions 

table of contents ongoing reporting and impairment testing 
our intangible assets  other than goodwill  and other long lived assets are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the assessment of impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill requires significant judgment to determine the asset groups and number of reporting units  to estimate future undiscounted cash flows  to use appropriate market value factors  to estimate the related asset lives and other assumptions as noted below 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the fair value determination and potential goodwill impairment 
results of impairment tests 
based on our continued operating losses  we evaluated our long lived assets for impairment during and and determined that our long lived assets were not impaired 
we evaluated our recently established goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of consistent with the outcome of our long lived asset assessment  we determined our goodwill was not impaired 
our impairment analysis for goodwill was dependent on many variables 
we determined the fair value of our net assets based on a combination of market and income approaches 
key assumptions used in the market approaches included the determination that we have a single reporting unit  the appropriate stock price to determine market value  use of control premium and determination of the appropriate control premium  and determination of an appropriate set of comparable companies 
key assumptions in the income approach were based on a discounted cash flow model  which included significant assumptions about our future revenues  expenses  target profitability rates  and determination of an appropriate discount rate 
our impairment analyses for our long lived assets other than goodwill included a number of key variables  included estimated future cash flows 
we determined the fair value of our long lived assets based on several key assumptions  including the determination that we have a single asset grouping  references to quoted market prices for similar assets  as well as assumptions about our future revenues  expenses  and target profitability rates 
as of december   we have million in goodwill and approximately million of long lived assets 
while we continue to depreciate the long lived assets  at the same time  we continue to capitalize costs related to internally generated software and may acquire other capital assets 
factors that may require future assessments of impairment of our goodwill and long lived assets include  among others  deterioration of our estimate of future cash flows  stock price  lower customer revenues and lower retention rates than projected 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for operating loss carryforwards in our existing business and related to acquisitions 
we must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine the provision for income taxes and the related current and deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the valuation allowance to be recorded against deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates must take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future tax audits 
new tax legislation was passed in november  which allowed us to carry back losses up to five years 
as a result  we recognized a million tax benefit in and received the related tax refund in changes in the amount of our operating losses  changes in the tax laws or our interpretation of the tax laws and the resolution of future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes and the amount of valuation allowances required in our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we have gross deferred tax assets of million  before reduction for our valuation allowance 
we considered all available evidence to determine whether a valuation allowance was 
table of contents required for those assets  including the following factors estimates regarding the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years as permitted under tax law  and historical taxable income normalized for non recurring items  expected future taxable income  and the impact of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
based on our current projections of future operating profits  we continue to believe that it is not likely that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets and continue to maintain a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets at december  we account for uncertainty in income taxes using a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of the tax benefits  determined on a cumulative probability basis  which is more likely than not to be realized upon effective settlement 
our accounting policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as tax expense 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation related to option grants using the fair value based method 
we use the black scholes pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including estimating the stock option expected life and stock price volatility 
changes in any of these assumptions could materially impact the estimated fair value of options granted 
the following table illustrates the effect of changing these significant variables on the estimated fair value of our options 
the following examples are hypothetical but representative of our option grants and their related fair values at december  in each analysis  the remaining variables are held constant 
this illustration is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation 
effect of a change in our stock price volatility estimate current volatility estimate stock option volatility estimated fair value effect of a year change in expected life of our stock options year current expected life estimate year estimated option life years years years estimated fair value recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurements and disclosures improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu  which requires additional disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement 
asu amends codification subtopic to require a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level of the fair value hierarchy and describe the reasons for the transfers 
the asu also requires additional information in the roll forward of level assets and liabilities including the presentation of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis 
the company adopted asu beginning january   with the exception of the additional information in the roll forward of level assets and liabilities  which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this adoption had no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows and we expect to provide any additional disclosure required for level assets and liabilities in our first quarter report in 
table of contents in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
asu establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue generating activities  and provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables  and measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the amendments of asu also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  including information about the nature and terms  significant deliverables  and its performance within arrangements 
the amendments also require providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
the amendments in asu are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we do not expect the adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
