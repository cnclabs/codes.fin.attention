therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
the company has not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements which would be reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect  such as obligations under certain guarantees or contracts  retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangements  obligations under certain derivative arrangements  and obligations under material variable interests

certain of these stores were sold in connection with the sale of the saks department store group to belk  inc in and the sale of the northern department store group to the bon ton stores  inc in if the purchasers fail to perform certain obligations under the leases guaranteed by the company  the company could have obligations to landlords under such guarantees

credit cards on april   the company sold its proprietary credit card portfolio  consisting of the proprietary credit card accounts owned by the national bank of the great lakes and the company s ownership interest in the assets of a trust  to hsbc  a third party financial institution 
as part of the transaction  for a term of ten years expiring in and pursuant to a program agreement  hsbc established and owns proprietary credit card accounts for customers of the company s operating subsidiaries  retains the benefits and risks associated with the ownership of the accounts  receives the finance charge income and incurs the bad debts associated with those accounts 
during the ten year term  pursuant to a servicing agreement  the company continues to provide key customer service functions  including new account openings  transaction authorizations  billing adjustments and customer inquiries  and receives compensation from hsbc for these services 
at the end of the ten year term expiring in  the agreement can be renewed for two two year terms 
at the end of the agreement  the company has the right to repurchase  at fair value  substantially all of the accounts and outstanding accounts receivable  negotiate a new agreement with hsbc or begin issuing private label credit cards itself or through others 
the agreement allows the company to terminate the agreement early following the occurrence of certain events  the most significant of which would be hsbc s failure to pay owed amounts  bankruptcy  a change in control or a material adverse change in hsbc s ability to perform under the agreement 
the agreement also allows for hsbc to terminate the agreement if the company fails to pay owed amounts or enters bankruptcy 
should either the company or hsbc choose to terminate the agreement early  the company has the right  but not the requirement  to repurchase substantially all credit card accounts and associated accounts receivable from hsbc at their fair value 
the company is contingently liable to pay monies to hsbc in the event of an early termination or a significant disposition of stores 
the contingent payment is based upon a declining portion of an amount established at the beginning of the ten year agreement and on a prorated portion of significant store closings 
the maximum contingent payment had the agreement been terminated early on january  would have been approximately million 
management believes the risk of incurring a contingent payment is remote 

table of contents the company and hsbc have entered into several amendments to the program agreement since in october  the company and hsbc entered into a fifth amendment to the program agreement in response to macroeconomic conditions and portfolio performance  which provided for certain changes to the allocation of risk and revenue sharing between the parties

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain judgments and estimates utilized in implementing these accounting policies are likewise discussed in each of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion sets forth the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under varying conditions and assumptions 
revenue recognition sales and the related gross margin are recorded at the time customers provide a satisfactory form of payment and take ownership of the merchandise or direct its shipment 
revenue associated with gift cards is recognized upon redemption of the card 
there are minimal accounting judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of this policy 
the company estimates the amount of goods that will be returned for a refund based on historical trends and reduces sales and gross margin by that amount 
however  given that approximately of merchandise sold is later returned and that the vast majority of merchandise returns occur within a short time after the selling transaction  the risk of the company realizing a materially different amount for sales and gross margin than reported in the consolidated financial statements is minimal 
cost of sales and inventory valuation merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the first in  first out fifo retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the cost of the inventory reflected on the consolidated balance sheet is decreased with a charge to cost of sales contemporaneous with the lowering of the retail value of the inventory on the sales floor through the use of markdowns 
hence  earnings are negatively impacted as the merchandise is being devalued with markdowns prior to the sale of the merchandise 
the areas requiring significant management judgment include setting the original retail value for the merchandise held for sale  recognizing 
table of contents merchandise for which the customer s perception of value has declined and appropriately marking the retail value of the merchandise down to the perceived value  and estimating the shrinkage that has occurred through theft during the period between physical inventory counts 
these judgments and estimates  coupled with the averaging processes within the retail method  can  under certain circumstances  produce varying financial results 
factors that can lead to different financial results include setting original retail prices for merchandise held for sale too high  failure to identify a decline in perceived value of inventories and process the appropriate retail value markdowns  and overly optimistic or overly conservative inventory shrinkage estimates 
the company believes it has the appropriate merchandise valuation and pricing controls in place to minimize the risk that its inventory values would be materially under or overvalued 
the company regularly records a provision for estimated shrinkage  thereby reducing the carrying value of merchandise inventory 
a complete physical inventory of all the company s stores and distribution facilities is performed annually  with the recorded amount of merchandise inventory being adjusted to coincide with this physical count 
the differences between the estimated amount of shrinkage and the actual amount realized have been insignificant 
the company receives vendor provided support in different forms 
when the vendor provides support for inventory markdowns  the company records the support as a reduction to cost of sales 
such support is recorded in the period that the corresponding markdowns are taken 
when the company receives inventory related support that is not designated for markdowns  the company includes this support as a reduction in cost purchases 
self insurance reserves the company self insures a substantial portion of its exposure for costs related primarily to employee medical  workers compensation and general liability 
expenses are recorded based on estimates for reported and incurred but not reported claims considering a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors  litigation costs  inflation and other assumptions 
although the company does not expect the amount it will ultimately pay to differ significantly from its estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claims experience differs significantly from the historical trends and assumptions 
depreciation and recoverability of capital assets over forty percent of the company s assets at january  are represented by investments in property and equipment 
determining appropriate depreciable lives and reasonable assumptions for use in evaluating the carrying value of capital assets requires judgments and estimates 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
land is not depreciated 
buildings and building improvements are depreciated over to years 
store fixtures are depreciated over years 
equipment utilized in stores eg  escalators and in support areas eg  distribution centers  technology and fixtures in support areas are depreciated over to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or their related lease terms  generally ranging from to years 
internally generated computer software is amortized over to years 
generally  there is no estimated salvage value at the end of the useful life of the assets 
costs incurred when constructing stores  including interest expense  are capitalized 
the company may receive allowances from landlords related to the construction 
if the landlord is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the property  then the portion of those allowances attributable to the property owned by the landlord is considered to be a deferred rent liability  whereas the corresponding capital expenditures related to that store are considered to be prepaid rent 
allowances in excess of the amounts attributable to the property owned by the landlord are considered improvement allowances and are recorded as deferred rent liabilities that are amortized over the life of the lease 
capital expenditures are also reduced when the company receives cash and allowances from merchandise vendors to fund the construction of vendor shops 

table of contents to the extent the company remodels or otherwise replaces or disposes of property and equipment prior to the end of their assigned depreciable lives  the company could realize a loss or gain on the disposition 
to the extent assets continue to be used beyond their assigned depreciable lives  no depreciation expense is being realized 
the company reassesses the depreciable lives in an effort to reduce the risk of significant losses or gains at disposition and utilization of assets with no depreciation charges 
the reassessment of depreciable lives involves utilizing historical remodel and disposition activity and forward looking capital expenditure plans 
long lived assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable  such as opening a new store near an existing store  announcing plans for a store closure  a history of store operating losses  etc 
the recoverability assessment requires judgments and estimates for future store generated cash flows 
the underlying estimates of future cash flows include assumptions about key store variables  including sales  gross margin rates  and store expenses 
leases the company leases certain stores  its distribution centers  and its administrative facilities under operating leases 
store lease agreements generally include rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and contingent rent provisions for a percentage of sales in excess of specified levels 
most of the company s lease agreements include renewal periods at the company s option 
the company recognizes rent holiday periods and scheduled rent increases on a straight line basis over the lease term beginning with the date the company takes possession of the leased space 
rent expense incurred prior to the opening of a store is charged to store pre opening costs 
the company records tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays as deferred rent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and amortizes the deferred rent over the terms of the lease to rent expense in the consolidated statements of income 
the company records rent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for contingent percentage of sales lease provisions when the company determines that it is probable that the specified levels will be reached during the fiscal year 
income and other taxes the majority of the company s net deferred tax assets of million at january  consist of federal and state nol carryforwards that will expire between and the majority of the nol carryforward is a result of the net operating losses incurred during the fiscal years ended january  and january  principally due to difficult market and macroeconomic conditions 
we have concluded  based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence that all but million of these tax benefits relating to certain state losses are more likely than not to be realized in the future 
therefore  a valuation allowance for the million has been established 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
in  this evaluation resulted in a net reduction to the reserve against state deferred tax assets of million  impacting the company s results of operations 
a similar analysis was performed in  which resulted in an additional reserve against state deferred tax assets of million 
while the company has incurred a cumulative loss over the three year period ended january   after evaluating all available evidence including past operating results  current year operating income  the macroeconomic factors contributing to the and fiscal loss  the length of the carryforward periods available and the company s forecast of future taxable income  including the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  the company concluded that it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset  net of the million valuation allowance related to state nols  will be realized 
the company will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowance in the future 
if future results are less than projected or tax planning strategies are no longer viable  then additional valuation allowance may be required to reduce the deferred tax assets which could have a material impact on the company s results of operations in the period in which it is recorded 
the company is routinely under examination by federal  state and local taxing authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes 
these examinations include questioning the timing and 
table of contents amount of deductions  the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal  state and local tax laws 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  the company often accrues for exposures related to uncertain tax positions 
the company had approximately million and million of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of january  and january   respectively 
as of january   million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would impact the effective income tax rate in any future periods 
the company continually evaluates its tax filing positions and to the extent the company prevails on audits or statutes of limitation expire  the unrecognized tax benefits could be realized 
the company files a consolidated us federal income tax return as well as state tax returns in multiple state jurisdictions 
the company has completed examinations by the internal revenue service or the statute of limitations has expired for taxable years through february  with no significant adjustments 
with respect to the state and local jurisdictions  the company has completed examinations in many jurisdictions through the same period and beyond and currently has examinations in progress for several jurisdictions 
pension plans the company sponsors a funded defined benefit cash balance pension plan pension plan and an unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan serp for certain employees of the company 
the company amended the pension plan during  freezing benefit accruals for all participants except those who have attained age and completed years of credited service as of january   who are considered to be non highly compensated employees 
in january  the company amended the pension plan to suspend future benefit accruals for all remaining participants in the plan effective march  this curtailment resulted in a gain of approximately million for the year ended january  pension expense is based on actuarial models used to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to participants and is allocated to the respective service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are reviewed annually 
the company s funding policy provides that contributions to the pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding requirement of the employee retirement income security act of the company may provide additional contributions from time to time  generally not to exceed the maximum tax deductible limitation 
the pension plan and serp are valued annually as of the company s fiscal year end balance sheet date 
the projected unit credit method is utilized in recognizing the pension liabilities 
effective january   in accordance with a new accounting pronouncement  the company changed its measurement date from november to the date of its fiscal year end 
the company elected to adopt the change in measurement date using the alternative transition method 
in accordance with the alternative transition method  the actuarial valuation provided a month projection of net periodic benefit cost to january  that resulted in a million decrease to ending retained earnings 
pension assumptions are based upon management s best estimates as of the annual measurement date 
the discount rate is primarily used in calculating the company s pension obligation  which is represented by the accumulated benefit obligation abo and the projected benefit obligation pbo and in calculating net periodic benefit expense 
the discount rate utilized is based upon pension discount curves and bond portfolio curves over a duration that is similar to the expected future cash flows of the plans as of the measurement date 
as of january   the discount rate used to calculate the abo and pbo was and for the pension plan and serp  respectively 
to the extent the discount rate increases or decreases  the company s pbo is decreased or increased  respectively 
the estimated effect of a change in the discount rate is approximately million on the pbo and approximately million on annual pension expense 
to the extent the pbo increases  the after tax effect of such increases would reduce other comprehensive income and shareholders equity 

table of contents the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is used primarily in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the company s net periodic benefit expense 
the company s estimate of the expected long term rate of return considers the historical returns on plan assets  as well as the future expectations of returns on classes of assets within the target asset allocation of the plan asset portfolio 
the assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets is the weighted average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the pbo 
the company s investment strategy is to maintain a diversified portfolio of asset classes with the primary goal of ensuring that funds are available to meet the pension plan s benefit obligations when they become due  while maintaining an appropriate level of risk 
the pension plan s target asset allocation is determined by the company s retirement committee and for the year ended january   the pension plan s target asset allocation was approximately equity  fixed income  and real estate 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized is greater than or less than the assumed rate of return  that year s annual pension expense is not affected 
rather  the gain or loss is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and would reduce or increase future pension expense over a period of approximately years 
the company s expected long term rate of return on plan assets was in the estimated effect of a change in the long term rate of return on plan assets is million on the net periodic benefit expense 
the assumed average rate of compensation increase is the average annual compensation increase expected over the remaining employment periods for the participating employees and is primarily used in calculating the pbo and net periodic benefit expense 
no assumption was used in as the pension plan was amended to suspend all future benefit accruals for all active participants 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard update related to improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
the update requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
the accounting standard update is effective for reporting periods beginning after december   except for level reconciliation disclosures which are effective for periods beginning after december  adoption of this accounting standard update as it relates to level and level fair value disclosures did not impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company does not expect the adoption of the accounting standard update related to the level reconciliation disclosures to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements on january   the company adopted a new standard that changed the accounting for transfers of financial assets 
this new standard eliminates the concept of a qualified special purpose entity  removes the scope exception from applying the accounting standards that address the consolidation of variable interest entities to qualifying special purpose entities  changes the standard for de recognizing financial assets  and requires enhanced disclosure 
the adoption of this new standard did not impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
on january   the company adopted a new standard for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity 
this new standard eliminated a mandatory quantitative approach to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity in favor of a qualitatively focused analysis and required an ongoing reassessment of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary 
the adoption of this new standard did not impact the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents on february   the company retrospectively adopted a new standard related to accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
the standard specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
the effect of the adoption is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued guidance regarding subsequent events  which was subsequently updated in february this guidance established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
in particular  this guidance sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
this guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods ending after june   and was therefore adopted by the company for the second quarter reporting 
the adoption did not have a significant impact on the subsequent events that the company reports  either through recognition or disclosure  in the consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb amended its guidance on subsequent events to remove the requirement to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events  alleviating conflicts with sec guidance 
in december  the fasb issued additional guidance on employers disclosures about the plan assets of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans 
the new disclosure requirements include a description of how investment allocation decisions are made  major categories of plan assets  valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets  the impact of measurement using significant unobservable inputs and concentrations of risk within plan assets 
the new disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for the disclosures required in accordance with this accounting standard

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk primarily arises from changes in interest rates and the us equity and bond markets 
the effects of changes in interest rates on earnings generally have been small relative to other factors that also affect earnings  such as sales and operating margins 
the company seeks to manage exposure to adverse interest rate changes through its normal operating and financing activities  and if appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
such derivative instruments can be used as part of an overall risk management program in order to manage the costs and risks associated with various financial exposures 
the company does not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
based on the company s market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at january   the company has determined that there was no material market risk exposure to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as of such date
