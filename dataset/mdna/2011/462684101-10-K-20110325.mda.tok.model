comparison of and revenues 
total revenues for were million compared with million in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in total revenues was primarily due to the global economic environment that resulted in reduced capital spending in the healthcare industry 
the impact was felt more acutely in our aesthetics business which is largely driven by discretionary spending 
we did see an impact on our domestic ophthalmology business on the capital side at the beginning of as our customers became very cautious with capital spending although there were signs of a recovery towards the end of the year  and we believe that the number of domestic ophthalmology procedures that use our consumable probe decreased during causing a drop in our recurring revenues 
our international ophthalmology business did see growth as the international markets have been faster to recover from the recession and the weak dollar has provided assistance

income taxes

contractual payment obligations our contractual payment obligations that were fixed and determinable as of january  were as follows in thousands payments due by period total and thereafter operating leases payments total contractual cash obligations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  net sales and expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience  our knowledge of economic and market factors and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenues arise from the sale of laser consoles  delivery devices  consumables and service and support activities 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon receipt of a purchase order and product shipment provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured 
shipments are generally made with free on board fob shipping point terms  whereby title passes upon shipment from our dock 
any shipments with fob receiving point terms are recorded as revenue when the shipment arrives at the receiving point 
cost is recognized as product sales revenue is recognized 
the company s sales may include post sales obligations for training or other deliverables 
for revenue arrangements such as these  we recognize revenue in accordance with the revenue recognition  multiple element arrangements section of subtopic asc when the company has objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements  it defers revenue attributable to the post sale obligations and recognizes such revenue when the obligation is fulfilled 
otherwise  the company defers all revenue related to the transaction until all elements are delivered 
revenue relating to extended warranty contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the applicable warranty contract 
we recognize repair service revenue upon completion of the work 

table of contents inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include on hand inventory physically held at the company s facility  sales demo inventory and service loaner inventory 
cost is determined on a standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out fifo method 
lower of cost or market is evaluated by considering obsolescence  excessive levels of inventory  deterioration and other factors 
adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value  if required  are made for estimated excess  obsolete or impaired inventory and are charged to cost of revenues 
factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  physical deterioration and quality issues 
revisions to these adjustments would be required if these factors differ from our estimates 
sales returns allowance and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company estimates future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance 
significant management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns allowance in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our provision for sales returns is recorded net of the associated costs 
the balance for the provision of sales returns  which is recorded to a deferred revenue account  was thousand and thousand as of january  and january   respectively 
similarly management must make estimates regarding the uncollectability of accounts receivable 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non payment by customers to the extent of amounts recorded on the balance sheet 
as of january   we had accounts receivable totaling million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
as sales levels increase the level of accounts receivable would likely also increase 
in addition  in the event that customers were to delay their payments to us  the levels of accounts receivable would likely also increase 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on past payment history with the customer  analysis of the customer s current financial condition  the aging of the accounts receivable balance  customer concentration and other known factors 
warranty 
the company accrues for estimated warranty costs upon shipment of products 
actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued 
the company s warranty policy is applicable to products which are considered defective in their performance or fail to meet the product specifications 
warranty costs are reflected in the statement of operations as cost of revenues 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
under asc  the liability method is used in accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
asc also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate annually the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
in and  we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets based on our past losses and uncertainty regarding our ability to project future taxable income 
in future periods if we are able to generate income we may reduce or eliminate the valuation allowance 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc  income taxes 
asc seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax provision that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return 
additionally  asc provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures  and transition 
under asc  an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold 
in accordance with our accounting policy  we recognize accrued interests and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
the impact on adoption of asc is more fully described in note 
table of contents accounting for stock based compensation 
the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation asc which establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s service period 
stock based compensation expense for fiscal and included compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provision of asc stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after january  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc the company recognizes compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
we determined that the black scholes option pricing model is the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value for stock options 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of share based awards  including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
recently issued and adopted accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
asu specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments in this update also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures under topic to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
asu is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
asu modifies step of the goodwill impairment test so that for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not based on an assessment of qualitative indicators that goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that impairment may exist 
asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
we do not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued asu  subsequent events topic amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements 
the amendments in the asu remove the requirement for an sec filer to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in both issued and revised financial statements 
asu became effective immediately upon issuance 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update on fair value measurement and disclosures  adding new requirements for disclosures for levels and  separate disclosures and purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level measurements and clarification of existing fair value disclosures 
this update was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   except for the requirement to provide level activity of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis  which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
other than requiring additional disclosures  adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents in october  the fasb issued asu asu addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
specifically  this guidance amends the criteria in the revenue recognition multiple element arrangements subtopic of the codification for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c estimates 
this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
in addition  this guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with the option to provide retrospective presentation for prior years 
early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we transact the majority of our business in us dollars and therefore changes in foreign currency rates will not have a significant impact on our income statement or cash flows 
however  increases in the value of the us dollar against any local currencies could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country or region  leading to reduced revenue or profitability in that country or region 
as we continue to expand our international sales  our non us dollar denominated revenue and our exposure to gains and losses on international currency transactions may increase 
our french subsidiary does transact business in its local geography in euros 
we currently do not engage in transactions to hedge against the risk of the currency fluctuation  but we may do so in the future
