table of contents which support the overall business and were previously classified in the us wholesale segment 
the functions that were reclassified include the design  production  marketing  distribution  credit  customer service  information technology and accounting departments

we made the change to our reportable segments to more closely align them with how management reviews and monitors the performance of our operating segments 
total consolidated sg a expenses and total consolidated operating income were not changed as a result of these reclassifications

us wholesale net sales decreased to million 
in  our net sales to boutique customers decreased sharply  these customers were more impacted by the challenging retail environment as they generally depend to a larger extent on external financing 
our sales to major accounts  which consist of customers such as nordstrom  bloomingdale  saks fifth avenue and neiman marcus  decreased from the prior year as these customers experienced a decline in sales of premium denim due to the economic recession 
partially offsetting these decreases was a slight increase in our sales to off price retailers of million to million 
sales to nordstrom  inc accounted for of our net sales in international net sales increased to million primarily due to increased sales to distributors in asia and europe 
our sales to customers in japan increased in as compared to because we terminated our japanese distributor in the second quarter of and established our own subsidiary  which is selling merchandise to wholesale accounts and operating three outlet stores

the us consumer direct gross margin decreased to in from in as a larger share of us consumer direct sales came from the outlet stores as compared to the full price store sales 
outlet stores sales generate lower gross margins because the merchandise is sold at a discounted price 
also causing the decrease was the expected decline of the outlet stores gross margin as we are relying more on our own outlet stores to sell slow moving merchandise and as the outlet stores now have fewer higher margin irregulars in their merchandise assortment 
us wholesale gross profit decreased to million in compared to million in  due to the decline in us wholesale net sales 
however  this segment gross margin increased to in from in  due to the continued improvements in our sourcing and production processes  including an increase in the gross margin of off price sales

international sg a increased million  or  primarily due to the expansion of our international operations 
core services sg a increased million  from million in to million in this increase is primarily attributable to executive performance based compensation 
our executive compensation program was redesigned in to condition a greater portion of executive compensation on the satisfaction of earnings targets 
our performance outpaced our earnings target by a higher rate than in also contributing to this increase is an increase in design  production  warehouse and operations accounting employees to support our overall business growth and an increase in share based compensation

these factors were the primary drivers resulting in a lower effective tax rate of in net income attributable to true religion apparel  inc and earnings per diluted share net income attributable to true religion apparel  inc was million in compared to million in  an increase of 
this increase is attributable primarily to the increase in net sales 
earnings per diluted share increased from in to in inflation historically  our operations have not been materially affected by inflation 
we cannot assure that our operations will not be affected by inflation in the future 
financial condition net cash provided by operating activities in was million 
although our net income decreased by million in as compared to  more of our expenses were for non cash items  including depreciation and stock based compensation 
therefore  our net cash provided by operating activities increased in by million as compared to million in net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in this decrease of million is primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures of million 
during  we had million in capital expenditures for the new information technology system that was implemented in the third quarter of  we did not have similar capital expenditures in our expenditures for new stores were consistent in both years 
this decrease in capital expenditures was partially offset by the business acquisition of our german joint venture assets of million in net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to net cash used of million in this increase is due to an increase in cash used for statutory tax withholding payments for stock based compensation  which was partially offset by an increase in the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation 
these increases are primarily due to an increase in the number of shares vesting and an increase in our stock price when shares vested in  which resulted in higher taxable compensation 
liquidity and capital resources our primary ongoing cash requirements are currently expected to be for our ongoing operations  capital expenditures for new branded retail stores  our expansion internationally  and information technology and other infrastructure needs 
management believes that cash flow from continuing operations and on hand cash and cash equivalents will provide adequate funds for the foreseeable working capital needs and planned capital expenditures 
over the long term  we manage our cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return  strengthen our financial position and maintain flexibility for future strategic initiatives 
we believe our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and future operating cash flows  as well as any potential future borrowing facilities  will be sufficient  for at least the next twelve months  to fund scheduled future payments and potential long term initiatives

critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the period 
our management bases its estimates on historical experience and on other factors and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights the policies management believes are critical 
for a summary of all our significant accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
sales recognition sales are recognized across all segments of the business when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  price has been fixed or is determinable  and collectability can be reasonably assured

sales are recorded net of estimates for returns  discounts  operational chargebacks and markdown allowances 
returns and allowances require 
table of contents pre approval by management and discounts are based on trade terms 
we review and refine these estimates on a quarterly basis using historical trends  seasonal results  and current economic and market conditions 
our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results 
retail store sales are recognized net of estimated returns at the time of sale to consumers 
e commerce sales of products ordered through our retail internet site known as www 
truereligionbrandjeans 
com are recognized upon estimated delivery of the shipment to the customers

revenues from licensing arrangements are recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements  generally based upon the higher of a contractually guaranteed minimum royalty levels and b a percentage of wholesale sales of licensed product by our licensees 
uncollectible accounts management evaluates our accounts receivables to assess if they will ultimately be collected 
in performing this evaluation  significant judgment is used  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for larger accounts 
based on this information  management provides a reserve for the estimated amounts believed to be uncollectible 
inventories slow moving merchandise is typically sold at prices exceeding our cost in our outlet retail stores or to wholesale customers who specialize in off price merchandise 
as of december  and  we recorded inventory impairment charges for slow moving inventory of million and million  respectively  based upon analysis of balances on hand by style  recent sales trends  projected future sales  and historical markdown trends 
stock based compensation we recognize restricted stock compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  for awards with only service conditions using the straight line method over the requisite service period of the entire award 
the requisite service period is the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for an award  which often is the vesting period 
if a portion of the restricted stock vests immediately or in another period such that the cumulative vested amount exceeds the cumulative straight line expense amount  we record compensation expense equal to at least the cumulative compensation expense of the vested amount of the restricted stock 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards with performance based conditions is recognized on an accelerated basis using the graded attribution method over the requisite service period 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
using this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we establish valuation allowances for tax benefits when we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 

table of contents fasb asc accounting for income taxes fasb asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements 
in accordance with fasb asc  we regularly evaluate the likelihood of recognizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal  state and foreign filings by considering all relevant facts  circumstances  and information available 
for those benefits that we believe it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained  we recognize the largest amount we believe is cumulatively greater than likely to be realized 
we record interest and penalties  if any  on any underpayment of income taxes as a component of provision for income taxes and selling  general and administrative expenses  respectively
