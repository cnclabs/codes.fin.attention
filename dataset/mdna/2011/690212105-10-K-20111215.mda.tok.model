overview we are a value added manufacturer of high quality  prepared frozen food products for branded retail  private label  foodservice and airline customers 
our product line includes entr es  plated meals  bulk packed meal components  pastas  soups  sauces  poultry  meat and fish specialties  and organic and vegetarian offerings 
our extensive research and development efforts  combined with our extensive catalogue of recipes and flexible manufacturing capabilities  provide customers with a one stop solution for new product ideas  formulations and product manufacturing  as well as precise replication of existing recipes 
our capabilities allow customers to outsource product development  product manufacturing and packaging  thereby avoiding significant fixed cost and variable investments in resources and equipment 
our customers include prominent nationally recognized names such as panda restaurant group  inc  jenny craig  inc  safeway inc  target corporation  pinnacle foods group llc  and american airlines  inc we also sell frozen foods under the boston market brand  under exclusive license with boston market corporation 
our goal is to continue as a leading developer and manufacturer of value added food products and provider of custom prepared frozen foods 
we intend to continue to execute our growth and operating strategies  including diversifying and expanding our customer base by focusing on sectors we believe have attractive growth characteristics  such as foodservice and retail  investing in and operating efficient production facilities  providing value added ancillary support services to customers  offering a broad range of products to customers in multiple channels of distribution  and exploring strategic acquisitions and investments 
despite reduced sales in virtually all of our sectors and a generally weak economy we remained profitable with net revenues of million and net income of million for fiscal year sales during fiscal year reflected the impact of a continued weak economy  failing consumer confidence and reduced demand 
most of our customers have experienced decreased sales and in turn have reduced their orders as they manage lower inventory levels 
we have also incurred costs related to the launch of new products for the boston market line and for target corporation target 
fiscal year revenue includes some early target and boston market pipeline sales which began in july as part of these two major launches  during the second half of fiscal year we increased headcount by an average of temporary production employees and incurred significant overtime expenses as we built an inventory pipeline for the two product lines 

table of contents like most companies  we unfortunately expect to continue to face headwinds related to the economy  including higher fuel and commodity costs and sluggish consumer demand 
in an effort to offset these ongoing challenges and to improve operating margins  we continue to aggressively seek new business opportunities and to closely monitor all categories of operating expenses 
we believe one of our core strengths has been our ability to mitigate rising food costs through strategic forward buying 
we expect that this strength will again play a positive role in our future operations 
additionally  as customer contracts come to renewal and as other opportunities develop  we intend to take advantage of improved product pricing 
also  in an effort to expedite the recovery of retail sales to existing customers  we have been working with our major existing retail accounts to refresh product lines and to introduce additional lines of products 
with these new products and lines for our existing customers  as well as anticipated increases from our recently added boston market and target products  we are optimistic for future retail sales 
fiscal year was a week period while and were week periods 
for fiscal year  net revenues of million reflected a decrease as compared to fiscal year during fiscal year  decreased sales in virtually all categories contributed to the decline 
we experienced a decrease in net revenues for fiscal year  to million  compared to million for fiscal year the decrease in net revenues during fiscal year was due to decreased sales in the retail and airline categories 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  as previously reported  we entered into a co manufacturing  sales and distribution agreement the agreement with bellisio foods  inc bellisio 
the agreement covers a collaborative arrangement between us and bellisio regarding the co manufacture  sale and distribution of boston market products 
the agreement provides that we and bellisio will each manufacture approximately of the total production volume of current and future boston market products during the term of the agreement 
we began manufacturing boston market products in june  and bellisio began its manufacturing of boston marketing products in august  gross profit was million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year gross profit as a percentage of net revenues  or gross margin  during fiscal years  and were  and  respectively 
the gross margin decrease was driven largely by higher variable overhead costs as a percentage of net revenues  a less favorable sales mix and higher conversion costs  specifically higher unfavorable indirect labor variances as a result of smaller production runs that were required to manage lower customer order levels 
in addition  freight and storage expenses increased  primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal year for fiscal year compared to fiscal year  due predominantly to increased shipments for boston market products and higher fuel surcharges 
gross profit also decreased due to  in slotting fees and our share of other start up costs  related to boston market products 
we also had start up costs of  related to the test run and initial launch of the boston market brand 
in addition  experienced less favorable commodity prices compared to the same period last year due to increases in the cost of certain commodities 
although we see indications of inflation on commodities for the rest of calendar year and the beginning of  we plan to mitigate increases with forward buying and pricing opportunities where appropriate 
the decrease in gross profit in fiscal year compared to was due to lower net revenues and increased investment spending to achieve certification under the global food safety management system standard fssc towards the end of the third quarter of fiscal year  safeway inc changed its in store sales and marketing model thereby eliminating its previous brokerage arrangement 
as a result  we are no longer paying brokerage to an independent third party but now pay safeway inc  which is recorded as a reduction to net revenues rather than as a selling  general and administrative sg a expense and thus adversely affects gross margin 
the additional amount recorded as a reduction to net revenues rather than as sg a  for fiscal year  was  operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal year was compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year  due primarily to decreased gross profit and increased selling  general and administrative sg a expenses

there were also increases in personnel related expenses  data processing expense  and travel expense 
there was also an increase in amortization expense as we took a  impairment charge due to the write off of the better living brands tm alliance alliance license fee intangible asset 
these increases were offset by a reduction in brokerage expense to safeway inc of  as it changed its in store sales marketing model thereby eliminating its previous brokerage arrangement 
as a result  we are no longer paying brokerage to an independent third party but now pay safeway inc directly  which is recorded as a reduction to net revenues rather than sg a 
in addition we reduced our legal expense by  due to the conclusion of various legal proceedings 
net income decreased as a percentage of net revenues to in fiscal year versus in fiscal year and in fiscal year 
table of contents as described under liquidity and capital resources below  during fiscal year we refinanced our then existing debt with guggenheim corporate funding  llc gcf by entering into a new credit facility with bank of america  na 
the bank of america facility is a million three year senior secured credit facility that is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets 
in september we made an initial loan drawdown of million under the bank of america facility  the proceeds of which were used to pay off our debt to gcf 
in fiscal year  we paid off a net amount of million million in voluntary payments offset by million in new borrowings on our bank of america facility  leaving us with a balance of million

table of contents net revenues 
net revenues for fiscal year decreased million to million from million for fiscal year  due to lower sales volume  a less favorable sales mix resulting from a lower percentage of retail and foodservice sales  decreases in retail and food service net revenues  partially offset by a small increase in airline net revenues 
retail net revenues decreased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the decrease in retail net revenues was largely due to the previously disclosed reduced volume from h 
j 
heinz company  which resulted in a million decline in sales for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the remaining decrease in retail net revenues is attributable to a million decline in sales to safeway inc and a million decline to jenny craig  inc these declines were partially offset by net revenues related to the sale of boston market products sold to various third party customers totaling million and million in sales to target corporation 
a majority of the boston market net revenues were for pipeline sales as we were required to produce of the boston market products until bellisio started its production in mid august 
as of october   our cases accounted for approximatly of the total boston market products sold 
going forward  our boston market products should account for approximately of the total boston market products sold  in accordance with the agreement noted in exhibit of this report 
for fiscal year  the retail category as a percentage of net revenues increased to from for fiscal year due to boston market product sales 
foodservice net revenues decreased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year due primarily to a million reduction in sales to panda restaurant group inc for fiscal year  the foodservice category as a percentage of net revenues decreased to from for fiscal year notwithstanding the decline  we continue to increase our sales efforts in this category and believe that foodservice represents a significant opportunity for us in and beyond 
airline net revenues increased  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year due to increased sales to an existing customer stemming from new products we have developed for them 
however  due to continuing airline industry initiatives to cut cost  airline net revenues are not likely to increase again and may decrease in future periods 
for fiscal year  the airline category as a percentage of net revenues increased to from for fiscal year subsequent to october  american airlines  inc  a major airline customer  filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
however  american airlines  inc  has assured its suppliers that it will use its large cash surplus to conduct business as usual 
as of the date of this filing  all receivables outstanding from american airlines  inc through its distributors  as of october  have been collected 
all receivables outstanding for sales subsequent to october  are current and considered fully collectible 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal year decreased million to million from million for fiscal year the decrease in gross profit dollars was due to lower sales volume as well as a less favorable sales mix resulting from lower retail sales 
gross margin decreased to for fiscal years from for fiscal year due to higher variable overhead costs as a percentage of net revenues  a less favorable sales mix and higher conversion costs  specifically higher unfavorable indirect labor variances and higher variable overhead cost as a result of smaller production runs that were required to manage lower customer order levels 
in addition  freight and storage expenses increased  primarily all in the fourth quarter of fiscal year for fiscal year compared to fiscal year  due predominantly to increased shipments for boston market products and higher fuel surcharges 
we anticipate continued increased freight and storage expenses as sales volumes for boston market continue to grow and if fuel prices increase 
gross profit also decreased due to  in slotting fees and our share of other start up costs  at the bellisio factory related to boston market products 
we also had start up costs of  related to the test run and initial launch of the boston market brand 
we also experienced less favorable commodity prices compared to fiscal year due to increases in the cost of certain commodities such as beef  dairy and soybean oil 
although we see indications of inflation on commodities for the rest of calendar year and the beginning of  we plan to mitigate increases with forward buying and pricing opportunities where appropriate 
towards the end of the third quarter of fiscal year  safeway inc changed its in store sales and marketing model thereby eliminating its previous brokerage arrangement 
as a result  we are no longer paying brokerage to an independent third party but now pay safeway inc  which is recorded as a reduction to net revenues rather than as a selling  general and administrative sg a expense and thus adversely affects gross margin 
the additional amount recorded as a reduction to net revenues rather than as sg a  for fiscal year  was  selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses increased  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year sg a expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year the increase in sg a expenses was due to  in recurring marketing  brokerage  and royalty related expenses for the boston market brand incurred primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 
there were also increases in personnel related expenses  data processing expenses  for compliance with xbrl mandates and travel expense 
these increases were offset by a reduction in brokerage expense to safeway inc of  as it changed its in store sales marketing model thereby eliminating its previous brokerage arrangement 
as a result  we are no longer paying brokerage to an independent third party but now pay safeway inc directly  which is recorded as a reduction to net revenues rather than sg a 
in addition  we reduced our legal expense by  due to the conclusion of various legal proceedings 

table of contents in addition  during fiscal year  we made one time payments for pre launch sales activities  including  for start up management fees and  for start up brokerage fees to bellisio and also had one time start up marketing expenses  including package design  website development and retail store material design and production of  stemming from the launch of the boston market product line 
there was also an increase in amortization expense as we took a  impairment charge due to the write off of the better living brands tm alliance alliance license fee intangible asset 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the alliance lost distribution and recorded no sales through the date of this report 
therefore  as of october   the company determined that the license agreement with the alliance had been fully impaired and recorded an impairment charge of  bringing the asset value to zero 
during the first eleven months of fiscal year and prior fiscal years under the licensing agreement  sales and future discounted cash flows to the alliance did not signify any impairment indications 
although there might be future revenue associated with the license agreement through the end of the original term  the company determined that any future discounted cash flows would not substantiate a carrying value for the asset 
excluding the one time items  we expect sg a expense to increase as we continue to contest remaining claims and grievances as described in part i  item of this report and as we incur additional selling expenses  specifically royalty expenses  as volume increases for boston market products

net income 
net income for fiscal year was million  or per basic and diluted shares  compared to net income of million  or per basic and per diluted share for fiscal year we currently expect to continue profitable operations primarily through a growing revenues from profitable product lines  increasing our customer base and replacing lower margin accounts  b improving gross margins by increasing prices to customers where appropriate  streamlining additional costs and continuing to leverage our manufacturing and storage facilities to improve manufacturing efficiency  and c reducing future interest costs on outstanding debt through pre payments on our debt 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be successful in any of these initiatives 
however  as discussed in risk factors contained in item a of this report  we may be unable to improve our operating results  and could perhaps even operate at a loss  if we suffer a decline in our manufacturing efficiency  the loss of major customers  continued cost cutting measures in the airline industry  adverse changes in our operating costs or raw materials costs or other adverse changes to our business

there have been no other material changes to our obligations as of december  recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued an update to its authoritative guidance regarding the methods used to test goodwill for impairment 
the amendment allows the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test currently required 
under that option  an entity would no longer be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on that qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
if an entity concludes otherwise  then it must perform the two step impairment test currently required 
we will adopt this guidance commencing in fiscal year  effective october   and apply it prospectively 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that revised its requirements related to the presentation of comprehensive income 
this guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive oci as part of the consolidated statement of equity 
it requires presentation of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
we will adopt this guidance commencing in fiscal year  effective october   and apply it retrospectively 
in may  the fasb issued an update to its authoritative guidance regarding fair value measurements to clarify disclosure requirements and improve comparability 
additional disclosure requirements include a for level fair value measurements  quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used  qualitative information about the sensitivity of the measurements to change in the unobservable inputs disclosed including the interrelationship between inputs  and a description of the company s valuation processes  b all  not just significant  transfers between level and of the fair value hierarchy  c the reason why  if applicable  the current use of a nonfinancial asset measured at fair value differs from its highest and best use  d the categorization in the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments not measured at fair value but for which disclosure of fair value is required 
the company will adopt this guidance commencing in the second quarter of fiscal  effective january   and apply it retrospectively 

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
see note to the financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are related to our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
concentrations of credit risk 
our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables 
we perform on going credit evaluations of each customer s financial condition and generally require no collateral from our customers 
a bankruptcy or other significant financial deterioration of any customer could impact its future ability to satisfy its receivables with us 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based primarily upon historical bad debt experience and current market conditions 
bad debt expense and accounts receivable write offs  net of recoveries  historically have been relatively small  as we generally transact the substantial portion of our business with large  established food or service related businesses 
for fiscal years  and  our write offs  net of recoveries  to the allowance for doubtful accounts were approximately   and  respectively 
a significant portion of our total net revenues and receivables during the last two fiscal years were derived from three and four customers  respectively  as described below net revenues customer october  september  jenny craig  inc panda restaurant group  inc safeway inc receivables customer october  september  panda restaurant group  inc through its distributors jenny craig  inc safeway inc bellisio foods  inc for various third party customers inventories 
inventories  which include material  labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  which approximates the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
we use a standard costing system to estimate our fifo cost of inventory at the end of each reporting period 
historically  standard costs have been materially consistent with actual costs 
we periodically review our inventory for excess items  and write it down based upon the age of specific items in inventory and the expected recovery from the disposition of the items 
we write down our inventory for the estimated aged surplus  spoiled or damaged products and discontinued items and components 
we determine the amount of the write down by analyzing inventory composition  expected usage  historical and projected sales information and other factors 
changes in sales volume due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that could result in material increases in the write down of our inventory 
property and equipment 
the cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets  which range from three to ten years 
leasehold improvements to our plant no 
in vernon  california are amortized over the lesser of the initial lease term plus one lease extension period  initially totaling years  or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
other leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
depreciation is generally computed using the straight line method 

table of contents we assess property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
the cost of materials purchased and labor expended in betterments and major renewals are capitalized 
costs and related accumulated depreciation of properties sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts  and gains or losses on disposals are included in operating income 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill at least annually for impairment 
we have one reporting unit and estimate fair value based on a variety of market factors  including discounted cash flow analysis  market capitalization  and other market based data 
at october   we had goodwill of million 
a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect could decrease the estimated fair value of our business and  thus  cause our goodwill to become impaired and cause us to record a charge against operations in an amount representing the impairment 
income taxes 
we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets based on whether we believe that it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets will be realized 
we consider future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a charge to income at that time 
we adopted the provisions of fasb guidance on accounting for uncertainty of income taxes on october  the guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements in accordance with the standard on accounting for income taxes 
this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
it also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits  classification on the balance sheet  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
as a result of the implementation of the guidance  we recorded no increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  and the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was zero at october  we have also adopted the accounting policy that interest and penalties recognized are classified as part of income taxes 
no interest and penalties were recognized in the statement of income for fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk obligations 
we are subject to interest rate risk on variable interest rate obligations 
a hypothetical increase in average market interest rates would increase by approximately  the annual interest expense on our debt outstanding as of october
