overview we are a profitable and growing specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition  development and commercialization of branded prescription products 
cumberland is dedicated to providing innovative products which improve quality of care for patients 
our primary target markets are hospital acute care and gastroenterology  which are characterized by relatively concentrated 
table of contents part ii physician prescriber bases that we believe can be penetrated effectively with relatively small  targeted sales forces 
our product portfolio includes caldolor ibuprofen injection  the first injectable treatment for pain and fever approved in the united states  acetadote acetylcysteine injection for the treatment of acetaminophen poisoning and kristalose lactulose for oral solution  a prescription laxative 
we market our products through our dedicated hospital and gastroenterology sales forces in the united states  and work to partner our products to reach international markets 
we have both product development and commercial capabilities  and believe we can leverage our existing infrastructure to support our expected growth 
our management team consists of pharmaceutical industry veterans experienced in business development  clinical and regulatory affairs  and sales and marketing 
our internal product development and regulatory executives develop proprietary product formulations  design and manage our clinical trials  prepare all regulatory submissions and manage our medical call center 
our products are manufactured by third parties  which are overseen and managed by cumberland s quality control and manufacturing group 
all aspects of commercialization are handled by our sales and marketing professionals  and we work closely with our distribution partner to make our products available across the united states 
our strategy to grow our company includes maximizing the potential of our existing products and continuing to build a portfolio of new  differentiated products 
all of our current products are approved for sale in the united states  and acetadote is approved for sale in australia 
we are expanding our partner base outside of the us to bring our products to select international markets 
we also look for opportunities to expand into additional patient populations through new product indications  whether through proprietary clinical studies or by supporting investigator initiated studies at reputable research institutions 
we are actively pursuing opportunities to acquire additional late stage development product candidates as well as marketed products in our target medical specialties 
further  we are supplementing the aforementioned growth strategies with the early stage drug development activities of cet  our majority owned subsidiary 
cet partners with universities and other research organizations to cost effectively develop promising  early stage product candidates  which cumberland has the opportunity to commercialize 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations can result from competitive factors  new product acquisitions or introductions  the nature  scope and result of our research and development programs  execution of our growth strategy and other factors 
as a result of these fluctuations  our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
highlights and recent developments acetadote submission of application for new formulation of acetadote in october  we submitted a supplemental new drug application snda to the us food and drug administration fda for approval of a new formulation of acetadote  which was the result of a phase iv commitment cumberland made to the fda upon receipt of initial marketing approval of the product 
in january  the fda approved the new formulation  which does not contain ethylene diamine tetracetic acid or any other stabilization and chelating agents and is free of preservatives 
we have commenced us launch activities for this next generation product  which will replace the currently marketed product 
we will no longer manufacture the previously approved formulation for the us market and the original formulation has been delisted 
we have provided a request to the fda that they not approve a generic to the previous formulation and documented that the new formulation was developed based on their phase iv requirement 
we have also filed a patent application with the us patent and trademark office to protect the proprietary new formulation 

table of contents part ii supplemental new drug application for acetadote in march  we submitted a snda to the fda for the use of acetadote in patients with non acetaminophen acute liver failure 
the snda includes data from a clinical trial led by investigators at the university of texas southwestern medical center indicating that acute liver failure patients treated with acetadote have a significantly improved chance of survival without a transplant 
the study showed that these patients can also survive a significant number of days longer without transplant  which would provide patients requiring transplant increased time for a donor organ to become available 
in may  the fda officially accepted the snda and granted a priority review with a response expected in september in august  we announced that the fda extended its review of the snda by three months  resulting in a new prescription drug user fee act pdufa goal date in december in december  the fda issued a complete response letter indicating that it had completed its review of the application and had identified additional work required or items that must be addressed prior to approval of the potential new indication 
we are currently in discussion with the fda to gain clarity on the pathway to approval for this important indication 
launch of acetadote in australia in april  the therapeutic goods administration granted approval to our partner phebra pty ltd  an australian based specialty pharmaceutical company  for the commercialization of acetadote in australia 
in october  phebra commenced with the australian launch of acetadote and began promoting wide distribution of the product 
this introduction of acetadote in australia marked cumberland s entry into international markets 
in addition to australia  phebra has exclusive marketing rights to acetadote for new zealand and has obtained marketing approval in that country 
phebra is also our marketing partner for acetadote in certain asia pacific markets  and continues to work toward obtaining approval for the product in those areas 
caldolor in june  the fda approved caldolor  our intravenous formulation of ibuprofen  for marketing in the united states through a priority review 
in september  we implemented the us launch of caldolor with our experienced sales professionals promoting the product across the country 
caldolor is fully stocked at the wholesalers serving hospitals nationwide  available in both mg and mg vials 
in  we focused our sales and marketing efforts primarily on securing formulary approval nationally for caldolor  and the product is now stocked at a growing number of us medical facilities 
in early  we began transitioning some of our sales and marketing resources to also drive pull through sales for the product 
we expect those activities to generate greater use of the product in submission of marketing application in south korea in december  we entered into an exclusive partnership with db pharm korea co 
ltd  a korean based pharmaceutical company  for the commercialization of caldolor in south korea 
under the terms of the agreement  db pharm korea is responsible for obtaining any regulatory approval for the product and handling ongoing regulatory requirements  product marketing  distribution and sales in korea

table of contents part ii manufacturing 
in exchange for the license to the product  cumberland will receive royalties on future sales of caldolor in addition to upfront and milestone payments as well as a transfer price 
compassionate use in australia in december  we entered into an exclusive agreement with phebra pty ltd 
for distribution of caldolor in australia and new zealand 
in april  phebra made the product available in australia on a limited  compassionate use basis 
the tga  which regulates drugs and medical devices in australia  operates compassionate use programs that allow patients with critical clinical needs to access products not yet approved through their medical practitioner

other developments new board of directors appointments in april  we added three new members to our board of directors when cumberland shareholders elected gordon r 
bernard  md  jonathan griggs and james jones at our annual meeting 
in january  joey jacobs also joined our board of directors 
we believe each new director brings significant experience in an area critical to our company s continued growth and success 
amendment of senior credit facility in september  we amended our senior credit facility with bank of america 
with this amendment  we reduced the outstanding balance on our term loan from million to million on an original term loan of million 
we also expanded our line of credit to million  which increases our access to funding for future growth 
we expect to achieve a net interest savings by retiring debt with cash that would have earned a much lower yield 
the debt repayment  which was funded with excess cash flow  is consistent with our efforts to efficiently manage our capital resources 
share repurchase program in may  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of cumberland s outstanding common stock 
pursuant to the share repurchase program  we are purchasing shares of our common stock from time to time on the open market 
the timing and amount of purchases are determined by us based on evaluation of market conditions  stock price and other factors 
for the period from january  to march   we had repurchased an additional  shares  or million  of our common stock under this program 
in january  our board of directors modified the existing repurchase program to provide for the repurchase of million of our outstanding common stock  in addition to the amount repurchased in federal grant funding in november  cumberland was awarded  in federal grant funding under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project  a us healthcare reform initiative designed to support promising research and development programs at small life sciences firms 
transfer of license rights as previously reported  cet has entered into an agreement with vanderbilt university to in license rights to a new product candidate 
in the third quarter of  cumberland pharmaceuticals entered into an option agreement with cet to assume the rights and responsibilities associated with that product 
table of contents part ii candidate 
since then  we have commenced product manufacturing and submitted an investigational new drug application for the clinical evaluation of this product candidate 
this transferring of product rights from cet to cumberland is consistent with our goals in establishing cet to give us access to an early stage development product pipeline 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates accounting estimates and judgments the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
we base our estimates on past experience and on other factors we deem reasonable given the circumstances 
past results help form the basis of our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not determined from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are most critical with respect to our accounting for revenue recognition  provision for income taxes  stock based compensation  research and development accounting  and intangible assets 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
together  sab  and topic of the accounting standards codification 
our revenue is derived primarily from the product sales of acetadote  caldolor and kristalose 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is probable 
delivery is considered to have occurred upon either shipment of the product or arrival at its destination based on the shipping terms of the transaction 
when these conditions are satisfied  we recognize gross product revenue  which is the price we charge generally to our wholesalers for a particular product 
other income  which is a component of net revenues  includes rental and grant income 
other income was less than three percent of net revenues in  and less than one percent in and our net product revenue reflects the reduction of gross product revenue at the time of initial sales recognition for estimated accounts receivable allowances for chargebacks  discounts and damaged product as well as provisions for sales related accruals of rebates  product returns and administrative fees and fee for services 
our financial statements reflect accounts receivable allowances of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively  for chargebacks  discounts and allowances for product damaged in shipment 
we had accrued liabilities of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively  for rebates  product returns  service fees  and administrative fees 
the following table reflects our sales related accrual activity balance at january current provision current provision for prior period sales actual returns credits balance at december 
table of contents part ii the allowances for chargebacks  discounts  and damaged products and sales related accruals for rebates and product returns are determined on a product by product basis and are established by management as our best estimate at the time of sale based on each product s historical experience  adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such allowances and accruals 
additionally  these allowances and accruals are established based on the following the contractual terms with customers  analysis of historical levels of discounts  returns  chargebacks and rebates  communications with customers  purchased information about the rate of prescriptions being written and the level of inventory remaining in the distribution channel  if known  and expectations about the market for each product  including any anticipated introduction of competitive products 
the allowances for chargebacks and accruals for rebates and product returns are the most significant estimates used in the recognition of our revenue from product sales 
of the accounts receivable allowances and our sales related accruals  our accrual for fee for services and product returns represent the majority of the balance 
sales related accrued liabilities totaled million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
of these amounts  our estimated liability for fee for services represented million  million and million  respectively  while our accrual for product returns totaled million  million and million  respectively 
if the actual amount of cash discounts  chargebacks  rebates  and product returns differ from the amounts estimated by management  material differences may result from the amount of our revenue recognized from product sales 
a change in our rebate estimate of one percentage point would have impacted net sales by approximately million in each of the three years ended december  a change in our product return estimate of one percentage point would have impacted net sales by million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
any expired product return would be from a prior period  given the shelf life of the products 
as a general rule  we do not allow customers to purchase additional product prior to a scheduled price increase 
we occasionally make an exception to this policy when we offer odd lot quantities at a slightly reduced price or when a customer opens a new facility and requests special terms on their initial purchase 
to date  we believe these types of transactions have not been material 
moreover  when we offer special terms  we review the transaction against our revenue recognition policy for proper treatment 
if we determine such transactions become material  we will disclose the impact in the notes to our financial statements 
while we do not have regular access to our customers inventory levels  we review each order from all of our customers 
to the extent that an order reflects more than a normal purchasing pattern  management discusses the order with the customer prior to agreeing to process the order 
income taxes we provide for deferred taxes using the asset and liability approach 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
our principal differences are related to the timing of deductibility of certain items such as depreciation  amortization and expense for options issued to nonemployees 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using management s estimate of tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which management believes those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a 
table of contents part ii change in tax rates is recognized in our results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the tax benefit associated with the exercise of nonqualified stock options is recognized when the benefit is used to offset income taxes payable 
as of december   we have unrecognized federal net operating loss carryforwards associated with the exercise of nonqualified options of million 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
in addition  incremental compensation expense is recognized upon the modification  cancellation or repurchase of equity awards 
the fair value of stock options and warrants are calculated using the black scholes option pricing model on the date of grant 
we estimate volatility in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
as there was no public market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering and  therefore  a lack of company specific historical or implied volatility data  we have determined the share price volatility based on an analysis of certain publicly traded companies that we consider to be our peers 
the comparable peer companies used for our estimated volatility are publicly traded companies with operations which we believe to be similar to ours 
when identifying companies as peers  we consider such characteristics as the type of industry  size and or type of product s  research and or product development capabilities  and stock based transactions 
we intend to continue to consistently estimate our volatility in this manner until sufficient historical information regarding the volatility of our own shares becomes available  or circumstances change such that the identified entities are no longer similar to us 
in this latter case  we would utilize other similar entities whose share prices are publicly available 
we estimate the expected life of employee share options based on the simplified method allowed by sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
under this approach  the expected term is presumed to be the average between the weighted average vesting period and the contractual term 
the expected term for options granted to nonemployees is generally the contractual term of the option 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury note  stripped principal  on the date of grant with a term substantially equal to the corresponding option s expected term 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends nor do we plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of employee options granted during  and dividend yield expected term in years expected volatility risk free interest rate 
table of contents part ii the following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of nonemployee options granted during  and dividend yield expected term in years expected volatility risk free interest rate research and development we account for research and development costs and accrue expenses based on estimates of work performed  patient enrollment or fixed fee for services 
as work is performed and or invoices are received  we adjust our estimates and accruals 
to date  our accruals have been within our estimates 
total research and development costs are a function of studies being conducted and will increase or decrease depending on the level of activity in any particular year 
intangible assets intangible assets include license agreements  product rights and other identifiable intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in determining the recoverability of our intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the intangible assets  we must determine the fair value of the intangible assets 
if the fair value of the intangible assets is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including quoted market prices  third party independent appraisals and discounted cash flow models  as considered necessary

year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues for totaled approximately million  representing an increase of approximately million  or  over the same period in net revenue increased million for acetadote and decreased million and million for kristalose and caldolor  respectively 
the increase in acetadote revenue was positively impacted by a increase in volume and an increase in the average selling price  offset by an increase in fee for service deductions due to additional arrangements with our wholesalers 
while kristalose gross revenue increased  net revenue was impacted by an increase in the gross to net revenue deductions primarily associated with rebates and expired product returns 
additionally  in the third quarter of  we completed the commercial launch of caldolor  and recognized million of net revenue in our sales forces continue to maintain a consistent level of focus on acetadote and kristalose while they progress the promotion of caldolor 
in  we focused our sales and marketing efforts primarily on securing formulary approval and stocking nationally for caldolor 
during the first quarter of  we initiated a shift in focus and began transitioning part of our sales and marketing resources to driving pull through use of caldolor in facilities stocking the product 
in  we recognized approximately million in federal grant funding from the qualifying therapeutic discovery project  a component of the healthcare reform legislation enacted in cost of products sold 
cost of products sold as a percentage of net revenues decreased from for to for the same period in this decrease was primarily due to the sales mix in the periods 
kristalose is manufactured by inalco 
in  inalco sold its facility that manufactured the api for kristalose 
we are currently in discussions with inalco regarding supply prices for we expect cost of products sold for kristalose to increase 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expense for totaled approximately million  representing an increase of approximately million  or  over the same period in the increase was primarily due to the expansion of our hospital sales force during the third quarter of  and the resulting increases in payroll and related taxes  travel  meals and promotional activities 
these increases were offset by a decrease in marketing  advertising and hiring expenses related to caldolor in as compared to the significant investment made in related to the launch 
research and development 
research and development expense for totaled approximately million  representing a decrease of approximately million  or  over the same period in the decrease was primarily due to the inclusion in of approximately million of milestone expenses incurred upon the fda approval of caldolor in june this decrease was offset by additional costs incurred in related to annual fda product and establishment fees  increased salary and related expenses resulting from an increase in personnel and increased costs related to furthering our development efforts for our products and product candidates 
research and development expense is expected to increase in as we pursue more clinical studies for our products and product candidates 
as a part of our phase iv commitments to the fda  we have initiated two multi center trials evaluating caldolor for treatment of pain and fever in pediatric patients 
in addition  we have initiated two new registry studies related to the administration of caldolor  primarily related to the rapid infusion of caldolor to patients 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense for totaled approximately million  representing an increase of approximately million  or  over the same period in 
table of contents part ii the increase is primarily due to additional expenses associated with being an sec registrant  including legal  accounting and insurance costs 
interest income

income tax expense for totaled approximately million  representing an increase of approximately million  over the same period in as a percentage of income before income taxes  income tax expense increased from for the year ended december  to for the same period in the increase in the percentage was primarily due to research and development expenses utilized in the therapeutic discovery tax credit not being deductible for federal income tax purposes  an increase in stock compensation expense that is not deductible for income tax purposes and an increase in nondeductible meals and entertainment expenses associated with the expansion of our sales force 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues for totaled million  representing an increase of million  or  over the same period in of this increase  approximately million related to acetadote  related to the launch of caldolor and million related to kristalose 
the remaining increase was due to increased grant and rental revenue 
the increase in revenues for acetadote was primarily due to increased volume as our products continued to grow in our target markets 
gross product sales were reduced by million and million in and  respectively 
in  this reduction included million for damaged and expired product returns  million for cash discounts  million related to fee for service costs and million for estimated rebates  chargebacks and discounts related to our products

table of contents part ii hiring expense increased million 
we expect selling and marketing expense to increase in as we continue our efforts to promote our products 
research and development 
research and development expense for totaled million  representing an increase of million  or  over the increase was primarily due to approximately million in milestone expenses associated with the fda approval of caldolor 
this expense was partially offset by reduced studies costs in as compared to noting included million for the new drug application fee associated with caldolor 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense for totaled million  representing an increase of million  or  over the same period in the increase was primarily due to increased payroll tax expense of million associated with the employer s portion of payroll taxes that resulted from the exercise of nonqualified options 
additionally  we incurred increased salary and bonus expense of million as we continue to increase our infrastructure  increased stock compensation expense of million  increased d o insurance expense of million for additional public company coverage  increased consulting expense of million and increased bank service charges of million 
the additional payroll tax expense of million noted above resulted from the exercise of approximately million nonqualified options held by employees 
as of december   employees held  nonqualified options with a weighted average exercise price of per share for which we are required to pay payroll related taxes upon exercise  provided the holder is still an employee at the time of exercise 
if all outstanding nonqualified options held by employees were exercised at december   the maximum exposure to us would have been approximately million 
interest income 
interest income totaled million for  representing a decrease of million  or  over the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates throughout interest expense 
interest expense totaled million for  representing an increase of million  or  over the increase was primarily due to additional borrowings during in july  we amended our loan agreement to provide for an million term loan and a million line of credit

as of december  and  our cash and cash equivalents was million and million  respectively  working capital current assets minus current liabilities was million and million  respectively  and our current ratio current assets to current liabilities was x and x 
as of december  and  we also had the ability to make additional draws of up to approximately million and million  respectively  on our line of credit 
the information included in footnote to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k is hereby incorporated by reference into this item 

table of contents part ii the following table summarizes our net changes in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents the sum of the individual amounts may not agree due to rounding 
the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million for year ended december  was primarily due to cash used in financing activities  which included principal payments on our term debt of million and the repurchase of common stock of approximately million 
these expenditures were offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of approximately million and the excess tax benefit derived from the exercise of nonqualified options of approximately million 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily due to net income for the period and the collection of accounts receivable offset by the purchase of inventory  the decrease in accounts payable and the excess tax benefit derived from the exercise of stock options 
the excess tax benefit represents the income taxes that would have been paid if not for the tax deductions created upon the exercise of nonqualified stock options 
we expect to pay minimal income taxes in due to the continued usage of the unrecognized tax benefit related to the excess tax deduction described in footnote to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to the net cash proceeds from our initial public offering in august of million and additional debt proceeds of million  offset by the repurchase of common shares of million associated with the tendering of shares to settle the minimum statutory tax withholding requirement resulting from the exercise of nonqualified options by an employee 
in addition  we received a tax benefit of approximately million related to nonqualified options exercised in the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to cash generated from operations offset by cash paid for our million share repurchase 
in july  we amended our debt agreement with bank of america  na the fourth amended and restated loan agreement to provide for million in term debt and a million revolving credit facility  both with an interest rate of libor plus an applicable margin based on the company s leverage ratio  as defined in the agreement 
the interest rate at december  was per annum 
in addition  we were required to pay a commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the commitment 
the term debt was payable in quarterly installments of million beginning on march  and continuing until december  the revolving credit facility was due on december  we may be required to make additional principal payments on the term debt if the leverage ratio  as defined  exceeds to on an annual basis 
the borrowings were collateralized by a first lien against all of the company s assets 
the proceeds from the term debt were restricted for the payment  in part  of the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements of approximately million due from option holders who exercised options to purchase shares of our common stock at the pricing of the company s initial public offering 
the consideration for that 
table of contents part ii payment was the transfer to the company of shares acquired upon exercise at the then current fair market value of the company s common stock 
in connection with the amendment of the debt agreement  we capitalized approximately million of debt issue costs  of which million related to the fair value of common stock and million related to the fair value of warrants issued to the lender 
deferred financing costs were being expensed to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the debt agreement 
the fourth amended and restated loan agreement contained restrictive covenants  which we were in compliance with during and the fourth amended and restated loan agreement required us to make an additional principal payment within days after the end of the fiscal year in an amount equal to its excess cash flow  as defined in the agreement 
the additional principal payment of million  which was included as a current portion of long term debt in the consolidated balance sheet at december   was paid during the first quarter of in september  we further amended our loan agreement with bank of america  na the agreement 
the amendment provided for an increase in the availability under the existing line of credit from million to million  with interest payable monthly at libor plus an applicable margin  as defined in the agreement at december  
in addition  the term debt was reduced to million  with quarterly payments under the term debt reduced to  plus interest at the same rate as the line of credit  beginning december  we reduced the commitment fee from three quarters of one percent to one half of one percent per annum on the unused line of credit 
the borrowings are collateralized by a first priority lien on all of our assets 
concurrent with the amendment of the agreement  we elected to prepay approximately million of its term debt  incurring a prepayment penalty of approximately million 
at december   the outstanding term loan and line of credit balances were million and million  respectively 
the agreement s covenants include a leverage ratio  as defined in the agreement  of to for the quarter ended december   to for each of the three quarters ended march   june  and september  and to for quarter ending december  and thereafter  as well as a fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the agreement  of at least to at each quarter annual reporting period 
in addition  we must maintain deposits with bank of america  na at amounts equal to at least the sum of a the maximum amount of the line of credit plus b the aggregate principal amount then outstanding under the term debt 
we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants at december  we are subject to additional loan fees if certain performance metrics measured at march  and september  are not met 
if required  the additional loan fee amounts of  each are due within days of the end of the respective period

table of contents part ii item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on our cash on deposit in highly liquid money market accounts  our revolving credit facility and our term note payable 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
the main objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing interest income through low risk investments 
our investment policy focuses on principal preservation and liquidity 
we believe that our interest rate risk related to our portfolio of money market accounts is not material 
additionally  we have immediate access to these funds and could shift these funds to certificates of deposits with guaranteed rates 
the risk related to interest rates for our money market accounts is that these accounts would produce less income than expected if market interest rates fall 
based on current interest rates  we do not believe we are exposed to significant downside risk related to interest on our money market accounts 
the interest rate risk related to borrowings under our line of credit and term debt is a variable rate of libor plus an applicable margin  as defined in the loan agreement at december

one of our supply agreements for caldolor is denominated in australian dollars 
additionally  a portion of our research and development is performed abroad 
as of december   our outstanding payables denominated in a foreign currency totaled approximately million 
currently  we do not utilize financial instruments to hedge exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
we believe our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation is minimal as our purchases in foreign currency have a maximum exposure of days based on invoice terms with a portion of the exposure being limited to days based on the due date of the invoice 
foreign currency exchange losses were immaterial for and neither a increase nor decrease from current exchange rates would have had a material effect on our operating results or financial condition
