critical accounting policies management considers the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our financial statements are affected by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
management believes the company s critical accounting policies are those related to mineral property acquisition costs  exploration and development cost  stock based compensation  derivative accounting and foreign currency translation 
estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements and notes in conformity to us gaap and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates these estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and long lived assets 
management bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
mineral property acquisition costs the company capitalizes the cost of acquiring mineral properties and will amortize these costs over the useful life of a property following the commencement of production or expensed if it is determined that the mineral property has no future economic value or the properties are sold or abandoned 
costs includes cash consideration and the fair market value of shares issued on the acquisition of mineral properties 
properties acquired under option agreements  whereby payments are made at the sole discretion of the company  are recorded in the accounts of the specific mineral property at the time the payments are made 
the amounts recorded as mineral properties reflect actual costs incurred to acquire the properties and do not indicate any present or future value of economically recoverable reserves 

table of contents exploration expenses the company records exploration expenses as incurred 
when it is determined that precious metal resource deposit can be economically and legally extracted or produced based on established proven and probable reserves  further exploration expenses related to such reserves incurred after such a determination will be capitalized 
to date the company has not established any proven or probable reserves and will continue to expense exploration expenses as incurred 
derivatives the company has adopted the amended provisions of asc on determining what types of instruments or embedded features in an instrument held by a reporting entity can be considered indexed to its own stock 
the company has issued stock purchase warrants with exercise prices denominated in a currency other than its functional currency of us dollars 
as a result  these warrants are no longer considered indexed to our stock and must be accounted for as a derivative 
warrants that are issued with exercise prices other than the company s functional currency of the us dollar are accounted for as liabilities 
the fair value of the outstanding warrants liabilities is determined at each reporting date with any change to the liability from a previous period recorded in the statement of operations 
we record changes in fair value of the warrant liabilities as a component of other income and expense as we believe the amounts recorded relate to financing activities and not as a result of our operations 
if a stock purchase warrant is exercised the company is only obligated to issue shares in its common stock 
if the company were to issue stock purchase warrants with exercise prices in its functional currency  the warrants would be considered indexed to our stock and the fair value at date of issue recorded as equity 
there would be no requirement under us gaap to report changes in its fair value from period to period 
foreign currency translation the functional currency of the company is the us dollar 
transactions involving foreign currencies for items included in operations are translated into us dollars using the monthly average exchange rate and monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the consolidated balance sheet date and all other consolidated balance sheet items are translated at historical rates applicable to the transactions that comprise the amounts 
translation gains and losses are included in the determination of other comprehensive loss and gains in the statement of operations

some of our expenses  including labor and operating supplies are denominated in mexican pesos 
as a result  currency exchange fluctuations may impact our operating costs
