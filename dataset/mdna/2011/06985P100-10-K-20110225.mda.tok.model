table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s overview we provide a wide range of well site services to oil and natural gas drilling and producing companies  including completion and remedial services  fluid services  well servicing and contract drilling services 
our results of operations reflect the impact of our acquisition strategy as a leading consolidator in the domestic land based well services industry 
our acquisitions have increased our breadth of service offerings at the well site and expanded our market presence 
in implementing this strategy  we have purchased businesses and assets in separate acquisitions from january  to december  our weighted average number of fluid service trucks increased from in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of we added trucks through the acquisition of azurite services company  inc  azurite leasing company  llc  and freestone disposal  lp collectively azurite in the third quarter of our weighted average number of well servicing rigs increased from in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of our weighted average number of drilling rigs increased from two in the first quarter of to six in the fourth quarter of these acquisitions make changes in revenues  expenses and income not directly comparable between periods 
we revised our business segments beginning in the first quarter of  and in connection therewith  restated the corresponding items of segment information for earlier periods 
our current operating segments are completion and remedial services  fluid services  well servicing and contract drilling 
these segments were selected based on changes in management s resource allocation and performance assessment in making decisions regarding the company 
contract drilling was previously included in our well servicing segment 
well site construction services has been consolidated with our fluid services segment 
our operating revenues from each of our segments  and their relative percentages of our total revenues  consisted of the following dollars in millions year ended december  revenues completion and remedial services fluid services well servicing contract drilling total revenues our core businesses depend on our customers willingness to make expenditures to produce  develop and explore for oil and natural gas in the united states 
industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors  such as the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  domestic and worldwide economic conditions  political instability in oil producing countries and merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers 
the volatility of the oil and natural gas industry  and the consequent impact on exploration and production activity  could adversely impact the level of drilling and workover activity by some of our customers 
this volatility also affects the demand for our services and the price of our services 
in addition  the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves in our market areas also may have an impact on our business  even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices 
for a more comprehensive discussion of our industry trends  see general industry overview included in items and  business and properties  of this annual report on form k 
we derive a majority of our revenues from services supporting production from existing oil and natural gas operations 
demand for these production related services  including well servicing and fluid services  tends to remain relatively stable  even in moderate oil and natural gas price environments  as ongoing maintenance spending is required to sustain production 
as oil and natural gas prices reach higher levels  demand for all of our services generally increases as our customers engage in more well servicing activities relating to existing wells to maintain or increase oil and natural gas production from those wells 
because our services are required to support drilling and 
table of contents workover activities  our revenues will vary based on changes in capital spending by our customers as oil and natural gas prices increase or decrease 
through the middle of  oil and natural gas prices reached historic highs  which increased utilization and pricing for our services 
however  in the latter part of there were significant decreases in oil and natural gas prices  which caused significantly lower utilization of our services in the fourth quarter of in  natural gas prices continued to decline from prices experienced in the fourth quarter of while oil prices increased over the same period 
this decrease in natural gas prices  coupled with adverse changes in the capital markets  resulted in lower demand for our services and increased price competition during  as a number of oil and gas producers reduced their budgets for during  oil prices remained relatively stable following the increase in prices experienced during this trend in oil prices has caused utilization and pricing for our services to increase in our oil based operating areas  while utilization and pricing for our services in our natural gas based operating areas throughout have remained depressed due to low natural gas prices 
we expect oil prices in to remain above levels necessary to support increased capital spending programs for workover and drilling programs as well as routine maintenance 
we believe that the outlook for natural gas prices in will continue to be uncertain  which will cause our customers to remain cautious in their spending until natural gas prices gain strength and stability 
we expect that the supply of available equipment combined with higher demand from our customers will result in utilization levels across all of our business segments showing further improvements throughout as we continue to reactivate and relocate equipment to meet demand  particularly in our established oil oriented market areas 
we will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our business through selective acquisitions and internal growth initiatives 
our capital investment decisions are determined by an analysis of the projected return on capital employed of each of those alternatives  which is substantially driven by the cost to acquire existing assets from a third party  the capital required to build new equipment and the point in the oil and natural gas commodity price cycle 
based on these factors  we make capital investment decisions that we believe will support our long term growth strategy 
while we believe our costs of integration for prior acquisitions have been reflected in our historical results of operations  integration of acquisitions may result in unforeseen operational difficulties or require a disproportionate amount of our management s attention 
we believe that the most important performance measures for our business segments are as follows completion and remedial services segment profits as a percent of revenues  fluid services trucking hours  revenue per truck  segment profits per truck and segment profits as a percent of revenues  well servicing rig hours  rig utilization rate  revenue per rig hour  profits per rig hour and segment profits as a percent of revenues  and contract drilling rig operating days  revenue per drilling day  profits per drilling day and segment profits as a percent of revenues 
segment profits are computed as segment operating revenues less direct operating costs 
these measurements provide important information to us about the activity and profitability of our lines of business 
for a detailed analysis of these indicators for our company  see segment overview below

this acquisition operates in our completion and remedial services and well servicing segments 
segment overview completion and remedial services in  our completion and remedial services segment represented of our revenues 
revenues from our completion and remedial services segment are generally derived from a variety of services designed to stimulate oil and natural gas production or place cement slurry within the wellbores 
our completion and remedial services segment includes pumping services  rental and fishing tool operations  cased hole wireline services  snubbing and underbalanced drilling 
our pumping services concentrate on providing single truck  lower horsepower cementing  acidizing and fracturing services in selected markets 
our total hydraulic horsepower capacity for our pumping services was approximately  horsepower at december  compared to  horsepower at both december  and december  our rental and fishing tool business operates rental and fishing tool stores in selected markets as of december  
table of contents our snubbing services operate units throughout our geographic footprint as of december  we entered the snubbing business in with the acquisition of team snubbing services  which operated in arkansas 
we further expanded our snubbing business in through the acquisition of platinum pressure services  inc  which operated in texas  oklahoma  arkansas  louisiana and pennsylvania 
we have operations in the wireline business and in the underbalanced drilling services business  which we entered into in for a description of our wireline  underbalanced drilling services  and snubbing  please read overview of our segments and services completion and remedial services segment included in items and  business and properties  of this annual report on form k 
in this segment  we generally derive our revenues on a project by project basis in a competitive bidding process 
our bids are generally based on the amount and type of equipment and personnel required  with the materials consumed billed separately 
during periods of decreased spending by oil and gas companies  we may be required to discount our rates to remain competitive  which would cause lower segment profits 
the following is an analysis of our completion and remedial services segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended december   and dollars in thousands segment revenues profits first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year we gauge the performance of our completion and remedial services segment based on the segment s operating revenues and segment profits as a percent of revenues 
fluid services in  our fluid services segment represented of our revenues 
revenues in our fluid services segment are earned from the sale  transportation  storage and disposal of fluids used in the drilling  production and maintenance of oil and natural gas wells 
revenues also include well site construction and maintenance services 
the fluid services segment has a base level of business consisting of transporting and disposing of salt water produced as a by product of the production of oil and natural gas 
these services are necessary for our customers and generally have a stable demand but typically produce lower relative segment profits than other parts of our fluid services segment 
fluid services for completion and workover projects typically require fresh or brine water for making drilling mud  circulating fluids or frac fluids used during a job  and all of these fluids require storage tanks and hauling and disposal 
because we can provide a full complement of fluid sales  trucking  storage and disposal 
table of contents required on most drilling and workover projects  the add on services associated with drilling and workover activity enable us to generate higher segment profits 
the higher segment profits are due to the relatively small incremental labor costs associated with providing these services in addition to our base fluid services operations 
revenues from our well site constructions services are derived primarily from preparing and maintaining access roads and well locations  installing small diameter gathering lines and pipelines  constructing foundations to support drilling rigs and providing maintenance services for oil and natural gas facilities 
we typically price fluid services by the job  by the hour or by the quantities sold  disposed of or hauled

well servicing in  our well servicing segment represented of our revenues 
revenue in our well servicing segment is derived from maintenance  workover  completion and plugging and abandonment services  as well as rig manufacturing operations 
we provide maintenance related services as part of the normal  periodic upkeep of producing oil and natural gas wells 
maintenance related services represent a relatively consistent component of our business 
workover and completion services generate more revenue per hour than maintenance work due to the use of auxiliary equipment  but demand for workover and completion services fluctuates more with the overall activity level in the industry 
we typically charge our well servicing rig customers for services on an hourly basis at rates that are determined by the type of service and equipment required  market conditions in the region in which the rig operates  the ancillary equipment provided on the rig and the necessary personnel 
we measure the activity level of our well servicing rigs on a weekly basis by calculating a rig utilization rate based on a hour work week per rig 

table of contents our well servicing rig fleet increased from a weighted average number of rigs in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of through a combination of newbuild purchases  acquisitions  and other individual equipment purchases 
we manufacture workover rigs for internal purposes as well as to sell to outside companies 
our rig manufacturing operation also performs large scale refurbishments and maintenance services to used workover rigs 
we acquired our rig manufacturing business in may the following is an analysis of our well servicing segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended december   and the revenues do not include revenues associated with rig manufacturing operations weighted average rig profits number of rig utilization revenue per per rig segment rigs hours rate rig hour hour profits first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year we gauge activity levels in our well servicing rig operations based on rig hours  rig utilization rate  revenue per rig hour  profits per rig hour and segment profits as a percent of revenues 
contract drilling in  our contract drilling segment represented of our revenues 
revenues from our contract drilling segment are derived primarily from the drilling of new wells 
within this segment  we typically charge our drilling rig customers at a daywork daily rate  or footage at an established rate per number of feet drilled 
depending on the type of job  we may also charge by the project 
we measure the activity level of our drilling rigs on a weekly basis by calculating a rig utilization rate based on a seven day work week per rig 
in the fourth quarter of  we converted three of our drilling rigs to well service rigs

operating cost overview our operating costs are comprised primarily of labor costs  including workers compensation and health insurance  repair and maintenance  fuel and insurance 
a majority of our employees are paid on an hourly basis 
we also incur costs to employ personnel to sell and supervise our services and perform maintenance on our fleet 
these costs are not directly tied to our level of business activity 
compensation for our administrative personnel in local operating yards and in our corporate office is accounted for as general and administrative expenses 
repair and maintenance is performed by our crews  company maintenance personnel and outside service providers 
insurance is generally a fixed cost regardless of utilization and relates to the number of rigs  trucks and other equipment in our fleet  employee payroll and our safety record 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
a complete summary of these policies is included in note of the notes to our historical consolidated financial statements 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 
critical accounting policies we have identified below accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position  results of operations and cash flows and which require the application of significant judgment by management 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are stated at cost  or at estimated fair value at acquisition date if acquired in a business combination 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as 
table of contents incurred 
we also review the capitalization of refurbishment of workover rigs as described in note of the notes to our historical consolidated financial statements 
impairments 
we review our assets for impairment at a minimum annually  or whenever  in management s judgment  events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recovered over its remaining service life 
provisions for asset impairment are charged to income when the sum of the estimated future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  is less than the asset s carrying amount 
when impairment is indicated  an impairment charge is recorded based on an estimate of future cash flows on a discounted basis 
self insured risk accruals 
we are self insured up to retention limits with regard to workers compensation and medical and dental coverage of our employees 
we generally maintain no physical property damage coverage on our workover rig fleet  with the exception of certain of our hour workover rigs and newly manufactured rigs 
we have deductibles per occurrence for workers compensation and general liability and medical and dental coverage of   and  respectively 
we have lower deductibles per occurrence for automobile liability 
we maintain accruals in our consolidated balance sheets related to self insurance retentions by using third party actuarial data and historical claims history 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues when the services are performed  collection of the relevant receivables is probable  persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists and the price is fixed and determinable 
rig manufacturing revenue is recognized by individual rig based on the completed contract method 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in the period that includes the statutory enactment date 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recognized when it is more likely than not that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
we analyze our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
depreciation and amortization 
in order to depreciate and amortize our property and equipment and our intangible assets with finite lives  we estimate the useful lives and salvage values of these items 
our estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
impairment of property and equipment 
our analysis for potential impairment of property and equipment requires us to estimate undiscounted future cash flows 
actual impairment charges are recorded using an estimate of discounted future cash flows 
the determination of future cash flows requires us to estimate rates and utilization in future periods and such estimates can change based on market conditions  technological advances in industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
we analyze the potential impairment of property and equipment annually as of december or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the assets have decreased below the carrying value 
impairment of goodwill 
our goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized 
we assess impairment of goodwill annually as of december or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value 
a two step process is required for testing impairment 
first  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an indication of impairment exists 
if impairment is indicated  then the fair value of the reporting 
table of contents unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the unit s fair value to its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the amount of impairment for goodwill is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its fair value 
we performed an assessment of goodwill as of march  a triggering event requiring this assessment was deemed to have occurred because the oil and natural gas services industry continued to decline in the first quarter of and our common stock price declined by from december  to march  for step one of the impairment testing  we tested three reporting units for goodwill impairment well servicing  fluid services  and completion and remedial services 
our contract drilling reporting unit does not carry any goodwill and was not subject to the test 
to estimate the fair value of the reporting units  we used a weighting of the discounted cash flow method and the public company guideline method of determining fair value of a business unit 
we weighted the discounted cash flow method and public company guideline method  due to differences between our reporting units and the peer companies size  profitability and diversity of operations 
in order to validate the reasonableness of the estimated fair values obtained for the reporting units  a reconciliation of fair value to market capitalization was performed for each unit on a stand alone basis 
a control premium  derived from market transaction data  was used in this reconciliation to ensure that fair values were reasonably stated in conjunction with our capitalization 
the measurement date for our common stock price and market capitalization was the closing price on march  based on the results of step one of the impairment test  impairment was indicated in all three of the assessed reporting units 
as such  we were required to perform step two assessment on all three of the reporting units 
step two requires the allocation of the estimated fair value to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the respective unit 
this assessment indicated that million was considered impaired as of march  this non cash charge eliminated all of our existing goodwill as of march  allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on an analysis of historical collection activity and specific identification of overdue accounts 
factors that may affect this estimate include changes in the financial positions of significant customers and a decline in commodity prices that could affect the entire customer base 
litigation and self insured risk reserves 
we estimate our reserves related to litigation and self insured risk based on the facts and circumstances specific to the litigation and self insured risk claims and our past experience with similar claims 
the actual outcome of litigation and insured claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts 
as discussed in self insured risk accruals above with respect to our critical accounting policies  we maintain accruals on our balance sheet to cover self insured retentions 
these accruals are based on certain assumptions developed using third party data and historical data to project future losses 
loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals are adjusted based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations  which involves the use of various assumptions 
these estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
the most significant assumptions  and the ones requiring the most judgment  involve the estimated fair value of property and equipment  intangible assets and the resulting amount of goodwill  if any 
we test annually for impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives recorded in business combinations 
this requires us to estimate the fair values of our own assets and liabilities at the reporting unit level 
therefore  considerable judgment  similar to that described above in connection with our estimation of the fair value of an acquired company  is required to assess goodwill and certain intangible assets for impairment 
cash flow estimates 
our estimates of future cash flows are based on the most recent available market and operating data for the applicable asset or reporting unit at the time the estimate is made 
our cash flow estimates are used for asset impairment analyses 
stock based compensation 
we have historically compensated our directors  executives and employees through the awarding of stock options and restricted stock 
we accounted for stock option and restricted stock awards in  and using a grant date fair value based method  resulting in compensation expense for stock based awards being recorded in our consolidated statements of income 
stock options issued are valued on the 
table of contents grant date using black scholes merton option pricing model and restricted stock issued is valued based on the fair value of our common stock at the grant date 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
because the determination of these various assumptions is subject to significant management judgment and different assumptions could result in material differences in amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements  management believes that accounting estimates related to the valuation of stock options are critical 
income taxes 
the amount and availability of our loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes are subject to a variety of interpretations and restrictive tests 
the utilization of such carryforwards could be limited or lost upon certain changes in ownership and the passage of time 
accordingly  although we believe substantial loss carryforwards are available to us  no assurance can be given concerning the realization of such loss carryforwards  or whether or not such loss carryforwards will be available in the future 
asset retirement obligations 
we record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and capitalize an equal amount as a cost of the asset  depreciating it over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation is adjusted at the end of each quarter to reflect the passage of time  changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation  acquisition or construction of assets  and settlement of obligations 
results of operations the results of operations between periods will not be comparable  primarily due to the significant decline in the oil and natural gas industry throughout and recovery throughout year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased by to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to increased expenditures by our customers for our services  especially in oil producing areas that had significant increases in exploration  completion of new wells and workovers performed on existing wells 
completion and remedial services revenues increased by to million in as compared to million in the increase in revenue between these periods was due to increased utilization of our pressure pumping equipment  resulting from higher drilling and completion activity as well as improved pricing for our services

general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million in from million in  which included million and million of stock based compensation expense in and  respectively 
the increase from primarily reflects higher salary expenses related to the increase in the number of employees along with the reversal of pay reductions enacted at the end of the first quarter of and higher incentive compensation 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million in  as compared to million in  reflecting the increase in the size of and investment in our asset base

interest expense increased by to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the effect in of the issuance of million of senior secured notes in july  the proceeds of which were used to retire our previous million revolving credit facility 
income tax expense 
income tax benefit was million in  as compared to an expense of million in our effective benefit rate was approximately in and our effective benefit rate was approximately in the lower effective benefit rate in relates to the goodwill write down in the first quarter of and is due to differences in the taxable nature of the impaired goodwill 
a portion of the goodwill came from stock acquisitions  which have zero tax bases 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues decreased by to million in from billion in this decrease was primarily due to lower expenditures by our customers for our services and increased price competition from our competitors due to the decline in oil and natural gas prices 
completion and remedial services revenues decreased by to million in as compared to million in the decrease in revenue between these periods was due to decreased utilization of equipment due to the decline in oil and natural gas prices 
increased market competition also caused significant rate declines 
total hydraulic horsepower was  at both december  and december  fluid services revenues decreased by to million in compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to decreased rates that we charged to our customers for our services caused by increased 
table of contents price competition from our competitors 
these decreases were partially offset by the azurite acquisition in september which added fluid service trucks and frac tanks 
our weighted average number of fluid service trucks increased to in from in  although our revenue per fluid service truck decreased to  in compared to  in well servicing revenues decreased by to million in compared to million in this decrease was due to the decrease in rig utilization to during from during  along with a decrease in revenue per rig hour to during from during these declines were due to decreased expenditures by our customers for our services along with decreased pricing for our services as a result of price competition with our competitors 
our average number of well servicing rigs increased to during compared to in  due to internal expansion from our newbuild rig program and the lackey construction  llc and the triple n services  inc acquisitions 
contract drilling revenues decreased by to million in compared to million in the number of rig operating days decreased to  in compared to  in this decrease was due to fewer new well starts in the geographic market in which we operate 
direct operating expenses 
direct operating expenses  which primarily consist of labor  including workers compensation and health insurance  and maintenance and repair costs  decreased by to million in from million in this decrease was due to the lower activity levels in all of our segments and cost cutting measures implemented as a result of the decline in revenues 
direct operating expenses for the completion and remedial services segment decreased by to million in as compared to million in due primarily to decreased activity levels
