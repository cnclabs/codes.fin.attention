item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview business we provide technologically advanced  innovative products  services  and integrated solutions in aerospace  electronics  information and services and shipbuilding to our global customers 
we participate in many high priority defense and commercial technology programs in the united states us and abroad as a prime contractor  principal subcontractor  partner  or preferred supplier 
we conduct most of our business with the us government  principally the department of defense dod 
we also conduct business with local  state  and foreign governments and domestic and international commercial customers 
notable events certain notable events or activities affecting our consolidated financial results included the following significant financial events for the year ended december  n recorded million pre tax charge related to the winding down of our shipbuilding operations at the avondale  louisiana facility

n authorized new share repurchases of up to billion 
outlook beginning with the credit crisis of through the present  the united states and global economies have experienced a period of substantial economic uncertainty and turmoil  and the related financial markets have been characterized by significant volatility 
while the financial markets have begun to stabilize and improve in and  the us and global economies continue to struggle as a result of high levels of national debt and historic levels of borrowing to support stimulus and financial support spending 
current levels of deficit spending are at high levels and likely are unsustainable for the us and several of its allies  and we expect that us and allied government defense spending may come under increasing pressure as governments search for ways to reduce deficits and national debts 
defense secretary gates recently proposed a baseline fiscal defense budget of billion  which is billion higher than the fiscal budget request  but billion less than previously planned 
under this budget proposal  the overall defense budget will decline by billion over a five year period beginning in fiscal from the previous plan  and will include program cancellations and restructurings  including reducing the number of f joint strike fighters from to jets 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation over that period 
northrop grumman is one of the largest subcontractors on the f program  and if approved by congress  the reduction would impact our revenues 
secretary gates also outlined future opportunities for which we could compete  including a next generation nuclear capable long range bomber  additional f a e f aircraft to offset the reduction in the f aircraft  as well as numerous opportunities to apply our unmanned airborne technologies and capabilities and our broad sensor technologies to new products and to upgrade several existing platforms 
while the real rate of growth in the top line defense budget may be slowing for the first time since  the us government s budgetary process continues to give us good visibility regarding future spending and the threat areas that it is addressing 
we believe that our current contracts  and our strong backlog of previously awarded contracts align well with our customer s future needs  and this provides us with good insight regarding future cash flows from our businesses 
nonetheless  we recognize that no business is immune to the current economic situation and new policy initiatives could adversely affect future defense spending levels  which could lower our expected future revenues 
certain programs in which we participate may be subject to potential reductions due to this slower rate of growth in the us defense budget and the utilization of funds to support the ongoing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan 
liquidity trends in light of the ongoing economic situation  we have evaluated our future liquidity needs  both from a short term and long term perspective 
we expect that cash on hand at the beginning of the year plus cash generated from operations and cash available under credit lines will be sufficient in to service debt  finance capital expansion projects  pay federal  foreign  and state income taxes  fund pension and other post retirement benefit plans  and continue paying dividends to shareholders 
we have a committed billion revolving credit facility  with a maturity date of august   that can be accessed on a same day basis 
we believe we can obtain additional capital to provide for long term liquidity  if necessary  from such sources as the public or private capital markets  the sale of assets  sale and leaseback of operating assets  and leasing rather than purchasing new assets 
we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec 
see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussions about our financing activities 
industry factors we are subject to the unique characteristics of the us defense industry as a monopsony  whereby demand for our products and services comes primarily from one customer  and by certain elements peculiar to our own business mix 
recent developments in us cost accounting standards cas pension recovery rules on may   the cas board published a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm that if adopted would provide a framework to partially harmonize the cas rules with the pension protection act of ppa funding requirements 
the nprm would harmonize by mitigating the mismatch between cas costs and ppa amended employee retirement income security act erisa minimum funding requirements 
until the final rule is published  and to the extent that the final rule does not completely eliminate mismatches between erisa funding requirements and cas pension costs  government contractors maintaining defined benefit pension plans will continue to experience a timing mismatch between required contributions and pension expenses recoverable under cas 
the final rule is expected to be issued in and to apply to contracts starting the year following the award of the first cas covered contract after the effective date of the new rule 
this would mean the rule would apply to our contracts in we anticipate that contractors will be entitled to an equitable adjustment for any additional cas contract costs resulting from the final rule 
economic opportunities  challenges  and risks the united states continues to face a complex and rapidly changing national security environment  while simultaneously addressing domestic economic challenges such as unemployment  federal budget deficits and the growing national debt 
the us government s investment in capabilities that respond to constantly evolving threats is increasingly being balanced against the need to address domestic economic challenges 
we believe that 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation the us government will continue to place a high priority on defense spending and national security  as well as economic challenges  and will continue to invest in sophisticated systems providing long range surveillance and intelligence  battle management  precision strike  and strategic agility 
the us government faces the additional challenge of recapitalizing equipment and rebuilding readiness while also pursuing modernization and reducing overhead and inefficiency 
the dod has announced several initiatives to improve efficiency  refocus priorities and enhance dod business practices including those used to procure goods and services from defense contractors 
the dod initiatives are organized into five major areas affordability and cost growth  productivity and innovation  competition  services acquisition  and processes and bureaucracy 
initial plans resulting from these initiatives were announced in early and the defense department expects that these initiatives will generate billion in savings 
on january   secretary gates provided initial details on fiscal year defense budget and programmatic plans and elaborated on the allocation of the billion in expected savings from efficiency initiatives 
the secretary described plans to allocate billion for increased operating costs and billion for investment in high priority capabilities 
in addition to the efficiency savings  the dod plans to reduce defense spending from its prior plans by billion over the next five fiscal years 
at the date of this report  the fiscal year defense budget has not been submitted by the president and congress had not yet passed a baseline fiscal year defense budget or any of the appropriations funding bills relating to our customer base 
as a result  the us government is currently operating under a continuing resolution cr that funds programs and services at fiscal year levels 
the cr is set to expire on march   after which congress will either pass a new appropriations bill or extend a cr 
the latter case would likely fund programs at fiscal year levels and would affect the profitability of some of our programs and potentially delay new awards 
we anticipate continued spirited debate over defense spending in as part of a larger dialog around the federal deficit and potential cuts in government spending 
budget decisions made in this environment could have long term consequences for our company and the entire defense industry 
although reductions to certain programs in which we participate or for which we expect to compete are always possible  we believe that spending on recapitalization  modernization and maintenance of defense and homeland security assets will continue to be a national priority 
future defense spending is expected to include the development and procurement of new manned and unmanned military platforms and systems along with advanced electronics and software to enhance the capabilities of individual systems and provide for the real time integration of individual surveillance  information management  strike  and battle management platforms 
given the current era of irregular warfare  we expect an increase in investment in persistent awareness with intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance isr systems  cyber warfare  and expansion of information available for the warfighter to make timely decisions 
other significant new competitive opportunities include long range strike  directed energy applications  missile defense  satellite communications systems  restricted programs  cybersecurity  technical services and information technology contracts  and numerous international and homeland security programs 
prime contracts with various agencies of the us government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement and other regulations  including the false claims act and the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act 
noncompliance found by any one agency could result in fines  penalties  debarment  or suspension from receiving contracts with all us government agencies 
we could experience material adverse effects on our business operations if we or a portion of our business were suspended or debarred 
we could be affected by future laws or regulations  including those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as green initiatives 
we recently established a goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions over a five year period through december  to comply with existing green initiatives and our greenhouse gas emissions goal  we expect to incur capital and operating costs  but at this time 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation we do not expect that such costs will have a material adverse effect upon our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

government contracts typically include the following cost elements direct material  labor 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation and subcontracting costs  and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative costs 
unless otherwise specified in a contract  costs billed to contracts with the us government are determined under the requirements of the federal acquisition regulation far and cas regulations as allowable and allocable costs 
examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the us government in accordance with the requirements of the far and cas regulations include  but are not limited to  certain legal costs  lobbying costs  charitable donations  interest expense and advertising costs 
our long term contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories flexibly priced contracts includes both cost type and fixed price incentive contracts 
cost type contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor s allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit 
cost type contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation 
fixed price incentive contracts also provide for reimbursement of the contractor s allowable costs  but are subject to a cost share limit which affects profitability 
fixed price incentive contracts effectively become firm fixed price contracts once the cost share limit is reached 
firm fixed price contracts a firm fixed price contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a pre determined  negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor 
time and materials contracts are considered firm fixed price contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged 
the following table summarizes revenue recognized by contract type and customer us other percent in millions government customers total of total flexibly priced firm fixed price total contract fees negotiated contract fee structures  for both flexibly priced and fixed price contracts include  but are not limited to fixed fee amounts  cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost target performance  positive award fees  and negative penalty arrangements 
profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements  percentage of completion of the contract  the achievement of performance objectives  and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees  particularly under incentive and award fee contracts  is finally determined 
award fees certain contracts contain provisions consisting of award fees based on performance criteria such as cost  schedule  quality  and technical performance 
award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of the company s performance against such negotiated criteria 
fees that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 
award fee contracts are used in certain of our operating segments 
examples of significant long term contracts with substantial negotiated award fee amounts are the broad area maritime surveillance bams unmanned aircraft system and the majority of satellite contracts 
compliance and monitoring we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations 
in addition  costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency 
critical accounting policies  estimates  and judgments revenue recognition overview we derive the majority of our business from long term contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the federal government  which are accounted for in conformity with accounting principles 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation generally accepted in the united states of america gaap for construction type and production type contracts and federal government contractors 
we classify contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contract 
we also enter into contracts that are not associated with the federal government  such as contracts to provide certain services to non federal government customers 
we account for those contracts in accordance with the relevant gaap revenue recognition principles 
we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting method for a particular contract 
percentage of completion accounting we generally recognize revenues from our long term contracts under the cost to cost or the units of delivery measures of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses 
for most contracts  sales are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract 
for certain contracts with large up front purchases of material  primarily in the shipbuilding segment  sales are generally calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs 
the units of delivery measure is a modification of the percentage of completion method  which recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales values in accordance with the contract terms 
we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on deliveries 
the use of the percentage of completion method depends on our ability to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design  manufacture  and delivery of our products and services 
such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years  and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment 
we record sales under cost type contracts as costs are incurred 
many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product 
these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred 
incentives and award fees that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 
incentives and award fees that are not reasonably assured or cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made 
other changes in estimates of contract sales  costs  and profits are recognized using the cumulative catch up method of accounting 
this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods 
hence  the effect of the changes on future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate had been the original estimate 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
certain service contracts we generally recognize revenue under contracts to provide services to non federal government customers when services are performed 
service contracts include operations and maintenance contracts  and outsourcing type arrangements  primarily in technical services and information systems 
we generally recognize revenue under such contracts on a straight line basis over the period of contract performance  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs incurred under these service contracts are expensed as incurred  except that direct and incremental set up costs are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement 
operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate from period to period  particularly in the earlier phases of the contract 
contracts that include more than one type of product or service are accounted for under the relevant gaap guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple elements 
accordingly  for applicable arrangements  revenue recognition includes the proper identification of separate units of accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair values 
cost estimation the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers  program managers  and financial professionals 
factors that are 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability  productivity and cost of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance  the availability and timing of funding from the customer  and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we update our contract cost estimates at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances 
we generally review and reassess our cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract on a quarterly basis 
we record a provision for the entire loss on the contract in the period the loss is determined when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned 
we offset loss provisions first against costs that are included in unbilled accounts receivable or inventoried assets  with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities 
purchase accounting and goodwill overview we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values  with the excess recorded as goodwill 
such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time  which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates 
adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the measurement period are recognized in net earnings 
acquisition accruals we establish certain accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies from our acquisitions and divestitures 
we have recorded these accruals and subsequent adjustments during the purchase price allocation period for acquisitions and as events occur for divestitures 
the accruals were determined based upon the terms of the purchase or sales agreements and  in most cases  involve a significant degree of judgment 
we recorded these accruals in accordance with our interpretation of the terms of the purchase or sale agreements  known facts  and an estimation of probable future events based on our experience 
tests for impairment we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november th of each year  or when evidence of potential impairment exists 
we record a charge to operations when we determine that an impairment has occurred 
in order to test for potential impairment  we use a discounted cash flow analysis  corroborated by comparative market multiples where appropriate 
the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected results of operations  weighted average cost of capital wacc  and terminal value assumptions 
the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to market entry 
the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model 
as a result of our announcement to wind down operations at shipbuilding s avondale  louisiana facility see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item  we performed an interim impairment test on shipbuilding s goodwill as of june   and concluded that the estimated fair value of the shipbuilding reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value 
the results of our annual goodwill impairment test as of november   indicated that the estimated fair value of all reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values 
due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill  differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation litigation  commitments  and contingencies overview we are subject to a range of claims  lawsuits  environmental and income tax matters  and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and our internal and external legal counsel 
in accordance with our practices relating to accounting for contingencies  we record amounts as charges to earnings after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter known to us  including any settlement offers  and determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 
when a range of costs is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate than another  we record the minimum amount of the range 
us government claims from time to time  our customers advise us of ordinary course claims and penalties concerning certain potential disallowed costs 
when such findings are presented  we engage us government representatives in discussions to enable us to evaluate the merits of these claims as well as to assess the amounts being claimed 
where appropriate  provisions are made to reflect our expected exposure to the matters raised by the us government representatives and such provisions are reviewed on a quarterly basis for sufficiency based on the most recent information available 
environmental accruals we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations 
we record a liability for the costs of expected environmental remediation obligations when we determine that it is probable we will incur such costs  and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
when a range of costs is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate than another  we record the minimum amount of the range 
factors which could result in changes to the assessment of probability  range of estimated costs  and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions  increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate  discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated  results of efforts to involve other legally responsible parties  financial insolvency of other responsible parties  changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements  and improvements in remediation technology 
litigation accruals litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management  after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter  including any settlement offers  has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the ultimate resolution of any exposure to us may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known to us 
uncertain tax positions tax positions meeting the more likely than not recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized in the financial statements 
the timing and amount of accrued interest is determined by the applicable tax law associated with an underpayment of income taxes 
if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties  we recognize an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed in our tax return 
we recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
penalties  if probable and reasonably estimable  are recognized as a component of income tax expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item under existing gaap  prior to january   changes in accruals associated with uncertainties arising from the resolution of pre acquisition contingencies of acquired businesses were charged or credited to goodwill  effective january   such changes will be recorded to income tax expense 
adjustments to other tax accruals are generally recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 
retirement benefits overview we annually evaluate assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for our pension plans and other post retirement benefits plans in consultation with our outside 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation actuaries 
in the event that we determine that plan amendments or changes in the assumptions are warranted  future pension and post retirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease 
assumptions the principal assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the health care cost trend rate and the estimated fair market value of plan assets 
for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable  such as real estate  private equity  and hedge funds  estimates of fair value are determined using the best information available 
discount rate the discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and post retirement benefit obligations 
the discount rate is generally based on the yield of high quality corporate fixed income investments 
at the end of each year  the discount rate is primarily determined using the results of bond yield curve models based on a portfolio of high quality bonds matching the notional cash inflows with the expected benefit payments for each significant benefit plan 
taking into consideration the factors noted above  our weighted average pension composite discount rate was percent at december   and percent at december  holding all other assumptions constant  and since net actuarial gains and losses were in excess of the percent accounting corridor in  an increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate assumption for would have decreased or increased pension and post retirement benefit expense for by approximately million  of which million relates to post retirement benefits  and decreased or increased the amount of the benefit obligation recorded at december   by approximately million  of which million relates to post retirement benefits 
the effects of hypothetical changes in the discount rate for a single year may not be representative and may be asymmetrical or nonlinear for future years because of the application of the accounting corridor 
the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required 
due to adverse capital market conditions in our pension plan assets experienced a negative return of approximately percent in as a result  substantially all of our plans experienced net actuarial losses outside the percent accounting corridor at the end of  thus requiring accumulated gains and losses to be amortized to expense 
as a result of this condition  sensitivity of net periodic pension costs to changes in the discount rate were much higher in and than was the case in and prior 
this condition is expected to continue into the near future 
expected long term rate of return the expected long term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested in a specified target asset allocation to provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations 
for and  we assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent 
an increase or decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return assumption for  holding all other assumptions constant  would increase or decrease our pension and post retirement benefit expense for by approximately million  of which million relates to post retirement benefits 
health care cost trend rates the health care cost trend rates represent the annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits based on external estimates of health care inflation  changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns  technological advances  and changes in the health status of the plan participants 
using a combination of market expectations and economic projections including the effect of health care reform  we selected an expected initial health care cost trend rate of percent for and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of percent reached in in  we assumed an expected initial health care cost trend rate of percent for and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of percent reached in although our actual cost experience is much lower at this time  market conditions and the potential effects of health care reform are expected to increase medical cost trends in the next one to three years thus our past experience may not reflect future conditions 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation differences in the initial through the ultimate health care cost trend rates within the range indicated below would have had the following impact on post retirement benefit results percentage percentage in millions point increase point decrease increase decrease from change in health care cost trend rates to post retirement benefit expense post retirement benefit liability

see the segment operating results section below for further information 
general and administrative expenses in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts  most general corporate expenses incurred at both the segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts 
for most components of the company  these costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost 
general and administrative expenses primarily relate to segment operations 
general and administrative expenses for decreased million from the prior year primarily due to the disposition of asd at our information systems segment 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales and service revenues decreased from percent in to percent in  primarily due to cost reductions realized from the streamlining of our organizational structure from seven to five operating segments 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales and service revenues decreased from percent in to percent in  primarily due to lower corporate overhead costs and a million gain from a legal settlement in  net of legal provisions and related expenses 
goodwill impairment in  we recorded a non cash charge totaling billion at aerospace systems and shipbuilding as a result of adverse equity market conditions that caused a decrease in market multiples and our stock price 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation operating income loss we consider operating income to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and  as is typical in the industry  we define operating income as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses 
we also further evaluate operating income for each of the business segments in which we operate 
we internally manage our operations by reference to segment operating income 
segment operating income is defined as operating income before unallocated expenses and net pension adjustment  neither of which affect the operating results of segments  and the reversal of royalty income  which is classified as other  net for financial reporting purposes 
segment operating income is one of the key metrics we use to evaluate operating performance 
segment operating income is not  however  a measure of financial performance under gaap  and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner 
the table below reconciles segment operating income to total operating income year ended december in millions segment operating income loss unallocated corporate expenses net pension adjustment royalty income adjustment total operating income loss segment operating income loss segment operating income in increased million  or percent  as compared with total segment operating income was percent and percent of total sales and service revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in segment operating income is primarily due to the percent increase in sales volume and performance improvements across all operating segments 
segment operating income in was billion as compared with segment operating loss of million in the loss in was primarily due to goodwill impairment charges totaling billion at aerospace systems and shipbuilding 
see discussion of segment operating results below for further information 
unallocated corporate expenses unallocated corporate expenses generally include the portion of corporate expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas and far rules  and therefore not allocated to the segments  such as management and administration  legal  environmental  certain compensation and retiree benefits  and other expenses 
unallocated corporate expenses for increased million  or percent  as compared with  primarily due to inclusion of a million net gain from a legal settlement in  as well as an increase in environmental  health and welfare  and stock compensation expenses in unallocated corporate expenses for decreased million  or percent  as compared with  primarily due to a million gain from a legal settlement in  net of legal provisions and related expenses  partially offset by higher costs related to environmental remediation and post retirement employee benefits

segment operating results basis of presentation we are aligned into five reportable segments aerospace systems  electronic systems  information systems  shipbuilding and technical services 
see note in part ii  item for more information about our segments 
in january  we transferred our internal information technology services unit from the information systems segment to our corporate shared services group 
the intersegment sales and operating income for this unit that were previously recognized in the information systems segment are immaterial and have been eliminated for the years presented 
year ended december in millions sales and service revenues aerospace systems electronic systems information systems shipbuilding technical services intersegment eliminations total sales and service revenues

key segment financial measures operating performance assessment and reporting we manage and assess the performance of our businesses based on our performance on individual contracts and programs obtained generally from government organizations using the financial measures referred to below  with consideration given to the critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments described on page as indicated in our discussion on contracts on page  our portfolio of long term contracts is largely flexibly priced  which means that sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of active contracts  with operating income being a critical measure of operational performance 
due to far rules that govern our business  most types of costs are allowable  and we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as cost of sales or general and administrative costs as much as we do on total contract costs  which are a key factor in determining contract operating income 
as a result  in evaluating our operating performance  we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues  and operating income  including the effects of significant changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates and the use of the cumulative catch up method of accounting in accordance with gaap 
unusual fluctuations in operating performance attributable to changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts  however  are described in our analysis 
based on this approach and the nature of our operations  the discussion of results of operations generally focuses around our five segments versus distinguishing between products and services 
our aerospace systems  electronic systems and shipbuilding segments generate predominantly product sales  while the information systems and technical services segments generate predominantly service revenues 
sales and service revenues period to period sales reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts 
changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume 
unless otherwise described  volume generally refers to increases or decreases in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels  delivery rates  or service levels on individual contracts 
volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the margin rate for a particular contract 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation segment operating income segment operating income reflects the aggregate performance results of contracts within a business area or segment 
excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance  including the portion of corporate expenses such as management and administration  legal  environmental  certain compensation and other retiree benefits  and other expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas regulations and the far  and therefore not allocated to the segments 
changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume  as discussed above  or performance 
performance refers to changes in contract margin rates 
these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion of the contract eac that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on a particular contract 
operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an eac change is recorded 
operating income may also be affected by  among other things  the effects of workforce stoppages  natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes  resolution of disputed items with the customer  recovery of insurance proceeds  and other discrete events 
at the completion of a long term contract  any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized such as warranty reserves could also impact contract earnings 
where such items have occurred  and the effects are material  a separate description is provided

liquidity and capital resources we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating results into cash for deployment in growing our businesses and maximizing shareholder value 
we actively manage our capital resources through working capital improvements  capital expenditures  strategic business acquisitions and divestitures  debt issuance and repayment  required and voluntary pension contributions  and returning cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and repurchases of common stock 
we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision making  including net cash provided by operations  free cash flow  net debt to equity  and net debt to capital 
we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance 
the table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities 
year ended december in millions net earnings loss earnings from discontinued operations gain on sale of businesses charge on debt redemption impairment of goodwill other non cash items retiree benefit funding in excess of expense trade working capital increase decrease cash provided by discontinued operations net cash provided by operating activities includes depreciation amortization  stock based compensation expense and deferred taxes 
free cash flow free cash flow represents cash from operating activities less capital expenditures and outsourcing contract and related software costs 
outsourcing contract and related software costs are similar to capital expenditures in that the contract costs represent incremental external costs or certain specific internal costs that are directly related to the contract acquisition and transition set up 
these outsourcing contract and related software costs are deferred and expensed over the contract life 
we believe free cash flow is a useful measure for investors to consider 
this measure is a key factor used by management in our planning for and consideration of strategic acquisitions  stock repurchases and the payment of dividends 
free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap  and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner 
this measure should not be considered in isolation  as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes  or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap as indicators of performance
