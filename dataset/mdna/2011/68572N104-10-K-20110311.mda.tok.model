you should specifically consider the various risk factors identified in this filing that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 

table of contents executive overview what were our key financial results our net sales in decreased to million compared to million in  including a decrease in net sales of converted product and a increase in parent roll sales 
our operating income in decreased to million compared to million in our earnings per diluted common share in decreased to per diluted common share compared with per diluted common share in our ebitda in decreased to million compared to million in we continued our trend of positive operating cash flow in of million 
we have generated positive operating cash flow each of the last ten years 
what did we focus on in in  we focused on completion of our converting expansion project which consisted of a new converting line and a new warehouse 
this million project was completed on time and within budget 
the new converting line was installed and put into production at the end of the second quarter of this new converting line increases our converting capacity by approximately million cases 
the warehouse was completed at the end of the second quarter of and allowed us to discontinue use of a third party warehouse during the third quarter  thereby eliminating the storage and product transfer costs associated with that facility 
we focused considerable efforts in the paper making operations to improve product quality attributes  such as bathroom tissue softness  to supplement the higher product quality production capabilities of the new converting line 
these efforts will continue in as we expand into the mid tier market segment 
what challenges and opportunities did our business face in the price of waste paper  our primary cost component in the production of parent rolls  presented a challenge during following a sharp decrease from the end of through the first half  waste paper prices rose each month from the beginning of the third quarter of through the end of the second quarter prices have been relatively flat during the last half of on a year over year basis  waste paper prices increased in compared to due to a very competitive environment  we were unable to increase selling prices during to compensate for the increased waste paper costs and as a result  our operating margins were reduced 
in addition  primarily due to the competitive environment  our converted product shipments were lower in by approximately compared to  which resulted in lower production in the converting operations and higher per unit operating costs 
what will we focus on in in  we will continue to focus our sales efforts on obtaining new business to fill out our converting capacity 
we shipped approximately million cases of converted product in which is approximately of our converting capacity following the start up of our new eleventh line 
we intend to focus the capacity from our eleventh converting line on strategic growth opportunities with existing customers and opportunities with new customers 
the enhanced product quality and product configurations that are available on the eleventh converting line provide the opportunity to position these products into higher tier product offerings  which should carry higher operating margins 
these higher tier products open up new markets to us that we have previously been unable to serve 

table of contents our paper making operation will continue to work on quality improvement to provide higher product quality attributes for our converting operation  which will aid in our sales efforts to penetrate the higher quality mid tier market segment 
we will continue to focus on optimizing our existing operating assets in both converting and paper mill operations 
specific emphasis will be placed on maximizing the efficiency of our new converting line 
emphasis will continue to be placed on identifying root causes of issues that impede productivity and to identify ways to improve our overall production costs 
business overview we are an integrated manufacturer of bulk tissue paper  also known as parent rolls which we convert into a broad line of private label tissue products  including paper towels  bathroom tissue and paper napkins  for the consumer  or at home  market 
we have tailored our operations to serve our core customer base of dollar stores or value retailers and other discount retailers 
we focus on the dollar stores and discount retail market because of their consistent order patterns and low number of stock keeping units or skus in this market 
all of our converted product revenue is derived pursuant to truck load purchase orders from our customers 
parent roll revenue is derived from purchase orders that generally cover a one month time period 
we do not have supply contracts with any of our customers 
revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer 
because our product is a daily consumable item  the order stream from our customer base is fairly consistent with no significant seasonal fluctuations 
changes in the national economy  in general  do not materially affect the market for our converted products 
our profitability depends on several key factors  including the market price of our product  the cost of recycled waste paper used in producing paper  the efficiency of operations in both our paper mill and converting plant  and the cost of energy 
the private label segment of the tissue industry is highly competitive  and discount retail customers are extremely price sensitive 
as a result  it is difficult to effect price increases 
we expect these competitive conditions to continue 
our strategy is to sell all of the parent rolls we manufacture as converted products which generally carry higher margins than parent rolls 
our converting expansion project  which was completed at the end of the second quarter of  added an eleventh converting line to our converting capacity and a  square foot warehouse 
the new line has a rated capacity of approximately four million cases of either kitchen towel or bathroom tissue products  bringing our total annual converting capacity to approximately twelve million cases 
the new line provides higher quality products and broadens our product offerings to supply the higher quality  mid tier market segment through increased packaging configurations  enhanced graphics and improved embossing 
we expect to sell the majority of the output from this new line to new customers  particularly in the grocery segment 
the completion of the new warehouse has allowed us to consolidate all warehousing and shipping in our pryor location  thereby eliminating third party warehouse charges and product transfer costs 
although we have an annual converting capacity of approximately twelve million cases  our in house production of parent rolls provides enough capacity to convert approximately ten million cases 
in order to convert at an annual capacity above approximately ten million cases  we must supplement our supplies by purchasing parent rolls in the open market

net sales of converted product decreased million in the year ended december   or  to million compared to million in net sales of parent rolls increased million in the year  or  to million when compared to the same period in the decrease in converted product sales was primarily due to lower converted product shipment volumes of in the year compared to the year 
net selling prices per ton in were slightly unfavorable with those experienced in  lower by approximately 
the lower converted product shipment volumes were primarily the result of continued aggressive promotional pricing by branded producers which negatively affected our shipment volumes with certain customers 
parent roll sales benefited from the lower requirements of our converting operations which resulted in more excess parent roll tons being available for sale 
the increase in parent roll sales was mainly due to an increase in tonnage shipped and to a lesser extent  a increase in net sales price per ton 
net sales for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  sales figures include gross selling price  including freight  less discounts and sales promotions 
net sales of converted product increased million in the year ended december   or  to million compared to million in net sales of parent rolls decreased million in the year  or  to million when compared to the same period in the increase in converted product sales was due to an increase in the net selling price per ton of over the prior year and a volume increase of 
the increase in net selling price per ton of converted product was the result of price increases and product content changes that occurred during and early the increased tonnage shipped was due to continued efficiency improvements in our converting lines which provided more products to sell in the marketplace 
the decrease in parent roll sales was due to a decrease in tonnage shipped and a decrease in net sales price per ton 
increased parent roll requirements in our converting operation as well as a soft parent roll market  primarily due to a soft away from home market  where we sell a majority of our parent rolls  were reasons for the lower tonnage shipments 
net selling prices of parent rolls were affected by both the soft parent roll market and lower waste paper costs

cost of sales for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million in the year ended december  this increase in cost of sales was primarily attributable to higher cost of waste paper  higher converted products costs and higher depreciation expense  which was partially offset by decreased external warehouse expense 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was in the period compared to in the period 
cost of sales as a percent of net sales was negatively affected by higher paper production costs and an unfavorable sales mix shift from converted products to parent rolls 
paper production costs were per ton in the year ended december   an increase of per ton compared to per ton in the period 
paper production costs increased primarily due to higher waste paper prices 
our cost of waste paper in the year ended december  increased approximately compared to the same period of  which increased our cost of sales by approximately million 
following a sharp decrease in waste paper prices in the first half of  waste paper prices began to rise in the third quarter of and continued to rise through mid year waste paper prices have been relatively flat during the last half of depreciation expense increased primarily due to placing the assets associated with our converting expansion project into service in the beginning of the third quarter of largely due to lower converting production requirements and  to a lesser extent  additional staffing for our new converting line  converting production costs increased in the year compared with the same period of external warehousing costs decreased by approximately  in the year compared to the year due to the phasing out of a third party warehouse during the third quarter of usage of a third party warehouse ended in september and we have been warehousing and shipping all converted product from our pryor  oklahoma location since that time 
cost of sales for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million in the year ended december  our cost of sales were positively affected by a decrease in waste paper and energy costs  as well as lower direct labor costs in converting and lower packaging costs 
these improvements were partially offset by higher converting overhead costs and higher depreciation expense 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales improved to in the period compared to in the period 
cost of sales as a percent of net sales was favorably affected by higher net sales prices  lower paper production costs  lower converting direct labor costs and lower packaging costs 

table of contents paper production costs were per ton in the year ended december   a decrease of per ton compared to per ton in the period 
paper production costs decreased primarily due to lower waste paper prices and  to a lesser extent  lower natural gas costs 
waste paper prices decreased significantly in the first half of following a strong run up in prices beginning during and peaking in early fourth quarter of beginning in july  our cost of waste paper has increased on a monthly basis through march our cost of waste paper in the year ended december  decreased approximately compared to our costs in as a result  our cost of waste paper decreased million in compared to direct labor costs in our converting operation in the year ended december  were lower than the same period in by on a per unit basis due to both the reduced headcount resulting from our automation project completed in the first quarter of and higher productivity 
the lower labor costs contributed approximately million to the increase in gross profit 
this cost reduction was partially offset by higher converting overhead costs 
converting overhead costs in the year ended december  increased by approximately million compared to the same period in the increase was primarily due to higher third party warehousing costs and higher salaried labor costs being partially offset by the absence of the productivity consultant expenses incurred in and lower maintenance and repair costs 
the costs of third party warehousing increased by  due to a full year of utilization in compared to a partial year in and due to higher inventory levels 
we began utilizing a third party warehouse in the first quarter of to increase our shipping capacity and provide better customer service to handle our increasing converting product shipments 
labor costs increased approximately  primarily due to additions to the operating team 
in  a productivity consultant was hired to assist our converting operations team in improving production efficiencies at a cost of  those costs were not repeated in maintenance and repair costs were lower in  compared to  by approximately  depreciation expense increased primarily due to the converting automation project and the waste water treatment project assets being placed in service during gross profit gross profit decreased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to in compared to in the gross profit decrease was primarily due to higher waste paper prices  lower converted product shipments  which also caused an increase in per case converting production costs  a higher percentage of lower margin parent roll sales  and higher depreciation expense 
as a result of the decreased converting product sales  more tonnage was sold as parent rolls 
this change in product mix negatively affects our gross profit because sales of converted products typically carry a higher margin than sales of parent rolls 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to in compared to in the gross profit increase was associated with lower paper production costs mainly due to lower waste paper prices and  to a lesser extent  lower natural gas prices  lower converting direct labor  and lower packaging costs 
also  contributing to the increase in gross profit was an increase in converted product tonnage shipped as well as increased net selling prices 
as a result of our increased converting production  more tonnage was consumed in our converting operation rather than being sold as parent rolls 
this change in product mix positively affected our gross profit due to the higher margins generally obtained through sales of converted product compared with margins obtained through parent roll sales

liquidity and capital resources overview liquidity refers to the liquid financial assets available to fund our business operations and pay for near term obligations 
these liquid financial assets consist of cash and short term investments 
our cash requirements have historically been satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations and debt financings 
on july   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock  which included the exercise in full of the underwriter option to purchase  shares of common stock to cover overallotments 
net proceeds from the offering were million 
following the offering   shares of common stock  par value 
per share  were outstanding 
in july  we effected a for stock split increasing the shares of common stock outstanding to  shares outstanding 
we completed the public offering primarily to help implement our strategy to eliminate our need at that time to purchase paper from third party suppliers through the purchase and installation of a new paper machine 
the funding from the public offering  additional bank financing and cash flow from operations funded the million project 
in  we completed a follow on stock offering that provided million in net proceeds 
the offering consisted of the sale of  shares of common stock at an offering price of per share 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the offering along with cash from operations  and a 
table of contents construction loan to fund a million converting expansion project  comprised of a million new converting line and a million new finished goods warehouse 
as of december   we had cash on hand of  and million in short term investments  compared to million and million as of december   respectively 
on february   we initiated a quarterly cash dividend policy and authorized a payment of per outstanding share of our common stock 
the aggregate amount of this dividend pay will be approximately  the dividend policy was approved and the initial payment amount established based on our board of directors review of our expected future cash flows  our balance sheet leverage and future capital requirements 
our board will evaluate the appropriate dividend payment on a quarterly basis 
capital expenditures are estimated at million in for normal recurring capital expenses 
as of december   approximately million was recorded as a federal income tax receivable 
the receivable resulted from the extension of the eligibility period for bonus depreciation  which eliminated our federal tax liability for the extension occurred after deposits of million were made for the first three quarters of in addition  we now estimate a federal tax loss for  resulting in a million carryback to tax year a refund of the million overpayment is expected by the end of the first quarter of we estimate the state of oklahoma nol carryforward at million  which is available to offset future oklahoma income tax liability 
we expect to claim  in oitc for related to the paper machine purchased in we expect to generate an additional oitc of  associated with our million converting expansion project 
the oitc carryforward is expected to grow over the next four years as it is earned ratably over five years at two percent per year on qualified investments 
these oitc credits will likely eliminate all oklahoma income tax liability for the next few years 
the following table summarizes key cash flow information for the years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flows provided by operating activities decreased from million in to million in a decrease in cash earnings of million and a million income tax receivable were the main drivers 
cash flows used in investing activities decreased million in  primarily due to million in sales of investment securities compared to million in net purchases in capital expenditures increased million from million in to million in the sale of the securities provided funding for a portion of our converting expansion project 
capital project expenditures for consisted of million for the new converting line  million for the finished goods warehouse and million for the expansion of the waste water treatment plant 
cash flows provided by financing activities was million in  primarily attributable to million in borrowings under a construction loan for the warehouse portion of the converting expansion project  million in net borrowings on the revolving credit line which were partially offset by million in principal payments on our bank term loans 

table of contents cash flows provided by operating activities increased million to million in an increase in cash earnings of million and an increase in deferred income tax expense were the main drivers 
cash flows used in investing activities increased million in  primarily due to million in net purchases of investment securities and million invested in capital equipment projects 
investments in short term securities was primarily the result of our follow on offering and  to a lesser extent  cash generated from operations 
capital project expenditures in were primarily comprised of million in payments for the initial order of our new converting line  million on the previously announced waste water treatment project  which was completed in  and million in progress payments on the construction of our new warehouse 
cash flows provided by financing activities was million in  primarily attributable to the million in proceeds from our follow on offering and to a lesser extent million for borrowings under our construction loan to complete the waste water treatment project 
these cash inflows were partially offset by million in normally scheduled principal payments on bank term loans as well as million payoff of the revolving credit line 
cash flows from operating activities increased  to million in an increase in cash earnings of approximately million was mostly offset by working capital changes in  particularly  increased accounts receivable and inventory levels of approximately million and the absence of the realization in of million in carryback claims for federal taxes paid in and accounts receivable increased due to increased sales levels 
inventory increased due to higher levels of parent roll inventory and overall increased sales levels 
cash flows used in investing activities increased million in  primarily due to increased expenditures on capital projects of million

this project was completed in february and the remaining  of expenditures were incurred in the first quarter of cash flows used in financing was million in  primarily attributable to million in normally scheduled principal payments on our bank term loans which was partially offset by an approximate  increase in our revolving credit facility 
on april   we re financed our existing credit facility with the existing bank group 
the facility was amended from time to time 
following the amendments  the credit facility consists of the following at december  a million revolving credit facility due april  million outstanding at december   a million term loan a with a ten year term due april  no principal repayments for the first months and then amortized as if it had an year life million outstanding at december   a million term loan b with a four year term due april and is being amortized as if it had a six year life million outstanding at december   a million capital expenditures facility with a four year term due november that will be amortized as if it had a five year life million outstanding at december   and a million construction loan with a seven year term due october  interest only payments through december   and then amortized as if it had a year life million outstanding at december  
table of contents term loan b and the revolving credit facility carry terminations of april  and accordingly  the outstanding balances of these two loans of million and million  respectively have been classified as current obligations in the accompanying balance sheet 
we are currently in negotiations regarding the extension or renegotiation of a new credit facility  which we expect to complete before the april termination date 
all loans are assessed at the same libor margins  and include a all in interest rate floor 
the interest rate is the higher of i the libor rate for the applicable interest period plus the margin  or ii per annum 
the margin is set quarterly and based on the ratio of funded debt to ebitda less income tax paid 
the margins range from to basis points over libor or daily floating libor 
the credit agreement contains covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain a specific funded debt to ebitda ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio  a quarterly tangible net worth calculation  and an annual limit on unfunded capital expenditures which are tested as of the end of each quarter 
the calculation of each ratio is specifically defined in the agreement we believe the most significant covenants under our credit facility are the funded debt to ebitda ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio and the minimum tangible net worth 
the table below compares the actual ratios with the limits specified in the credit agreement 
actual as of required in credit agreement excess funded debt to ebitda fixed charge coverage ratio tangible net worth the amount available under the revolving credit line may be reduced in the event that our borrowing base  which is based upon our qualified receivables and qualified inventory  is less than million 
as of december   our qualified receivables were million and our qualified inventory was million which yielded a total borrowing base of million 
our revolving loan balance at the end of the year was million 
the available revolving credit agreement at the end of the year was million 
obligations under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the credit agreement contains representations and warranties  and affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type 
if an event of default occurs  the agent may declare the banks obligation to make loans terminated and all outstanding indebtedness  and all other amounts payable under the credit agreement  due and payable 
contractual obligations as of december   our contractual cash obligations were our long term debt and associated interest  and natural gas contract 
we do not have any leasing commitments or debt guarantees outstanding as of december  we do not have any defined benefit pension plans or any obligation to fund any postretirement benefit obligations for our work force 

table of contents maturities of these contractual obligations consist of the following payments due by period years contractual cash obligations total and and after in thousands long term debt interest payments natural gas contract total under our revolving credit and term loan agreements  the maturity of outstanding debt could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain financial covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with our loan covenants 
the revolving credit line as well as term loan b mature in april and  are included in the year obligation section 
these amounts assume interest payments at the year end borrowing amount 
the amount borrowed in future years is dependent on our free cash flow from time to time 
the year obligation includes term loan b for  which will be paid off in april interest payments on the term loans have been calculated based on the interest rate in effect as of december  in october  we entered into a contract to purchase  mmbtu per year of natural gas requirements at per mmbtu plus a per mmbtu management fee for the period from april through march in november  we extended the contract to purchase  mmbtu at per mmbtu plus a per mmbtu management fee for the period from april through march in august of  the agreement was extended another year to march with a contract price of per mmbtu plus a per mmbtu management fee 
the amounts represent approximately of our natural gas requirements based on usage rates for if we are unable to purchase the contracted amounts and the market price at that time is less than the contracted price  we would be obligated under the terms of our agreement to reimburse an amount equal to the volume purchased that was less than the contracted amount multiplied by the difference between our contract price and current spot price 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements accounts receivable 
accounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from normal business activities 
our management must make estimates of accounts receivable that will not be collected 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer creditworthiness as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that 
table of contents we have identified 
trade receivables are written off when all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted  including  but not limited to  external third party collection efforts and litigation 
while such credit losses have historically been within management expectations and the provisions established  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
accounts receivable balances that have been written off  net of recoveries  in the year ended december   and were   and  respectively 
inventory 
our inventory consists of converted finished goods  bulk paper rolls and raw materials and is based on standard cost  specific identification  or fifo first in  first out 
standard costs approximate actual costs on a first in  first out basis 
material  labor and factory overhead necessary to produce the inventories are included in the standard cost 
our management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on the age of the inventory and forecasts of product demand 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
our inventory is monitored each quarter and all potential obsolete items due to product appearance change were written off during the current year 
during the year ended december   we increased the inventory valuation reserve by  during we decreased the reserve by  the decrease in reserve in was due to a lower number of product content changes implemented in and in process as of december  new accounting pronouncements refer to the discussion of recently adopted issued accounting pronouncements under
