table of contents executive summary and financial highlights we are a global power leader that designs  manufactures  distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines  electric power generation systems and engine related component products  including filtration  exhaust aftertreatment  fuel systems  controls and air handling systems 
we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems  distributors and other customers worldwide 
we have long standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve  including paccar inc  chrysler group  llc  daimler trucks north america  man nutzfahrzeuge ag  ford motor company  komatsu  volvo ab and case new holland 
we serve our customers through a network of more than company owned and independent distributor locations and approximately  dealer locations in more than countries and territories 
our reportable operating segments consist of the following engine  power generation  components and distribution 
this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers 
the engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on highway and various industrial markets 
the engines are used in trucks of all sizes  buses and recreational vehicles  as well as various industrial applications including construction  mining  agriculture  marine  oil and gas  rail and military 
the power generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines  generator sets and alternators 
the components segment sells filtration products  exhaust aftertreatment systems  turbochargers and fuel systems 
the distribution segment includes wholly owned and partially owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines  generator sets and service parts  as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world 
our financial performance depends  in large part  on varying conditions in the markets we serve  particularly the on highway  construction and general industrial markets 
demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels and our customers access to credit 
our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages 
economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products 
as a worldwide business  our operations are also affected by political  economic and regulatory matters  including environmental and emission standards  in the countries we serve 
at the same time  our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results 
in  emerging markets recovered with stronger demand in china  india and brazil  while we started to see modest but uneven signs of recovery in developed markets 
as we expected  after the strong demand in the second half of  in advance of the united states us emission change  demand for heavy duty on highway products in north america decreased approximately percent in versus in addition  medium duty truck shipments in north america decreased percent in versus excluding north american on highway markets  overall order trends improved and were consistent with our expectations of organic revenue growth in in recognition of the global economic challenges  we launched significant restructuring initiatives in late and that were designed to reduce structural and overhead costs across all of our businesses  improve operational performance  strengthen our position in emerging markets and prepare to capitalize on the eventual recovery in north america and europe 
these initiatives helped to mitigate the adverse volume impacts that certain markets experienced and they better position us for when a more robust economic recovery extends beyond the emerging markets 
despite the slow recovery in the us markets and europe  we were able to operate much more efficiently and  as a result  recorded the most profitable results in our history in

liquidity and capital resources management assessment of liquidity our financial condition and liquidity remain strong 
our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit as we terminated our three year credit facility a year early and entered into a new four year credit facility during we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity 
as of december   other sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents of  million  of which approximately percent is located in the us and percent is located in the united kingdom uk  china  singapore  brazil and india  marketable securities of million  which are located primarily in india and brazil and the majority of which could be liquidated into cash within a few days  revolving credit facility with billion available  net of outstanding letters of credit  international and other domestic credit facilities with million available and 
table of contents accounts receivable sales program with million available  based on eligible receivables 
we believe our liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital  capital expenditures  projected pension obligations  dividend payments  common stock repurchases and debt service obligations 
on july   we entered into a new four year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders which provides us with a billion unsecured revolving credit facility  the proceeds of which are to be used for the general corporate purposes of cummins 
see note  debt to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the credit agreement includes two financial covenants a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio 
at december   we were in compliance with both financial covenants 
the required leverage ratio  which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the four fiscal quarters should not exceed to at december   our leverage using this measure was to the required interest coverage ratio  which is consolidated ebitda minus capital expenditures to consolidated interest expense  in each case for the four consecutive fiscal quarters  should not be less than to at december   our interest coverage ratio using this measure was to we continuously monitor our pension assets and believe that we have limited exposure to the european debt crisis 
no sovereign debt instruments of crisis countries are held in the trusts  while any equities held are with large  well diversified multinational firms or are de minimus amounts in large index funds 
in addition  we have rebalanced our asset portfolio in the us and us with equities representing a smaller segment of the total portfolios 
our pension plans have not experienced any significant impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets 
a significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the us more than half of our cash and cash equivalents and most of our marketable securities at december   are denominated in foreign currencies 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences  however  those balances are generally available  without legal restrictions  to fund ordinary business operations at the local level 
we have and will continue to transfer cash from these subsidiaries to us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 
the maturity schedule of our existing long term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term 
required annual principal payments range from million to million over each of the next five years

application of critical accounting estimates a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which often requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements 
management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience  changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in any given reporting period  our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies  related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs  recoverability of investment related to new products  accounting for income taxes  pension benefits and annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill 
warranty programs we estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold 
our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ 
as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall 
table of contents programs  the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action  which generally occurs when it is announced 
our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates  repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle 
future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability 
new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available 
product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch  with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch 
we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding product warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation 
we then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters  and new product specific experience thereafter 
note  product warranty liability  to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for and including adjustments to pre existing warranties 
recoverability of investment related to new products at december   we have capitalized million associated with the future launch of our light duty diesel engine product 
development of this product began in market uncertainty related to the global recession that began in resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs 
at december   we reviewed our investment of million for possible impairment 
we used projections to assess whether future cash flows on an undiscounted basis related to the assets are likely to exceed the related carrying amount to determine if a write down is appropriate 
these projections required estimates about product volume and the size of the market for vehicles that are not yet developed 
we used input from our customers in developing alternative cash flow scenarios 
our analysis indicated that the assets were recoverable 
customers that are expected to purchase sufficient quantities to recover our investment in the light duty diesel engine products remained active with the development of this product through and there were no significant changes to the assumptions used in if customer expectations or projected volumes deteriorate and we do not identify alternative customers and or product applications  we could be required to write down these assets to net realizable value 
accounting for income taxes we determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we recorded net deferred tax assets of million 
these assets included million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance of million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized 
in the event our operating performance deteriorates  future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
we reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available 
a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and 
table of contents credit carryforwards is disclosed in note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements 
pension benefits we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the us and the uk and to a lesser degree in various other countries 
in the uk and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded 
we account for our pension programs in accordance with employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under gaap 
gaap requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis 
as a result  our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at december these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities  assumed rates of return on plan assets  future compensation increases  employee turnover rates  actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age  mortality rates and participant withdrawals 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions  participant life span and withdrawal rates 
these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future 
the expected long term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense 
we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets 
the long term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a year average market value of return 
projected returns are based primarily on broad  publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forward looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management 
as of december   based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the year projection period equal to or in excess of percent approximately percent of the time while returns of percent or greater are anticipated percent of the time 
we expect additional positive returns from active investment management 
the one year return exceeded percent  combined with the very favorable returns in has eliminated the significant deterioration in pension assets experienced in as a result of the credit crisis and related market recession 
based on the historical returns and forward looking return expectations  we believe an investment return assumption of percent per year in for us pension assets is reasonable 
the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equity risk premium over current long term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations 
as of december   based upon our target asset allocations  it is anticipated that our uk investment policy will generate an average annual return over the year projection period equal to or in excess of percent approximately percent of the time while returns of percent or greater are anticipated percent of the time 
we expect additional positive returns from active investment management 
the one year return for our uk plan was percent for and similar to our us plan  the market related deterioration in our plan assets has been eliminated 
our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long term outlook 
therefore  the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long term horizon 
based on the historical returns and forward looking return expectations  we believe an investment return 
table of contents assumption of percent in for uk pension assets is reasonable 
our pension plan asset allocation at december  and and target allocation for are as follows us plans us plans percentage of plan assets at december  percentage of plan assets at december  target allocation target allocation investment description equity securities fixed income real estate other total the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years 
the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period and our expected rate for long term expected return assumptions us plans non us plans a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and  under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation pbo  amortized over future years of service 
this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions 
as of december   we had net pension actuarial losses of million and million for the us and us pension plans  respectively 
under gaap  the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
decreases in actuarial losses increased our shareholders equity by million after tax in the decreases resulted from improved plan asset performance in as these amounts exceed percent of our pbo  the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees 
the table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period through and our expected expense for net periodic pension expense in millions pension expense we expect pension expense to be slightly under  due to strong returns and higher assets  partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate 
the decrease in periodic pension expense in  was due to improved returns on assets as the capital markets began to recover  strong contributions in and the absence of any curtailment charges 
the increase in periodic pension expense in was due to lower than historical returns on assets driven by the global economic recession 
another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate 
the 
table of contents weighted average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below 
discount rates us plans non us plans changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in gaap which suggests the use of a high quality corporate bond rate 
we used bond information provided by moody  standard poors  fitch and dominion bond rating 
all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and uk were high quality  non callable bonds aa or better as of december  the average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to gaap for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
our model called for years of benefit payments for the us plans and years of payments for the uk for both countries  our model matches the present value of the plan projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio 
a single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio 
the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan distinct liability characteristics 
the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 
in millions impact on pension expense increase decrease discount rate used to value liabilities percent increase percent decrease expected rate of return on assets percent increase percent decrease the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense 
a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense 
it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear

table of contents annual assessment for recoverability of goodwill under gaap for goodwill and other intangible assets  the carrying value of goodwill must be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances where impairment may be indicated 
the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions 
in accordance with gaap  our reporting units are generally defined as one level below an operating segment 
however  there were two situations where we have aggregated two or more components which share similar economic characteristics and thus are aggregated into a single reporting unit for testing purposes 
these two situations are described further below 
this analysis has resulted in the following reporting units for our goodwill testing within our components segment  emission solutions and filtration have been aggregated into a single reporting unit 
this reporting unit accounts for almost percent of our total goodwill balance at december  also within our components segment  our turbo technologies business is considered a separate reporting unit 
within our power generation segment  our generator technologies business is considered a separate reporting unit 
within our engine segment  our new and recon parts business is considered a separate reporting unit 
this reporting unit is in the business of selling new parts and remanufacturing and reconditioning engines and certain engine components 
our distribution segment is considered a single reporting unit as it is managed geographically and all regions share similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services 
no other reporting units have goodwill 
our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue  operating expenses  working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multi year period 
additionally  management must estimate a weighted average cost of capital  which reflects a market rate  for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate 
the discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and  if less than the carrying value  a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred 
in addition  we also perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how much our forecasts can fluctuate before the fair value of a reporting unit would be lower than its carrying amount 
as of the end of the third quarter in  we performed the annual impairment assessment required by gaap and determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
at december   our recorded goodwill was million  approximately percent of which resided in the emission solutions plus filtration reporting unit 
for this reporting unit  the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin 
changes in our projections or estimates  a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill 

table of contents recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements accounting pronouncements recently adopted in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its standards regarding the disclosures for credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
the objective of the amendment is to provide a greater level of disaggregated information about the credit quality of financing receivables  the allowance for credit losses  and timely recognition of such losses 
specifically  the amendment requires an entity to disclose credit quality indicators  past due information and modifications of its financing receivables 
the new rules are effective for us beginning december  our level of receivables that qualify as financing receivables  as defined by the standard  are not material for disclosure 
in january  the fasb amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures  which are effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after december   except for disclosures about certain level activity which will not become effective until interim and annual periods beginning after december  the new standard requires us to disclose transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers as well as activity in level fair value measurements 
the new standard also requires a more detailed level of disaggregation of the assets and liabilities being measured as well as increased disclosures regarding inputs and valuation techniques of the fair value measurements 
our disclosures related to the new standard are included in note  fair value of financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb amended its standards for accounting for transfers of financial assets  which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after november  the new standard removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity from gaap 
the new standard modifies the financial components approach used in previous standards and limits the circumstances in which a financial asset  or portion of a financial asset  should be derecognized 
the new standard also requires enhanced disclosure regarding transfers of financial interests and a transferor continuing involvement with transferred assets 
the new standard requires us to report any activity under our receivable sales program as secured borrowings 
as of december   there were no outstanding amounts under our receivable sales program and there was no significant activity during the year 
in june  the fasb amended its existing standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities  which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after november  the new standard requires entities to analyze whether their variable interests give it a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity vie and outlines what defines a primary beneficiary 
the new standard amends gaap by a changing certain rules for determining whether an entity is a vie  b replacing the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary with a more qualitative approach  and c requiring entities to continuously analyze whether they are the primary beneficiary of a vie among other amendments 
the new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an entity involvement in a vie 
the only significant impact of the adoption of this standard was to deconsolidate cummins komatsu engine corporation ckec as of january  and to account for ckec under gaap for equity method investees 
ckec is an engine manufacturing entity jointly owned and operated by us and our equity partner 
prior to january   we were deemed the primary beneficiary of this vie due to the pricing arrangements of purchases and the substantial volume of purchases we made from the vie 
the impact of the deconsolidation on our consolidated statements of income was minimal as all sales were eliminated in consolidation in the past 
the most significant impacts on our consolidated balance sheets were to decrease current assets by million  decrease long term assets by million  increase investments and advances related to equity method investees by million and decrease noncontrolling interest by million 

table of contents accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective in october  the fasb amended its rules regarding the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements 
the objective of the amendment is to allow vendors to account for revenue for different deliverables separately as opposed to part of a combined unit when those deliverables are provided at different times 
specifically  this amendment addresses how to separate deliverables and simplifies the process of allocating revenue to the different deliverables when more than one deliverable exists 
the new rules are effective for us beginning january  we do not believe this amendment will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts  commodity swap contracts and interest rate swaps 
as stated in our policies and procedures  financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes  and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes 
when material  we adjust the value of our derivative contracts for counter party or our credit risk 
the results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis 
further information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in note  derivatives  to our consolidated financial statements 
the following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analysis performed as of december  the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous  parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
foreign exchange rates as a result of our international business presence  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks 
we transact business in foreign currencies and  as a result  our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
to help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility  we use foreign exchange forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and third party sales and purchases denominated in non functional currencies 
our internal policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flows for up to one year 
these foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under gaap 
the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the forward contract is deferred and reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl 
when the hedged forecasted transaction sale or purchase occurs  the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income 
the ineffective portion of the hedge  unrealized gain or loss  if any  is recognized in current income during the period of change 
as of december   the amount we expect to reclassify from aocl to income over the next year is a net unrealized loss of million 
for the years ended december  and  there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge 
to minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  which are considered economic hedges 
the objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract 
these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under gaap 
as of december   the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts  assuming a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts  
table of contents would be approximately million 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next months 
the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels 
it should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note  derivatives  to our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps 
the objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our million debt issue  due in  from a fixed rate of to a floating rate based on a libor spread 
the terms of the swap mirror those of the debt  with interest paid semi annually 
this swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under gaap 
the gain or loss on this derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as interest expense 
the following table summarizes these gains and losses for the years presented below for the years ended december  in millions gain loss on swaps gain loss on borrowings gain loss on swaps gain loss on borrowings income statement classification interest expense commodity price risk we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers 
in order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and  consequently  fluctuations in gross margins  we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations 
the swap contracts are derivative contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges under gaap 
the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss is deferred and reported as a component of aocl 
when the hedged forecasted transaction purchase occurs  the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income 
the ineffective portion of the hedge  if any  is recognized in current income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs 
as of december   we expect to reclassify an unrealized net gain of million from aocl to income over the next year 
for the year ended december   there were no material circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a cash flow hedge 
for the year ended december   we discontinued hedge accounting on certain contracts where the forecasted transactions were no longer probable 
the amount reclassified to income as a result of this action was a loss of million 
our internal policy allows for managing these cash flow hedges for up to three years 
as of december   the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts  assuming a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities  was million 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next months 
the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels 
it should be noted that any change in the value of the swap contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note  derivatives  to the consolidated financial statements
