table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business outlook the current economic environment in the united states remains very challenging 
our primary products are provided to workers employed by our customers and  as a result  our business prospects are dependent upon levels of employment among other factors 
our revenues are impacted by the opening and closing of locations by our customers and reductions and increases in headcount by our customers 
additionally  voluntary employee turnover has been reduced significantly as a result of fewer alternative jobs available to employees of our customers 
fewer available jobs coupled with less attrition results in decreased demand for our uniforms and service apparel 
our focus is geared towards mitigating these factors in the current economic environment and has included the following strategies 
we are actively pursuing acquisitions to increase our market share in the image apparel business 
we completed the acquisition of blade uniforms in november and this resulted in increased revenues of approximately million in it is our intention to continue to seek additional acquisitions that fit into our image apparel business in the future 
secondly  we have diversified our business model to include a sector providing call center services to other businesses 
this business sector was initially started to provide these services for the company at a lower cost structure in order to improve our own operating results 
this call center operation  located in el salvador and costa rica  has enabled us to reduce our operating expenses and to more effectively service our customers needs 
we began selling these services to other companies at the end of and as a result  we have grown this business from approximately  in annual revenues in to approximately million in net sales to outside customers in we are aggressively marketing this service to others at this point and see this area as a growth sector in and beyond 
finally  we are pursuing new product lines to enhance our market position in the image apparel business 
toward this end  we entered into a new licensing agreement in january of this new licensing agreement provides us with access to patented technology which will allow us to market image apparel to our customers that will provide them with the ability to turn their uniforms from an expense item into point of sale advertisements that will  in turn  give them the ability to generate advertising revenues for their businesses 
we believe that this new product line will provide us with the opportunity for significant growth in our image apparel business in the future 
we expect to begin generating revenues from this new product line in the fourth quarter of during the latter part of  cotton prices began increasing dramatically and recently reached historical highs due to weather related and other supply disruptions  which when combined with robust global demand  particularly in asia  has created concerns about availability in addition to increased costs for our products 
while we have been able to pass on a portion of these price increases to our customers  we expect that this could negatively impact our gross margins in operations net sales increased from  in to  in approximately million of increased sales came from the acquisition of blade in the fourth quarter of additionally  our net sales from our call center operations increased by approximately  these increases were offset by a decrease of million in net sales as one of our customers eliminated their uniform program in this customer provided net sales in of approximately  prior to the termination of the program 
as a percentage of sales  cost of goods sold was in  and in the percentage decrease in as compared to is primarily attributed to improved sourcing of product during late and the first half of the company s gross margins may not be comparable with other entities  since some entities include all of the cost related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company includes a portion of the costs associated with its distribution network in selling and administrative expenses 
the amounts included in selling and administrative expenses for each of the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses were in and in the increase in percentage in as compared to is attributed to higher salaries  wages and benefits as a percentage of net sales in 
the increase in salaries  wages and benefits as a percentage of sales is attributed to higher incentive earnings in the current year as a result of improved operating results 
this increase was offset by higher net sales to cover operating expenses 
the effective income tax rate in was and in was 
the increase in such effective tax rate is attributed primarily to the following a reduction in the benefit for untaxed foreign income  and the impact of other items 
the reduction in the benefit for untaxed foreign income is attributed to the overall higher pre tax income earned by the company in during the years ended december  and  the company did not recognize deferred income taxes on foreign income of  and  respectively  
table of contents due to the fact that these amounts are considered to be reinvested indefinitely in the foreign subsidiaries 
we do not expect to receive a significant benefit from untaxed foreign income in unless we end up making significant additional investments in those subsidiaries 
therefore  our effective tax rate will likely increase in liquidity and capital resources the company uses a number of standards for its own purposes in measuring its liquidity  such as working capital  profitability ratios  long term debt as a percentage of long term debt and equity  and activity ratios 
the company s balance sheet is very strong at this point and provides it with the ability to pursue acquisitions  to invest in new product lines and technologies  and to invest in additional working capital as necessary 
the company has no debt outstanding at december  additionally  we have a million revolving credit facility available for use in the event we should need it

the company maintains title to the raw materials in central america 
this change in operations led to the decrease in other receivables 
inventories decreased from  on december  to  as of december  the decrease is a result of the timing of receipts of inventory

in addition to the contributions  the plans earned  on their assets in these reductions in the net liability were offset by interest and service costs of  as well as the impact of a reduction in the year end discount rate on the plans from at december  to to at december  this change in the discount rates increased the year end liability by approximately  at december   the working capital of the company was approximately  and the working capital ratio was the working capital of the company at december  was approximately  and the working capital ratio was the company has operated without hindrance or restraint with its present working capital  believing that income generated from operations and outside sources of credit  both trade and institutional  are more than adequate to fund the company s operations

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates that we have made 
these estimates are based upon our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting estimates are those that we believe require our most significant judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a discussion of our critical accounting estimates  the underlying judgments and uncertainties used to make them and the likelihood that materially different estimates would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions is as follows allowance for losses on accounts receivable these allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire customer pool 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
an additional impairment in value of one percent of net accounts receivable would require an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts and would result in additional expense of approximately  the company s concentration of risk is also monitored and at year end  one customer had an account balance greater than of receivables and the five largest customer account balances totaled  additionally  the company advances funds for 
table of contents certain of its suppliers to purchase raw materials 
the company deducts payment for these raw materials from payments made to the suppliers upon completion of the related finished goods 
the company had a receivables balance from one of its suppliers located in haiti totaling approximately  at december  this amount is included in accounts receivable other on the consolidated balance sheet 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to customers 
historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both excess and obsolete inventories 
if actual product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
insurance the company self insures for certain obligations related to health insurance programs 
the company also purchases stop loss insurance policies to protect it from catastrophic losses 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for losses that have occurred  but have not been reported 
the company s estimates consider historical claim experience and other factors 
the company s liabilities are based on estimates  and  while the company believes that the accrual for loss is adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amounts recorded 
changes in claim experience  the company s ability to settle claims or other estimates and judgments used by management could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any period 
pensions the company s pension obligations are determined using estimates including those related to discount rates  asset values and changes in compensation 
the discount rates used for the company s pension plans of to were determined based on the citigroup pension yield curve 
this rate was selected as the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled on the measurement date taking into account the nature and duration of the benefit obligations of the plan using high quality fixed income investments currently available rated aa or better and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
the expected return on plan assets was determined based on historical long term investment returns as well as future expectations given target investment asset allocations and current economic conditions 
the rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases in salaries among continuing active participants accruing benefits under the plans 
in  a reduction in the expected return on plan assets of would have resulted in additional expense of approximately  while a reduction in the discount rate of would have resulted in additional expense of approximately  and would have reduced the funded status by  for the company s defined benefit pension plans 
interest rates and pension plan valuations may vary significantly based on worldwide economic conditions and asset investment decisions 
income taxes the company is required to estimate and record income taxes payable for federal and state jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing accounting treatment between tax and book that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  accruals are also estimated for federal and state tax matters for which deductibility is subject to interpretation 
taxes payable and the related deferred tax differences may be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes in tax rates and changes in taxable profits and losses 
federal income taxes are not provided on that portion of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are expected to be reinvested indefinitely 
reserves are also estimated for uncertain tax positions that are currently unresolved 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of such situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
for the year ending december   we recognized a net increase in total unrecognized tax benefits of approximately  as of december   we had an accrued liability of  for unrecognized tax benefits 
we accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense  and the related liability is included in the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
share based compensation the company recognizes expense for all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  in the financial statements based on their fair values 
share based compensation expense that was recorded in and includes the compensation expense for the share based payments granted in those years 
in the company s share based compensation strategy we utilize a combination of stock options and stock appreciation rights sars that fully vest on the date of grant 
therefore  the fair value of the options and sars granted is recognized as expense on the date of grant 
the company used the black scholes merton valuation model to value any share based compensation 
option valuation methods  including black scholes merton  require the input of 
table of contents assumptions including the risk free interest rate  dividend rate  expected term and volatility rate
