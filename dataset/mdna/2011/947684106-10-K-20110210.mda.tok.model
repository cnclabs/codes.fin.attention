the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere  including under item a risk factors of this annual report on form k 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as applying to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this annual report on form k 
restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements we have restated our previously reported consolidated balance sheet at december  and the statement of stockholders equity at january  and related disclosures  to record the write off of a million tax asset that originated from an error in a calculation when we changed our tax method of accounting for deferred revenue in the error resulted in our reporting overstated deferred tax assets of approximately million in our financial statements for fiscal years through in  we reclassified a portion of the error amount from deferred tax assets to income tax receivable because of a belief at the time that the error amount was related to monthly to daily revenue adjustments for fiscal years through and  therefore  would be recoverable by amending our tax returns for those years 
we subsequently discovered the error amount was instead related to an error in the calculation of the deferred tax assets when we changed the tax method of accounting for deferred revenue in the statute of limitations to claim a refund for the tax year expired in september after evaluating various tax planning strategies  management determined that there is substantial uncertainty as to whether it will be able to recover the error amount based on case law 
as a result  we have concluded that we need to restate our financial statements to reflect the write off of the million deferred tax asset and our and financial statements to reflect the write off of the tax asset and retained earnings balances 
the restatements had no impact on the financial statement amounts previously reported for our revenues  operating costs and expenses  net income loss and cash flows from operations for the years ended december  and  or for the nine months ended september   or any quarterly periods from january  through september  overview we are a global provider of unified web  data and email content security solutions designed to protect data and users from modern cyber threats  information leaks  legal liability and productivity loss 
we provide our solutions as software installed on standard server hardware  as software pre installed on optimized appliances  as a cloud based service software as a service or saas offering  or in a hybrid appliance saas configuration 
our products and services are sold worldwide to public sector entities  enterprise customers  small and medium sized businesses smbs  and internet service providers through a network of value added resellers and original equipment manufacturer oem arrangements 

table of contents our portfolio of web security  data security and email content security solutions allows organizations to prevent access to undesirable and dangerous elements on the web  such as web sites that contain inappropriate content or sites that download viruses  spyware  keyloggers or other varieties of malicious code  protect from spam  inappropriate content and malware embedded in user generated content on web sites  prevent unauthorized use and leaks of sensitive data  such as customer or employee information  identify and remove malware from incoming web content  filter spam from incoming email  filter viruses and other malicious attachments from email and instant messages  manage the use of non web internet traffic  such as peer to peer communications and instant messaging  control misuse of an organization s valuable computing resources  including unauthorized downloading of high bandwidth content 
since we commenced operations in  websense has evolved from a reseller of computer security products to a leading developer and provider of it security software solutions 
our first web filtering software product was released in and prevented access to inappropriate web content 
since then  we have focused on adapting our web filtering and content classification capabilities to address changing internet use patterns including the rise of web based social and business applications and the growing incidence of web based criminal activity 
during both and  we derived of our revenue from international sales  and during  with the united kingdom comprising approximately  and of the revenue during  and  respectively 
we believe international markets continue to represent a significant growth opportunity and we are continuing to expand our international operations  particularly in selected countries in the european  asia pacific and latin american markets 
we utilize a two tier distribution strategy in north america to sell our products  with an objective of increasing the number of value added resellers selling our products and further extending our reach into the smb market segment 
our distribution strategy outside north america also relies on a multi tiered system of distributors and value added resellers 
sales through indirect channels currently account for more than of our revenue 
sales to ingram micro  one of our broad line distributors for north america that sold our products through approximately  resellers in  accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
we also have several arrangements with oems that grant the oem customers the right to incorporate our products into the oem s products for resale to end users 
we sell subscriptions to our products  generally in  or month contract durations  based on the number of seats or devices managed 
as described elsewhere in this report  we recognize revenue from subscriptions to our software products on a daily straight line basis commencing on the day the term of the subscription begins  over the term of the subscription agreement 
we recognize revenue associated with oem contracts ratably over the contractual period for which we are obligated to provide our services 
we generally recognize the operating expenses related to these sales as they are incurred 
these operating expenses include sales commissions  which are based on the total amount of the subscription contract and are fully expensed in the period the product and or key are delivered 
our operating expenses in decreased as compared to primarily due to a reduction in the amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately million and to a lesser extent the overall favorable movement of currency exchange rates 
these cost reductions were partially offset in by increased cost of sales related to our appliances of approximately million and increased investments in product research and development 

table of contents in october  we closed our acquisition of surfcontrol and as a result incurred a net loss under gaap during the fourth quarter of and for fiscal years  and similar to websense  surfcontrol sold products primarily under subscriptions whereby revenues were recorded ratably over the term of the agreement 
under purchase accounting  we wrote off million of the deferred revenue of surfcontrol  leaving a balance of million 
this adjustment reflected the fair value of the post contract technical support services that is recognized daily in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
in connection with the acquisition  we incurred restructuring costs primarily in connection with reducing surfcontrol headcount and eliminating redundant facilities 
as of the acquisition date  we also immediately started to incur the expenses of operating the surfcontrol operations as well as recording the amortization of the acquired intangibles 
primarily as a result of our deferred revenue as of december   our new and renewed billings during and the significant reduction in the amortization charges of acquired intangible assets  we reported net income for fiscal and currently expect to report even higher net income for fiscal billings represent the amount of subscription contracts billed to customers during the period 
our subscription based business model operates such that billings are recorded initially to our balance sheet as deferred revenue and then recognized to our income statement as revenue ratably over the subscription term or  in the case of oem arrangements  over the contractual obligation period 
our billings are not a numerical measure that can be calculated in accordance with gaap 
we provide this measurement in reporting financial performance because this measurement provides a consistent basis for understanding our sales activities each period 
we believe the billings measurement is useful because the gaap measurements of revenue and deferred revenue in the current period include subscription contracts commenced in prior periods 
we reported billings net of distributor marketing payments  channel rebates and adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts of million during compared to million during billings from renewals of existing subscriptions declined from million in to million in and billings from oem arrangements declined from million in to million in billings from incremental sales including subscriptions to new customers and upgraded subscriptions increased from million in to million in we expect these trends to continue in during the fourth quarter of  the momentum and mix of our business shifted to our triton based web security gateway family 
the average annual value of each subscription sold during was  compared to  in  reflecting our increased sale of web security and web security gateway products to larger enterprise customers 
we expect our billings to grow in relative to billings 
our billings depend in part on the number of subscriptions up for renewal each quarter and are influenced by seasonal variations with our fourth quarter generally being the strongest quarter in billings  and our first quarter generally being the lowest quarter for billings each fiscal year 
as a trend  the percentage of billings from subscriptions to our web security gateway products  including those pre installed on appliances is increasing and the percentage of billings from our pure web filtering products is declining 
during  we completed a global restructuring of our internal distribution operations 
the restructuring became effective in  and we anticipate that it will reduce the complexity and compliance risks associated with our global distribution activities 
it may also result in a reduction in our gaap effective tax rate depending on our results of operations  including our international revenue relative to our us revenue 
we are required to implement new revenue recognition rules in under which revenue for sales of appliances and the related costs will generally be recognized when the appliances are sold 
in general  this means we will no longer amortize the revenue and costs for appliance sales booked in over the software subscription period 
adoption of the new rules will not change recognition of subscription software revenue or how billings are reported 
these new rules are not being adopted retroactively and approximately million in deferred revenue and approximately million in deferred costs as of december  associated with past appliance sales will be recognized ratably over the remaining subscription term 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that may have a material impact on our financial statements and also require management to exercise significant judgment due to a high degree of uncertainty at the time the estimate is made 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies  related accounting estimates and disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
when a purchase decision is made  customers can order any number of products from websense and enter into a subscription agreement  which is generally  or months in duration and is for a fixed number of seats or devices 
these products include on premise software subscriptions  saas subscriptions  premium post contract technical support and appliances 
additionally  websense on premise and saas subscriptions include updates upgrades and standard post contract technical support over the subscription term 
under software revenue recognition accounting guidance  vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price is required in order to separate multiple elements in an arrangement including software 
as websense does not have adequate support for vsoe  all elements in a multiple element arrangement containing software are treated as a single unit of accounting 
we recognize revenue for the entire arrangement as a single unit of accounting on a daily straight line basis  commencing on the date the term of the subscription begins  and continuing over the term of the subscription agreement  provided the fee is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured 
upon entering into a subscription arrangement for a fixed or determinable fee  we electronically deliver access codes to users  and in the case of our appliance product we ship the product with our software pre installed on the product  and then promptly invoice customers for the full amount of their order 
payment is due for the full term of the subscription  generally within to days of the invoice 
we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
we are required to implement new revenue recognition rules beginning january  under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements  tangible products eg  appliances that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance  and software enabled products will be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance 
additionally  when vsoe or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance requires significant management judgment when determining its best estimate of selling price eg  the selection of relevant market conditions and entity specific factors 
upon adoption of these rules  we will generally recognize revenue for sales of appliances and the related costs when sold 
the adoption of these standards will not change the recognition of deferred revenue and deferred costs on our balance sheet as of december  when we enter into a subscription agreement that is denominated and paid in a currency other than us dollars  we record the subscription billing and deferred revenue in us dollars based upon the currency exchange rate in effect on the last day of the previous month before the subscription agreement is effective 
changes in currency rates relative to the us dollar may have a significant impact on the revenue that we will recognize under contracts that are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
to the extent we sell appliances to customers who have already purchased appliance products with pre installed software  we may recognize the entire revenue for the sale of the additional equipment not tied to a subscription upon shipment 
for our oem contracts  we grant our oem customers the right to incorporate our products into their products for resale to end users 
the oem customer generally pays us a royalty fee for each resale of our product to an end user over a specified period of time 
we recognize revenue associated with the oem contracts ratably over the contractual period for which we are obligated to provide our services 
the timing of the oem revenue recognition will vary for each oem depending on the information available  such as underlying end user 
table of contents subscription periods  to determine the contractual obligation period 
to the extent we provide any custom software and engineering services in connection with an oem arrangement we defer recognition of all revenue until acceptance of the custom software 
we record distributor marketing payments and channel rebates as an offset to revenue 
we recognize distributor marketing payments as an offset to revenue as the marketing service is provided 
we recognize channel rebates as an offset to revenue generally on a straight line basis over the term of the underlying subscription sale 
acquisitions  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with gaap accounting rules for business combinations which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the fair value of intangible assets  including acquired technology and customer relationships  is based on significant judgments made by management 
the valuations and useful life assumptions are based on information available near the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that are considered reasonable by management 
in our assessment of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in the portauthority and surfcontrol acquisitions  management used valuation techniques and made various assumptions 
our analysis and financial projections were based on management s prospective operating plans and the historical performance of the acquired businesses 
we engaged third party valuation firms to assist management in the following developing an understanding of the economic and competitive environment for the industry in which we and the acquired companies participate  identifying the intangible assets acquired  reviewing the acquisition agreements and other relevant documents made available  interviewing our employees  including the employees of the acquired companies  regarding the history and nature of the acquisition  historical and expected financial performance  product lifecycles and roadmap  and other factors deemed relevant to the valuation  performing additional market research and analysis deemed relevant to the valuation analysis  estimating the fair values and recommending useful lives of the acquired intangible assets  and preparing a narrative report detailing methods and assumptions used in the valuation of the intangible assets 
all work performed by the outside valuation firms was discussed and reviewed in detail by management to determine the estimated fair values of the intangible assets 
the judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact our results of operations 
we review goodwill that has an indefinite useful life for impairment at least annually in our fourth fiscal quarter  or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment 
to date  our reporting unit has not been at risk of failing the impairment test 
we amortize the cost of identified intangible assets using amortization methods that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up 
we review intangible assets that have finite useful lives when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment 
we review for impairment by facts or circumstances  either external or internal  indicating that we may not recover the carrying value of the asset 
we measure impairment losses related to long lived assets based on the amount by which the carrying amounts of these assets exceed their fair values 
we measure fair value generally based on the estimated future cash flows 
our analysis is based on available information and on assumptions and projections that we consider to be reasonable and supportable 
if necessary  we perform subsequent calculations to measure the amount of the impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the impaired assets 

table of contents share based compensation 
we account for share based compensation under the fair value method 
share based compensation expense related to stock options and employee stock purchase plan share grants is recorded based on the fair value of the award on its grant date 
we estimate the fair value using the black scholes valuation model 
share based compensation expense related to restricted stock unit awards is calculated based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
at december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans excluding tax effects 
that total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for estimated forfeitures as well as for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of approximately years 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions described below 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on the history of grants and exercises in our option database 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on both the historical volatility as well as the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock 
we base the risk free interest rate that is used in the black scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
we amortize the fair value ratably over the vesting period of the awards  which is typically four years 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future or select a different option valuation model altogether  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share in the future 
we determine the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model that is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our historical stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  in management s opinion the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
these reserves for tax contingencies are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with prevailing law and practice 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of tax audits 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 
deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction  the carry forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  and other relevant factors 

table of contents we use a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
during the first quarter of  we were informed by the irs that they had completed their audit for the tax years ended december  through december  accordingly  the irs issued us a day letter which outlined all of their proposed audit adjustments and required us to either accept the proposed adjustments  subject to future litigation  or file a formal administrative protest contesting those proposed adjustments within days 
the proposed adjustments relate primarily to the cost sharing arrangement between websense  inc and our irish subsidiary  including the amount of cost sharing buy in  as well as to our claim of research and development tax credits and income tax deductions for equity compensation awarded to certain executive officers 
the amount of additional tax proposed by the irs totals approximately million  of which million relates to the amount of cost sharing buy in  million relates to research and development credits and million relates to equity compensation awarded to certain executive officers 
the total additional tax proposed excludes interest  penalties and state income taxes  each of which may be significant  and also excludes a potential reduction in tax on the irish subsidiary 
the proposed adjustments also do not include the future impact that changes in our cost sharing arrangement could have on our effective tax rate 
we disagree with all of the proposed adjustments and have submitted a formal protest to the irs for each matter 
the irs has acknowledged the receipt of our protest and has assigned our case to an irs appeals officer 
we are now awaiting an appointment with the assigned appeals officer 
we intend to continue to defend our position on all of these matters  including through litigation if required 
the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
allowance for doubtful accounts and other loss contingencies 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to pay their invoices 
we establish this allowance using estimates that we make based on factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  changes to customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and other facts and circumstances of our existing customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
other loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires significant judgment by management based on the facts and circumstances of each matter 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of revenues for each of the periods shown

our revenue is impacted by the duration of contracts for renewal and new subscriptions  the timing of sales of renewal and new subscriptions  subscription renewal rates  the average annual contract value and per seat price  and the effect of currency exchange rates on new and renewal subscriptions and subscription renewal rates in international markets 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of the costs of web content review  amortization of acquired technology  amortization of deferred costs associated with the sale of our appliance products  technical support and infrastructure costs associated with maintaining our databases and costs associated with providing our hosted security services 
cost of revenues increased to million in from million in the million increase was primarily due to increased cost of sales related to our websense appliances of million  increased personnel costs of million and increased allocated costs of million offset by decreased amortization of acquired technology of million 
amortization of acquired technology was million in 
table of contents compared to million in the decrease of million in amortization of acquired technology was primarily due to certain acquired technology being fully amortized in as of december   the acquired technology is being amortized over a remaining weighted average period of years 
based on the existing acquired technology intangible assets as of december  we expect to record approximately million of amortization of acquired technology during our full time employee headcount in cost of revenue departments increased from an average of employees during to an average of employees during  and is expected to remain relatively flat in we allocate the costs for human resources  employee benefits  payroll taxes  information technology  facilities and fixed asset depreciation to each of our functional areas based on headcount data 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenues was for both and we expect that cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollars in and as a percentage of revenue will increase slightly for compared to as described above in the revenues section  our cost of revenues will be impacted in by the new revenue recognition rules for sales of appliances under which the related costs will generally be recognized when the appliances are sold 
gross profit gross profit increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased revenue as described in the preceding revenues section 
as a percentage of revenue  gross profit was for both and we expect that gross profit as a percentage of revenue will remain in excess of of revenue for operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  personnel benefits  costs related to public relations  advertising  promotions and travel  amortization of acquired customer relationships as well as allocated costs 
selling and marketing expenses do not include payments to channel partners for marketing services and rebates as those are recorded as an offset to revenue 
selling and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to an million reduction in amortization of acquired customer relationships from the acquisition of surfcontrol in october and a million decrease in allocated costs  offset by increased personnel costs of million resulting from some executive level changes in the sales area during as of december   the acquired customer relationships intangible assets are being amortized over a remaining weighted average period of approximately years 
based on our existing acquired intangible assets as of december   we expect amortization of selling and marketing related acquired intangibles of million in  which is a decrease of approximately million compared to our headcount in sales and marketing decreased slightly from an average of during to an average of during headcount is expected to increase slightly in we expect overall selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our selling and marketing activities but decrease as a percentage of revenue in primarily due to the expected increase in revenue 
fluctuations in foreign currencies may also impact our expenses in  and the amount of sales commissions recognized during the year can vary based on the sales volume for our product subscriptions 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software developers and allocated costs 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase of million in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased personnel costs of million offset by a reduction in allocated costs of million 
although our headcount increased in research and development from an average of during to an average of during  the impact of the higher headcount was partially mitigated by the favorable movement in currency exchange rates in compared to and the majority of our increased number of employees were in relatively low cost foreign locations 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we increase our research and development efforts  continue to expand our base of product offerings and incur the full year impact of hiring of personnel to support our existing and new products 

table of contents as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses are expected to decline due to the expected increase in revenues 
fluctuations in foreign currencies may also impact our expenses in we are managing the increase in our absolute research and development expenses by operating research and development facilities in multiple international locations  including a facility in beijing  china  that have lower costs than our operations in the united states 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related expenses for our executive  finance  and administrative personnel  third party professional services fees and allocated costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the million decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a reduction in personnel costs and allocated costs 
our headcount decreased in general and administrative departments from an average of during to an average of during we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as a result of expected higher personnel costs  but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue in due to the expected increase in revenue 
interest expense interest expense primarily represents the interest incurred on the outstanding loans under the credit agreement and credit agreement 
interest expense decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to a lower average outstanding loan balance under the respective credit agreement and credit agreement  of million during compared to an average loan balance of million during and lower interest rates due to the reduction in the notional amount of principal subject to an unfavorable fixed rate swap agreement that expired in september also included in the interest expense is amortization of deferred financing fees of million and million for and  respectively  that were capitalized as part of the respective credit agreement and credit agreement 
during october we used the initial proceeds from our credit agreement to repay the term loan and retire the credit agreement 
in connection with the pay off of the term loan we wrote off approximately million of unamortized deferred financing costs 
we made principal payments on the debt outstanding under the respective credit agreement and credit agreement that reduced the outstanding balance from million as of december  to million as of december  as a result of more favorable terms in our credit agreement  our weighted average interest rate decreased from at december  to as of december  the amount of interest expense will fluctuate due to changes in the outstanding principal balance  changes in libor and changes in our applicable spread to libor based upon improvements in our consolidated leverage ratio in accordance with our credit agreement 
we expect interest expense to decline in compared to due to the lower interest rate on the credit facility 
fluctuations in libor could impact our marginal interest rate 
see liquidity and capital resources for a description of the credit agreement 
other expense income  net other expense income  net went from a net other income of million in to a net other expense of million in the change was due primarily to foreign exchange related net losses of million in compared to net gains of million in due to movements in the currency exchange rates during and we expect our net other expense income in will be consistent with or less than levels 
provision for income taxes in  we recognized an income tax provision of million compared to an income tax provision of million for the annual effective income tax rate for was compared to for the effective tax rate variance from the statutory rate primarily relates to earnings recognized in lower tax jurisdictions  and the reduction of a valuation allowance related to net operating losses for one of our subsidiaries in the united kingdom  partially offset by the write down of a deferred tax asset relating to the net operating 
table of contents losses in the united kingdom 
the effective tax rate variance from the statutory rate was primarily related to an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions and an increase in valuation allowance related to net operating losses for one of our subsidiaries in the united kingdom  partially offset by income generated in low tax jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate may change in future periods due to the composition of taxable income between domestic and international operations  any future acquisitions and any future changes or interpretations in tax rules and legislation  or corresponding accounting rules 
during  we completed a global restructuring of our internal distribution operations 
the restructuring became effective in  and we anticipate that it will reduce the complexity and compliance risks associated with our global distribution activities 
it may also result in a reduction in our effective tax rate depending on our results of operations  including our international revenue relative to our us revenue 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues revenues increased to million in from million in the increase was a result primarily of increased revenue from new  renewed and upgraded product subscriptions including saas security products  dlp products and oem contract revenue from to as well as the revenue from our websense web security gateway and v appliance sales that commenced in revenue from products sold in the united states accounted for million or of revenue compared to million or in revenue from products sold internationally accounted for million or of revenue compared to million or in cost of revenues cost of revenue increased to million in from million in the million increase primarily consisted of million of increased amortization of acquired technology primarily due to the acquisitions of technology in the latter part of  million related to increased personnel costs and million related to sales of our appliance products  offset by a reduction in our allocated costs of million

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue recognition that became effective for websense beginning january  under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements  tangible products eg  appliances that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance  and software enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance 
additionally  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
under the guidance  when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
prior to the adoption of these standards  we have been amortizing appliance revenue and costs over the software subscription period 
upon adoption of these standards  we will recognize revenue for sales of appliances and the related costs when sold and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
the adoption of these standards will not change the recognition of deferred revenue and deferred costs on our balance sheet as of december  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and retained earnings of million 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and retained earnings of million as restated 
during  we used our cash to pay down a net million of principal on our secured loan and an additional approximately million to repurchase our common stock 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared with million in the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily a result of decreased cash collections from our customers due to lower billings in compared to our operating cash flow is significantly influenced by sales of new and renewal subscriptions  accounts receivable collections and cash operating expenses 
a decrease in sales of subscriptions or accounts receivable collections will negatively impact our operating cash flow 
we expect to continue to generate significant cash flow from operations in net cash used in investing activities was million in compared with million in the million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of a million reduction in the purchase of property and equipment primarily due to the completion of the build out of our facilities in ireland and china during  offset by a million change in restricted cash 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared with million in the million increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in stock repurchases of million and tax payments related to restricted stock unit issuances of million  offset by a decrease in net principal payments on the secured loan of million in compared to and increased proceeds from exercises of stock options and issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan of million 
during the first quarter of  the irs issued us a day letter which outlined proposed audit adjustments that would result in an additional amount of tax totaling approximately million 
the proposed adjustments relate primarily to the cost sharing arrangement between us and our irish subsidiary  including the amount of cost sharing buy in  as well as to our claim of research and development tax credits and income tax deductions for equity compensation awarded to certain executive officers 
the total additional tax proposed excludes interest  penalties and state income taxes  each of which may be significant  and also excludes a potential reduction in tax on the irish subsidiary 
the proposed adjustments also do not include the future impact that changes in our cost 
table of contents sharing arrangement could have on our effective tax rate 
we disagree with all of the proposed adjustments and have submitted a formal protest to the irs for each matter  however  if these matters are not resolved in our favor  the additional tax payments would decrease the amount of cash available to us 
capital resources 
in october  we entered into our credit agreement and used the entire initial proceeds of million to repay the term loan and retire the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a secured revolving credit facility that matures on october  with an initial maximum aggregate commitment of million  including a million sublimit for issuances of letters of credit and million sublimit for swing line loans 
we may increase the maximum aggregate commitment under the credit agreement up to million if certain conditions are satisfied  including that we are not in default under the credit agreement at the time of the increase and that we obtain the commitment of the lenders participating in the increase 
loans under the credit agreement are designated at our election as either base rate or eurodollar rate loans 
base rate loans bear interest at a rate equal to the highest of i the federal funds rate plus  ii the eurodollar rate plus and iii bank of america s prime rate  in each case plus a margin set forth below 
eurodollar rate loans bear interest at a rate equal to i the eurodollar rate plus ii a margin set forth below 
the applicable margins until the date that we filed this annual report on form k were for base rate loans and for eurodollar rate loans 
thereafter the applicable margins are determined by reference to our leverage ratio  as set forth in the table below consolidated leverage ratio eurodollar rate loans base rate loans for each commercial letter of credit  we must pay a fee equal to per annum times the daily amount available to be drawn under such letter of credit and  for each standby letter of credit  we must pay a fee equal to the applicable margin for eurodollar rate loans times the daily amount available to be drawn under such letter of credit 
a quarterly commitment fee is payable to the lenders in an amount equal to the unused portion of the credit facility multiplied by indebtedness under the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets  including pledges of stock of certain of our subsidiaries subject to limitations in the case of foreign subsidiaries and by secured guarantees by our domestic subsidiaries 
the credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants  including an obligation to maintain a certain consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated interest coverage ratio and restrictions on our ability to borrow money  to incur liens  to enter into mergers and acquisitions  to make dispositions  to pay cash dividends or repurchase capital stock  and to make investments  subject to certain exceptions 
for example  the credit agreement permits us to repurchase our securities so long as we are not in default under the credit agreement  have complied with all of our financial covenants  and have liquidity of at least million  provided  however  if  after giving effect to any repurchase  our leverage ratio is greater than  such repurchase cannot exceed million in the aggregate in any fiscal year 
the credit agreement does not require us to use excess cash to pay down debt 
the credit agreement provides for acceleration of our obligations thereunder upon certain events of default 
the events of default include  without limitation  failure to pay loan amounts when due  any material inaccuracy in our representations and warranties  failure to observe covenants  defaults on any other indebtedness  entering bankruptcy  existence of a judgment or decree against us or our subsidiaries involving an aggregate liability of million or more  the security interest or guarantee ceasing to be in full force and effect  any person becoming the beneficial owner of more than of our outstanding common stock  or our board of directors ceasing to consist of a majority of continuing directors 

table of contents obligations and commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands payment obligations by year thereafter total credit agreement scheduled principal payments estimated interest and fees operating leases other commitments total obligations under our credit agreement represent the future minimum principal debt payments due under the secured revolving credit facility 
estimated interest and fees expected to be incurred on the secured revolving credit facility are based on known rates and scheduled principal payments  as well as the interest rate swap agreement  as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we lease our facilities under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through over of our operating lease commitments are related to our corporate headquarters lease in san diego  which extends through december our corporate headquarters lease includes escalating rent payments from to the rent expense related to our worldwide office space leases are generally recorded monthly on a straight line basis in accordance with gaap 
other commitments represent minimum contractual commitments for inbound software licenses  equipment maintenance and automobile leases 
in addition  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements have been excluded from the contractual payment obligations table above 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
share repurchase program 
in  we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million shares of our common stock 
in  we announced that our board of directors increased the size of the stock repurchase program by an additional million shares  for a total program size of up to million shares 
in  we announced that our board of directors increased the size of the stock repurchase program by an additional million shares  for a total program size of up to million shares 
in january  our board of directors increased the size of the stock repurchase program by an additional million shares  for a total program size of up to million shares 
in october  our board of directors increased the number of shares authorized for repurchase under the program by million shares  for a total program size of up to million shares 
repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices 
in january  we adopted a b plan that provides for quarterly purchases of our common stock in open market transactions 
in november  our board of directors increased the value of shares to be repurchased under our existing b plan to million per quarter  or million in aggregate for depending on market conditions and other factors  purchases by our agent under this program may be 
table of contents commenced or suspended at any time  or from time to time  without prior notice to us 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate of approximately million at an average price of per share through both our b repurchase plan and through open market purchases 
as of december   we had cumulatively repurchased  shares of our common stock under this program for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share 
our credit agreement permits us to repurchase our securities so long as we are not in default under the credit agreement  have complied with all of our financial covenants  and have liquidity of at least million  provided  however  if  after giving effect to any repurchase  our leverage ratio is greater than  such repurchase cannot exceed million in the aggregate in any fiscal year 
we intend to continue repurchasing shares during prospective capital needs 
despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets  to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs 
future volatility in the capital markets  however  may increase costs associated with debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balances  accounts receivable and cash generated by operations  together with access to external sources of funds as described above  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next months 
our cash requirements may increase for reasons we do not currently foresee or we may make acquisitions as part of our growth strategy that increase our cash requirements 
we may elect to raise funds for these purposes or to reduce our cost of capital through capital markets transactions or debt or private equity transactions as appropriate 
we intend to continue to invest our cash in excess of current operating and capital requirements in interest bearing  investment grade money market funds 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash and cash equivalents and secured revolving credit facility 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments such as money market funds 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and the interest expense incurred on our secured loan and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our money market funds and from our borrowings under our variable rate credit facility 
in connection with our credit agreement we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to pay a fixed rate of interest per annum and receive a floating rate interest payment based on three month libor on a principal amount of million 
the million swap agreement becomes effective on december  and expires on october  a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would materially affect our interest expense 
however  the impact of this type of adverse movement would be partially mitigated by our interest rate swap agreement that becomes effective on december  based on our revolving credit balance at december   our interest expense would increase on a pre tax basis by approximately  during if there were a basis point adverse move in the interest rate yield curve 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive investments at december  changes in interest rates over time will  however  affect our interest income 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we sell our products through a distribution network in over countries  and we bill certain international customers in euros  british pounds  australian dollars and chinese renminbi 
additionally  a significant portion of our foreign subsidiaries operating expenses are incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we sell our products 
to mitigate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates  we utilize foreign currency forward contracts and zero cost collar contracts to hedge foreign currency market exposures of underlying assets  liabilities and expenses 
we also keep working funds necessary to facilitate the short term operations of our subsidiaries in the local currencies in which they do business 
as exchange rate fluctuations can significantly vary our sales and expense results when converted to us dollars  our objective is to reduce the risk to earnings and cash flows associated with changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
notional and fair values of our hedging positions at december  and are presented in the table below in thousands december  december  notional value local currency notional value usd fair value usd notional value local currency notional value usd fair value usd fair value hedges euro british pound australian dollar total 
table of contents the approximate million notional decrease in our euro hedged position at december  compared to december  is primarily a result of the timing differences between when assets were acquired and or liabilities incurred 
all of the euro hedging contracts in place on december  will be settled before april for and  less than of our total billings were denominated in the euro 
we do not expect euro billings to represent more than of our total billings during the approximate million notional increase in our british pound hedged position at december  compared to december  is primarily the result of the timing differences between when assets were acquired and or liabilities incurred 
all of the british pound hedging contracts in place as of december  will be settled before march for and  less than of our total billings were denominated in the british pound 
we do not expect british pound billings to represent more than of our total billings during the approximate million notional decrease in our australian dollar hedged position at december  compared to december  is primarily the result of the timing differences between when assets were acquired and or liabilities incurred 
there were no outstanding australian dollar hedging contracts as of december  for and  less than of our total billings were denominated in the australian dollar 
we expect australian dollar billings to represent less than of our total billings during a significant portion of our foreign subsidiaries operating expenses are incurred in foreign currencies so if the us dollar weakens  our consolidated operating expenses would increase 
should the us dollar strengthen  our products may become more expensive for our international customers with subscription contracts denominated in us dollars  especially if the trend continues of international sales growing as a percentage of our total sales 
changes in currency rates also impact our future revenue under subscription contracts that are not denominated in us dollars 
our revenue and deferred revenue for these foreign currencies are recorded in us dollars when the subscription is entered into based upon currency exchange rates in effect on the last day of the previous month before the subscription agreement is entered into 
we engage in currency hedging activities with the intent of limiting the risk of exchange rate fluctuations  but our foreign exchange hedging activities also involve inherent risks that could result in an unforeseen loss
