financial operations overview revenues rental revenues of asr owned properties 
we derive our rental revenues from our tenants that occupy space in our portfolio of owned properties 
there are three key drivers to our rental revenue  occupancy in asr owned properties our rental revenues are dependent on our ability to lease the spaces we own to quality tenants 
our initiatives to reduce vacancy in our owned properties have resulted in about the same weighted average occupancy rates in as compared to

table of contents rental rates related to asr owned properties market rental rates are often inversely related to vacancy rates 
increased vacancy in the market place tends to drive down rental rates 
our leases typically have one to ten year terms based on property type 
as leases expire  we replace the existing leases with new leases at the current market rental rate

weighted average base rent per occupied square foot as of december  property type office properties industrial properties retail property self storage property n a tenant retention in asr owned properties retaining existing tenants is essential  as high customer retention leads to increased occupancy  less downtime between leases  and reduced leasing costs 
we believe in providing superior customer service  hiring  training  retaining and empowering our employees 
we strive to create an environment of open communication both internally and externally with our customers 
third party management and leasing revenue 
we derive these revenues from the fees charged to our third party clients for such management services  tenant acquisition fees  leasing fees and loan advisory fees for arranging financing related to properties under management 
when and if our third party client elects to sell the property we manage for them  we will receive transaction fees and commissions relating to the sale of the property 
our same core skill set that influences our rental income also drives our third party client revenue 
many of the fees we charge our third party clients are linked to occupancy  rental rates and customer retention 
expenses property operating expenses 
property operating expenses consist primarily of property taxes  insurance  repairs and maintenance  personnel costs and building service contracts 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses for accounting  human resources  information technology and corporate administration  professional fees including audit and investor relations 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses consist primarily of depreciation associated with our real estate held for investment  depreciation of additional capital improvements and the amortization of lease costs associated with owned properties 
interest expenses 
interest expenses consist primarily of the interest we owe to our creditors for debt associated with our owned properties 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our belief of what could occur in the future considering available information  including assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our most significant estimates  judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements variable interest entity accounting  business combinations  investment in real estate assets  purchase price allocation of real estate acquired  discontinued operations  sales of real estate assets  fair value measurements  impairment of assets  and income taxes 
variable interest entity accounting we have many relationships with many different types of entities  some of those entities are variable interest entities vies 
we consolidate any vie for which we are the primary beneficiary 
in accordance with the requirements of the consolidation topic  we analyze our variable interests  including equity investments  guarantees  management agreements and advances  to determine if an entity in which we have a variable interest is a vie 
our analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative reviews 
we base our quantitative analysis on the estimated future cash flows of the entity  and our qualitative analysis on the design of the entity  its organizational structure including decision making ability and relevant financial agreements 
all of these factors are highly subjective and require significant judgment on the part of management 
business combinations the company applies the provisions of fasb asc topic to all transactions or events in which an entity obtains control of one or more businesses  including those effected without the transfer of consideration  for example  by contract or through a lapse of minority veto rights 
these provisions require the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction whether a full or partial acquisition  establish the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and require expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs 
the company determines whether acquisitions should be accounted for as a business combination 
this policy applies to all transactions or events in which an entity obtains control of one or more businesses  including those effected without the transfer of consideration  for example  by contract or through a lapse of minority veto rights 
the company determines and allocates the purchase price of an acquired company to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the business combination date 
the purchase price allocation process requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions  including fair value estimates  as of the business combination date 
we utilize third party valuation companies to help us determine certain fair value estimates used for assets and liabilities 
additionally  the purchase price of the applicable property is allocated to the above or below market value of in place leases and the value of in place leases and related tenant relationships 
the value allocable to the above or below market component of the acquired in place leases is determined based upon the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term  and ii our estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the amounts allocated to below market lease values are included in accrued and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to rental income over the remaining non cancelable lease term plus any below market renewal options of the acquired leases with each property 

table of contents while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business combination date  our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the purchase price allocation period  which is generally one year from the business combination date  we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
investment in real estate assets rental properties are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  unless circumstances indicate that cost  net of accumulated depreciation  cannot be recovered 
depreciation is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
the useful lives are as follows

building and improvements to years tenant improvements term of the related lease furniture and equipment to years discontinued operations the company classifies assets as held for sale when management a approves the action and commits to a plan to sell the asset s  b the asset s are available for immediate sale in its present condition customary for sales of those types of assets  c an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset s have been initiated  d the sale of the asset s is probable  and transfer of the asset s is expected to within one year  e the asset s is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and  f actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn 
at the time a property is held for sale  the property is carried at the lower of i its carrying amount or ii fair value less costs to sell 
in addition  no depreciation or amortization of tenant origination cost is recorded for a property classified as held for sale 
the company classifies operating properties as properties held for sale in the period in which all of the required criteria are met 
the company reports  for both current and prior periods  the assets  liabilities and results of operations of any component of the company which has either been disposed of  or is classified as held for sale  as discontinued operations 
in instances when a company expects to have significant continuing involvement in the component beyond the date of sale  the operations of the component instead continue to be fully recorded within the continuing operations of our books through the date of sale 
the company records any results of operations related to our real estate held for sale as discontinued operations only when we expect not to have significant continuing involvement in the real estate after the date of sale 
sales of real estate assets gains on property sales are recognized in full when real estate is sold  provided i the gain is determinable  that is  the collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured or the amount that will not be collectible can be estimated  and ii the earnings process is virtually complete  that is  the company is not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the gain 
losses on property sales are recognized immediately 
fair value measurements fair value measurements are determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
a fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels and of the hierarchy and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level of the hierarchy 
level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability 
table of contents other than quoted prices  such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  which is typically based on an entity s own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
impairment of assets rental properties and intangibles are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate it is probable that the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount 
impairment indicators for our rental properties are assessed by project and include  but is not limited to  significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income  occupancy changes  rental rates and other market factors 
the company assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors  including  but not limited to  appropriate capitalization rates  available market information  historical operating results  known trends and market economic conditions that may affect the property and our assumptions about the use of the asset  including  if necessary  a probability weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration 
upon determination that impairment has occurred and that the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount  a write down will be recorded to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting 
we have assessed  using all available positive and negative evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists i the more positive evidence is necessary and ii the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion  or all  of the deferred tax asset 
among the more significant types of evidence that we considered are that future anticipated property sales will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset  taxable income projections in future years  and whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits 
we have incurred taxable losses for each of the two years ended december  and historically  we have incurred taxable losses in years in which we do not sell any real estate assets for gains 
a property was sold during and a profit of million was realized on that sale 
we expect to sell real estate assets in the future and have determined that it is more likely than not that future taxable income  primarily from gains on the sales of real estate assets  will be sufficient to enable us to realize all of our deferred tax assets 
therefore  for each of the two years ended december  and  no valuation allowance has been recorded
