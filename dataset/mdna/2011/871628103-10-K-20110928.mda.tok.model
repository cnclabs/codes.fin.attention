item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the risk factors section of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
business overview we are a global energy and gasification technology company that provides products and solutions to the energy and chemical industries 
our strategy is to create value through providing technology and equipment in regions where low rank coals and biomass feedstocks can be profitably converted into high value products through our proprietary u gas fluidized bed gasification technology 
we do this through providing a proprietary technology package whereby we license u gas technology rights to third parties  deliver an engineered technology package and provide proprietary equipment components to customers who have contracted to own and operate projects 
in addition  we may i integrate our u gas technology package with downstream technologies to provide a fully integrated offering where we may invest in projects either directly or through an investment partner  ii partner with engineering  equipment and technology companies to provide our u gas technology package into an integrated modular product offering  iii provide technology to enable coal resources to be integrated together with our u gas technology where the coal resources may be of little value without our u gas conversion technology  or iv acquire or partner with owners of these coal resources to create more value and opportunity for us through the integration of our technology with the coal resources 
we believe that we have several advantages over commercially available competing gasification technologies  such as entrained flow  fixed and moving bed gasification technologies  including our ability to use all ranks of coals including low rank  high ash and high moisture coals  which are significantly cheaper than higher grade coals  many coal waste products and biomass feed stocks 
in addition  u gas technology s advanced fluidized bed design is tolerant to changes in feedstock 
these factors enable us to be a lower cost producer of synthesis gas  or syngas  a mixture of primarily hydrogen and carbon monoxide  which can then be used to produce other products 
depending on local market need and fuel sources  syngas can be used as a fuel gas in industrial applications or can be used to produce many products including power  synthetic natural gas  or sng  methanol  dimethyl ether  or dme  glycol  ammonia  direct reduction iron  or dri  synthetic gasoline  steam  and other byproducts eg  sulphur  carbon dioxide or ash 
our principal operating activities are currently in china  however  we are developing opportunities in other countries including india  the us and australia  as well as other parts of asia and europe 
our zz joint venture project is our first commercial scale coal gasification plant and is located in shandong province  china 
it has been in operation since february and in commercial operation since december our yima project is currently under construction in henan province  china 
the key elements of our business strategy include executing on existing projects in china 
we are continuing to implement operational measures to improve the financial performance of our zz joint venture plant in the near term  while also continuing to evaluate alternatives to better position the project to be commercially and financially successful in the future  including the possible expansion of the plant to produce other products for other customers 
we also intend to continue to leverage our success to date at the zz joint venture in our ongoing business development efforts  including through further visits from senior executives of possible customers and partners  as well as government officials  from china  india  australia  vietnam  and southern africa 
we are also continuing the ongoing construction of our yima project  and are working to restructure our joint venture agreements to change the scope of the project from methanol to glycol production 
leveraging our proprietary technology through licensing  equipment sales and related services to increase revenues and position us for future growth 
we provide a proprietary technology package whereby we license u gas technology rights to third parties  deliver an engineered technology package and provide proprietary equipment components to customers who have contracted to own and operate projects 
we intend to focus on developing opportunities for our proprietary technology package whereby we may i integrate our u gas technology package with downstream technologies to provide a fully integrated offering where we may invest in projects either directly or through an investment partner or ii may partner with engineering  equipment and technology companies to provide our u gas technology package into an integrated modular product offering  which may include coal or biomass feedstocks for units producing power and fuels such as sng  methanol to gasoline  or mtg  diesel and ethanol as well as methanol for gasoline blending 
we anticipate that we can increase revenues through collecting technology licensing fees and royalties  engineering and technical service fees  as well as equipment product sales sold to customers who have contracted to own and operate projects and desire to incorporate our proprietary technology 
we also believe that our licensing activities will provide additional insight into project development activities  which may allow us to make selective equity investments in such projects in the future  develop integrated  modular product offerings  or take options in projects for which we provide a license 

table of contents expanding our relationships with strong strategic partners 
our efforts have been initially focused on facilities producing syngas  methanol and dme in china 
we are expanding our relationships with our current partners and developing new relationships  including through our transaction with zjx and china energy and through strategic joint venture initiatives in specific markets that will enable us to expand our business 
such strategic relationships may include an investment in projects either directly by us or through an investment partner where u gas plants may supply syngas to strategic customers via long term offtake agreements 
for example  through our joint venture ses resource solutions  we are working with midas resource partners ag  a coal resource consulting and project development firm  to collaborate on project origination and project development activities for integrated coal resource gasification projects to incentivize third party investors to commit to providing financing for such projects 
we are also developing new downstream coal to chemicals and coal to energy projects which may expand our initial focus to include facilities producing sng  mtg  glycol  and power and reducing gas for the steel industry 
we are exploring new markets for entry such as india  australia  and other parts of asia and europe 
developing value where we have a competitive advantage and have access of rights to feedstock resources 
we believe that we have the greatest competitive advantage using our u gas technology in situations where there is a ready source of low rank  low cost coal  coal waste or biomass to utilize as a feedstock 
we are focusing our efforts in countries with large low rank coal resources such as india  china  australia and south africa 
we are working to develop transactions that include securing options to these feedstock resources 
for example  we are currently in discussions regarding development opportunities in inner mongolia  china where provincial authorities are willing to make available coal resources to the project owners  which adds protection from future coal cost increases  and can potentially lead to increased project revenue 
in these cases  we may provide technology to add value to coal resources which may be of little value without our u gas conversion technology  or may acquire or partner with owners of these resources to create more value and opportunity for us through the integration of our technology with the resources 
additionally  where strategic relationships and capital and or financing is available  we may acquire an interest in such resources  including existing facilities or coal mines  where we could create value with our u gas technology by securing direct access to feedstock 
continue to develop and improve u gas technology 
we are continually seeking to improve overall plant availability  plant efficiency rates and fuel handling capabilities our u gas gasification technology 
we are continuing to work with our prospective customers to determine the suitability of their low rank coals for our u gas technology through proprietary coal characterization testing as well as selective commercial scale testing in our zz joint venture plant 
additionally  we are growing our technology base through continued development of know how with our engineering and technical staff  growing and protecting our trade secrets as a result of patenting improvements tested at our zz joint venture plant  and improvements resulting from integration of our technology with downstream processes 
one example includes the development of our fms which we believe can maximize the utilization of low rank coal in our u gas based gasifiers  resulting in improved cost advantages 
we have filed several patent applications relating to our improvements to the u gas technology 
grow earnings through increased revenues and control of expenses 
we remain intently focused on control of our expenses while we grow revenues from our technology business 
we believe our strategy will allow us to grow near term revenues to position us for sustainable long term growth 
we intend to minimize project development expenses until we have assurances that acceptable financing is available to complete our projects 
until we have such assurances  our strategy will be to operate using current capital resources and leveraging the resources of our strategic relationship and or financing partners 
results of operations we are in our development stage and therefore have had limited operations 
we generated revenues of million for the year ended june  we have sustained net losses of approximately million from november   the date of our inception  to june  we have primarily financed our operations to date through private placements and two public offerings of our common stock 

table of contents year ended june  compared to the year ended june  revenue 
total revenue increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  product sales increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and were derived from the sale of syngas and byproducts produced at the zz joint venture plant to hai hua 
the increase in revenue was due to higher levels of syngas production during fiscal as compared to fiscal for the years ended june  and  the plant operated for and of the period  respectively  and the plant s availability for production was and of the period  respectively 
during the three months ended june   hai hua notified the zz joint venture plant that it will not continue payment of capacity fees beyond april for commercial and contractual reasons 
the unpaid amount totaled approximately  as of june  the plant has continued to operate and provide syngas to hai hua  and hai hua has paid other contractual obligations such as the energy fees and by product sales due under the contract 
we are working with hai hua to resolve payment of the capacity fees 
we did not recognize these capacity fee revenues during fiscal and we will not recognize any capacity fees until collection is reasonably assured 
technology licensing and related services revenues increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was due primarily to revenues generated from the recognition of previously deferred revenues received under a license agreement entered into in april which has since been terminated due to the licensee s inability to obtain financing for its project

the losses were comprised of non capitalizable costs incurred during the design and construction phase  offset in part  by interest income earned on invested funds contributed by us and yima 
the losses for the year ended june  increased due to higher personnel and land lease related costs as portions of the project are nearing completion 
foreign currency gain 
foreign currency gains increased million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the foreign currency gains have resulted from the appreciation of the renminbi yuan relative to the us dollar and are generated on us dollar denominated shareholder loans payable by our chinese operations 
interest income 
interest income increased million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to higher yields earned on cash equivalent investments 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for both of the years ended june  and our interest expense relates primarily to our long term debt comprised of the zz joint venture s outstanding principal balance on its loan with the industrial and commercial bank of china  or icbc 
in addition  the zz joint venture has incurred additional interest expense of approximately  during due to incurring discounting costs on bank notes received from its customer in settlement of the zz joint venture s accounts receivable 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million during the year ended june  net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended june  was principally from golden concord absorbing their interest in the asset impairment loss recognized by the gc joint venture 
year ended june  compares to the year ended june  revenue 
total revenue increased million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  product sales were million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and were derived primarily from the sale of syngas and other byproducts produced at the zz joint venture plant in china 
product revenues increased at the plant due to the plant s increased availability for production  increased syngas volume offtake by our customer  hai hua  and increased byproduct sales  including sales of our excess oxygen to hai hua under our asu cost sharing arrangement  which commenced in september for the year ended june   the zz joint venture plant operated for of the period and was available for production for of the period 
plant operations and syngas production was limited primarily due to extended shutdowns by hai hua 
although the syngas volume offtake by hai hua increased during fiscal compared to fiscal  to date  hai hua was unable to offtake the volume of syngas originally expected for the original plant design 
the zz joint venture plant was in its commissioning phase prior to achieving commercial operations status in december other related party revenue during the year ended june  of million was generated for engineering services provided to the yima joint ventures during the year ended june  there was no other related party revenue during the year ended june  technology licensing and related services revenues were million for the year ended june  and were generated from feasibility studies and other technical services provided in association with our technology licensing business 
there were no technology licensing and related services revenues during the year ended june  other revenues were million for the year ended june  and related to a sponsorship grant for lignite testing at the zz joint venture plant 
other revenues were million for the year ended june  and were generated by a feasibility study for a project in the us that has since been cancelled 
costs of sales and plant operating expenses 
costs of sales and plant operating expenses increased million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and were comprised principally of coal consumption  electricity  and other operating costs at the zz joint venture plant 
the increase is due to a significant increase in syngas production during the year ended june  a majority of the costs during the year ended june  were incurred prior to the plant achieving commercial operations status in december 
table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million to million during the year ended june  compared to million during the year ended june  the decrease of million was primarily due to a decrease in compensation costs as a result of reduced staffing levels  and a decrease in consulting and professional fees 
project and technical development expenses 
project and technical development expenses increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  project development expenses for the year ended june  included a million charge for a consulting fee related to the financial closing of the yima project

asset impairment losses 
an asset impairment loss of million during the year ended june  related to the write off of the long lived assets of the gc joint venture 
the period included a million impairment loss on a royalty deposit during the three months ended december  and a non cash charge to write off the million remaining carrying value of the reservation and use fee paid to gti 
stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the period included a credit of approximately million due to the reversal of previously recognized expense due to forfeitures related to cancellations of terminated employees stock option awards 
excluding the effect of this credit  stock based compensation expense decreased because the amount of stock based compensation expense associated with grants of stock option awards during and was lower than certain prior awards due to the decrease in the price of our common stock 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased by million to million during the year ended june  compared to million during the year ended june  the decrease was due principally to the change in the estimated useful live of the production equipment at the zz joint venture plant from a period of years to years effective october  and a reduction in equipment costs of million due to settlement with a construction vendor 
equity in losses of the yima joint ventures 
the equity in losses of the yima joint ventures for the year ended june  relates to our share of the loss incurred by the yima joint ventures 
the losses were comprised of non capitalizable costs incurred during the design and construction phase  offset in part  by interest income earned on invested funds contributed by us and yima 
there were no equity in losses of the yima joint venture during the year ended june  interest income 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to lower yields earned on cash equivalent investments and lower invested principal balances 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million during the year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to the zz joint venture s lower outstanding principal balance on its loan with icbc and to a lower interest rate based on the annual adjustment in march to 
this rate was not adjusted in net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million during the year ended june  the increase resulted principally from golden concord absorbing their interest in the asset impairment loss recognized by the gc joint venture 
liquidity and capital resources we are in our development stage and have financed our operations to date through private placements of our common stock in and and two public offerings  one in november and one in june we have used the proceeds of these offerings primarily for the development of and investments in our joint ventures in china and to pay other development and general and administrative expenses 
in addition  we have entered into a loan agreement with icbc to fund certain of the costs of the zz joint venture 
as of june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital available to us 
during the year ended june   we used million in operating activities compared to million for the year ended june  during fiscal  we had net cash provided from financing activities of million due to receiving million from the issuance of additional common stock to zuari and using approximately million for the scheduled semi annual principal payments on the zz joint venture s loan with icbc 

table of contents loan agreement on march   the zz joint venture entered into a seven year loan agreement and received million of loan proceeds pursuant to the terms of a fixed asset loan contract with icbc to complete the project financing for the zz joint venture 
key terms of the fixed asset loan contract with icbc are as follows term of the loan is seven years from the commencement date march  of the loan  interest is adjusted annually based upon the standard rate announced each year by the people s bank of china  and as of june   the applicable interest rate was and is payable monthly  principal payments of rmb million approximately million based on current currency exchange rates are due in march and september of each year beginning on september  and ending on march   hai hua is the guarantor of the entire loan  assets of the zz joint venture are pledged as collateral for the loan  covenants include  among other things  prohibiting pre payment without the consent of icbc and permitting icbc to be involved in the review and inspection of the zz joint venture plant  and subject to customary events of default which  should one or more of them occur and be continuing  would permit icbc to declare all amounts owing under the contract to be due and payable immediately 
as of june   the zz joint venture was in compliance with all covenants and obligations under the fixed asset loan contract 
share purchase agreement with zjx on march   we entered into a share purchase agreement  or the agreement  with china energy and zjx pursuant to which we will issue on the closing date to china energy  shares of our common stock  in exchange for approximately million  or the consideration 
within business days after the accomplishment of the milestone as defined below  we shall further issue directly to china energy an amount of shares of common stock which  when combined with the shares issued on the closing date  equals of the outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis 
in august  we agreed to extend the closing period of the agreement through december  the terms and conditions of the agreement are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
use of proceeds subject to the discretion and approval of the board  the consideration  net of costs and expenses  is required to be applied to the following i incorporation of a company headquarters in china to consolidate the ownership of our investment projects in china and enhance our presence in china  ii investing in the expansion of our zz joint venture  iii investing in phase i of our yima joint ventures  iv acquiring an ownership interest in a coal mine that will provide coal to the yima joint venture project  v investing in our golden concord joint venture  vi other chinese projects that may be recommended to the board from time to time  and vii other expenses of the operation and business of us in china 
zjx will use reasonable endeavours to assist us to obtain third party funding third party direct equity investment in projects or debt financing to the projects to a cover funding needs of the above projects  b provide funding for us to invest in future phases of the yima joint venture project  c invest in strategic coal resources in china connected to our projects  and d provide funding for us to invest in other projects in china not listed above and assist us to obtain third party investment in any of our other projects 

table of contents project development zjx will use reasonable endeavours to create at least four project joint ventures  or the mjvs  in the areas of synthetic natural gas  methanol to gasoline  fertilizer  and electric power 
funding for each mjv is expected to be approximately rmb billion 
each mjv is expected to be funded with equity from a strategic investor plus project debt 
we are anticipated to be part owner of each mjv through a targeted carry provided by the strategic investor as part of our development of and provision of technology for the particular projects 
zjx will help us work with the strategic investors to obtain long term purchase commitments for each of the mjvs prior to the start of construction of each such project 
closing of the transaction with china energy and zjx is subject to approval by our stockholders and other customary closing conditions 
other we have included the million payment paid to gti in june toward future royalties due to gti for the yima joint ventures project as part of our investment in the yima project 
an additional future royalty payment of approximately million will be due to gti upon the commissioning of the gasifier equipment for the yima project 
see note intangible assets for more information on the royalty payments 
outlook our strategy is to create value by providing technology and equipment in regions where low rank coals and biomass feedstocks can be profitably converted into high value products through our proprietary u gas fluidized bed gasification technology 
we do this by providing a proprietary technology package whereby we license u gas technology rights to third parties  deliver an engineered technology package and provide proprietary equipment components to customers who have contracted to own and operate projects 
we anticipate that we can generate revenues through engineering and technical service fees  as well as licensing fees and royalties on products sold by our licensees that incorporate our proprietary technology without incurring the significant capital costs required to develop a plant 
we also believe that our licensing activities will provide additional insight into project development activities  which may allow us to make selective equity investments in such projects in the future and afford opportunities to develop integrated  modular product offerings 
additionally  we are continuing to improve our technology in ways we believe will enhance our ability to further develop our licensing activities 
for example  in december  we successfully implemented our fines management system  or fms  which is a new technology for which we have filed a patent that relates to recovering energy remaining in the fines resulting from the gasification process 
using fms  we are now achieving over day continuous runs on each single gasifier  which allows us to achieve very high availability of syngas due to our spare stem gasifier configuration 
with fms  we believe we can maximize the utilization of low rank coal in our u gas based gasifiers  and as a result  improve the cost advantages derived from using our technology 
we currently plan to use our available cash for i our general and administrative expenses  ii debt service related to the zz joint venture  iii working capital  iv project and third party licensing and technical development expenses  v operating expenses of srs  and vi general corporate purposes 
the actual allocation and timing of these expenditures will be dependent on various factors  including changes in our strategic relationships  commodity prices and industry conditions  and other factors that we cannot currently predict 
in particular  any future decrease in economic activity in china or in other regions of the world in which we may in the future do business could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  markets for commodities such as methanol have been under significant recent pressure and we are unsure of how much longer methanol prices may remain depressed 
accordingly  our ability to finance and develop our existing projects  commence any new projects and sell products from our current operations could be adversely impacted 
we are pursuing possible u gas licensing opportunities with third parties allowing us to build on our experience at the zz joint venture and our overall technological and engineering capabilities 
we intend to place increased focus on development of licensing opportunities for our proprietary u gas technology on a global basis with a particular focus on india  china  australia and south africa due to large low rank coal resources present in these areas 
having access to such resources may lead to new commercial opportunities and greater cost and operating efficiencies in existing or planned projects 

table of contents we may i integrate our u gas technology package with downstream technologies to provide a fully integrated offering where we may invest in projects either directly or through an investment partner  ii partner with engineering  equipment and technology companies to provide our u gas technology package into an integrated modular product offering  iii provide technology to enable coal resources to be integrated together with our u gas technology where the coal resources may be of little commercial value without our u gas conversion technology  or iv acquire or partner with owners of these coal resources to create more value and opportunity for us through the integration of our technology with the coal resource 
we understand the need to partner in certain markets  and plan to do so with companies that we believe can help us accelerate our business 
our partnering approach in some cases is country specific and in some cases is industry or segment specific 
additionally  where capital and or financing is available  we may acquire an interest in such resources  including existing facilities or coal mines  where we could create value with our u gas technology through securing greater access to feedstock 
we believe our transaction with zjx and china energy when closed will further our business and strategic interests 
we believe the transaction will allow us to leverage zjx s existing relationships with major chinese companies  agencies  and institutions to raise additional capital and develop  permit  and construct additional projects  and to provide support to resolve any issues with our yima joint ventures and zz joint venture projects  as well as other projects in china we may become involved in 
if approved by our stockholders  the transaction will provide an immediate and substantial increase in our cash resources providing flexibility for our china business and the means to execute on portions of our business plan 
we believe that the strengthened balance sheet resulting from the transaction and the show of support by a significant investor and partner will have a positive impact on our technology licensing business and help facilitate new commercial opportunities 
additionally  zjx is prepared to assist us in securing long term offtake contracts with several of china s largest energy and commodity companies further enhancing our ability to finance our projects 
we are actively pursuing new project partners to invest in our ongoing development efforts and are investigating possibly implementing a different project scope and end product for our yima joint ventures and our gc joint venture and may possibly be expanding both the size and scope of our zz joint venture plant 
our yima project is currently under construction and yima is the project management leader for the project 
during the three months ended september   yima indicated their intent to convert the existing project from methanol production to glycol production 
yima has expressed their belief that the prospect for strong economic performance of the plant can be improved by modifying the backend of the project to make glycol 
in addition  yima has acquired a nearby coal to methanol facility and is looking to diversify and sees glycol as a potentially more profitable alternative 
we have indicated to yima that we would be willing to support this scope change if both parties can agree upon appropriate modifications to the joint venture contracts that can improve our overall risk and return without requiring any additional capital investment from us 
yima s project management team believes that the project s syngas production facilities will be brought online in mid as per the original schedule for commercial operation 
although the schedule for glycol production is currently under evaluation  yima is taking steps to connect the syngas production facility with their east and west coal chemical zones to provide an outlet for syngas sales prior to glycol production 
we are continuing to have discussions with yima to restructure the agreements as necessary to achieve these goals 
we are of the view that by improving financial performance and reducing operating costs at the zz joint venture plant our overall financial performance can be improved  and one method to achieve this is by expanding the zz joint venture plant to produce products such as glycol 
as an interim step to producing glycol  however  the existing contractual arrangement with hai hua could be modified which would allow us to participate directly in methanol sales 
hai hua  to date  has been unable to offtake the volume of syngas envisaged in the original plant design and as a result  the plant has incurred operating losses 
we do not foresee this situation changing significantly in the near term  although hai hua has indicated that they may be able to take advantage of higher gasifier utilization if we are able to alter the composition of our syngas to fit their needs 
in an effort to improve the return on our investment in this plant  we are currently evaluating several alternative products and partnership structures  including participation in methanol sales  and are considering a possible expansion of the zz joint venture plant to produce products such as glycol 
we are in discussions with several potential partners on this contemplated expansion 
in february  we received the necessary government approval for such an expansion 
these approvals  along with previously received environmental approvals  are necessary in order for us to commence execution of the expansion 
the approvals document certain terms of the expansion  including  but not limited to  the project s use of land  additional facilities required  use of existing facilities  etc 
the exact size and scope of the expansion  however  is still under evaluation 
in addition  our successful commercial scale demonstration at the zz joint venture plant using lignite coal from the inner mongolia region of china was a significant milestone for us and our u gas technology as it demonstrated our ability to efficiently process lignite coal 
as a result of the lignite demonstration  we have seen an increase in visits to our zz joint venture plant from potential customers and partners 
we intend to continue to leverage our success to date at the zz joint venture in our ongoing business development efforts  including through further visits from senior executives of possible customers and partners  as well as government officials 
despite our work with hai hua on improving financial performance and reducing costs  hai hua has not made the capacity fee payments to the zz joint venture since april as described under results of operation 
the unpaid amount totals approximately  as of june  although we are continuing to work with hai hua on alternatives to resolve the issue  there can be no assurances that we will collect these amounts 
hai hua s failure to make capacity fee payments could lead us to shut down the zz joint venture plant for a period of time until we are able to either find an alternative purchaser of our production or a different use for the plant 

table of contents we believe that there is currently a shift in the coal gasification business toward the use of low quality  and therefore low cost  coals for coal to energy and chemicals projects and we believe that china is a good example of this new direction in coal gasification 
in china  coal prices for high quality coals has risen dramatically over the past few years and these high coal prices have had a very negative impact on the margins of current coal gasification projects 
in order to fuel its energy needs  china today is moving toward even larger coal based projects  which include several large scale coal to methane or sng projects  as compared to previous coal to chemical projects 
due to current encouragement from the chinese government  we believe there is potential in china for several of these projects  some of which currently are in various stages of planning 
we believe many of these projects will be located in regions where very low cost lignite coals can be made available reducing production costs of sng and enhancing the profitability of these kinds of projects 
as we have determined with testing at our zz joint venture plant  our technology has the unique ability to efficiently process lignite and thus we believe it is very desirable for projects of the type the chinese government appears to support 
as evidence of this  we are in discussions regarding several projects in inner mongolia where the provincial government is making coal resources available to the project owners which adds protection for the project from future coal cost increases  as well as potentially increasing project revenues 
in these types of projects  we believe that we have the opportunity to create more value from the u gas technology than licensing alone could bring us 
we expect to continue for a period of time to have negative operating cash flows until we can generate sufficient revenues from our licensing and related service projects  as well as from the zz joint venture  the yima joint ventures and other projects which are under development  to cover our general and administrative expenses and other operating costs 
in addition  if we are not able to complete the zjx china energy transaction  we will need to aggressively pursue additional partners in china and may need to cut our operating expenses 
we will also limit the development of any further projects until we have assurances that acceptable financing is available to complete the project 
despite this  we will continue to pursue the development of selective projects with strong and credible partners or off takers where we believe equity and debt can be raised or where we believe we can attract a financial partner to participate in the project 
we can make no assurances that our business operations will develop and provide us with sufficient cash to continue operations 
we may need to raise additional capital through equity and debt financing for any new projects that are developed  to support our existing projects and possible expansions  and to meet corporate general and administrative expenses 
we cannot provide any assurance that any financing will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms or at all 
any such financing could be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
if we cannot raise required funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to  among other things  i maintain our general and administrative expenses at current levels  ii successfully develop our licensing and related service businesses  iii negotiate and enter into new gasification plant development contracts and licensing agreements  iv expand our operations  v hire and train new employees  or vi respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires our management to make certain estimates and assumptions which are inherently imprecise and may differ significantly from actual results achieved 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies due to the significance  subjectivity and judgment involved in determining our estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis utilizing historic experience  anticipated future events or trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the resulting effects of changes in our estimates are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the period in which the facts and circumstances that give rise to the change in estimate become known 
we believe the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue from sales of products  which includes the capacity fee and energy fee earned at the zz joint venture plant  and byproducts are recognized when the following elements are satisfied i there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  ii there is persuasive evidence that an agreement exists  iii delivery has occurred  iv the sales price is fixed or determinable  and v collectability is reasonably assured 

table of contents technology licensing revenue is typically received and earned over the course of a project s development 
we may receive upfront licensing fee payments in addition to fees for engineering services that are integral to the initial transfer of our technology to a customer s project 
typically  the majority of a license fee is received once project financing and equipment installation occur 
recognition of upfront licensing fee payments is deferred and recognized as a percentage of completion of the engineering services associated with the initial technology transfer 
further  such revenues are deferred until performance guarantee terms under the licensing agreement are met 
we recognize revenue from engineering services under the percentage of completion method 
impairment evaluation of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  construction in progress  equity method investments and specifically identified intangibles  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
when we believe an impairment condition may have occurred  we are required to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows associated with a long lived asset or group of long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for long lived assets that are expected to be held and used 
we evaluate our operating plants as a whole 
production equipment at each plant is not evaluated for impairment separately  as it is integral to the assumed future operations of the plant 
all construction and development projects are reviewed for impairment whenever there is an indication of potential reduction in fair value 
if it is determined that it is no longer probable that the projects will be completed and all capitalized costs recovered through future operations  the carrying values of the projects would be written down to the recoverable value 
if we determine that the undiscounted cash flows from an asset to be held and used are less than the carrying amount of the asset  or if we have classified an asset as held for sale  we estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment charge 
the following summarizes some of the most significant estimates and assumptions used in evaluating if we have an impairment charge 
undiscounted expected future cash flows 
in order to estimate future cash flows  we consider historical cash flows and changes in the market environment and other factors that may affect future cash flows 
to the extent applicable  the assumptions we use are consistent with forecasts that we are otherwise required to make for example  in preparing our other earnings forecasts 
the use of this method involves inherent uncertainty 
we use our best estimates in making these evaluations and consider various factors  including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  and operating costs 
however  actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
fair value 
generally  fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
we will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment 
we may also consider prices of similar assets  consult with brokers  or employ other valuation techniques 
we use our best estimates in making these evaluations  however  actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
the evaluation and measurement of impairments for equity method investments such as our equity investment in the yima joint ventures involve the same uncertainties as described for long lived assets that we own directly 
similarly  our estimates that we make with respect to our equity and cost method investments are subjective  and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material 
zz joint venture plant impairment analysis the zz joint venture plant has operated at limited capacity and is expected to continue operating at reduced capacity due to the depressed methanol market and limited off take by hai hua 
the reduced capacity at the zz joint venture plant has contributed to the plant s operating losses 
in addition to funding these operating losses  we are funding the debt service for the zz joint venture 
we are in the process of implementing operational measures  pursuing additional customers and evaluating strategies to reduce the zz joint venture s losses and improve its financial performance including the possible expansion of the plant to produce other products and sharing in methanol production with hai hua 
if an expansion of the zz joint venture plant were to be developed  we would expect to contribute our interest in the zz joint venture to the project 
if we are not successful in improving the zz joint venture s profitability  or if management s estimated cash flow projections for these assets decrease  or if hai hua does not make its required payments  the plant s assets could become impaired 
as of june   we have determined that these assets were not impaired 

table of contents despite our work with hai hua on improving financial performance and reducing costs  hai hua has not made the capacity fee payments to the zz joint venture since april as described under results of operation 
the unpaid amount totals approximately  as of june  although we are continuing to work with hai hua on alternatives to resolve the issue  there can be no assurances that we will collect these amounts 
hai hua s failure to make capacity fee payments could lead us to shut down the zz joint venture plant for a period of time until we are able to either find an alternative purchaser of our production or a different use for the plant 
accounting for variable interest entities and financial statement consolidation criteria the joint ventures which we enter into may be considered variable interest entities  or vies 
we consolidate all vies where we are the primary beneficiary 
this determination is made at the inception of our involvement with the vie 
we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors and form a conclusion that we  or another interest holder  absorb a majority of the entity s risk for expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s potential for expected residual returns  or both 
we do not consolidate vies where we are not the primary beneficiary 
we account for these unconsolidated vies under the equity method of accounting and include our net investment in investments on our consolidated balance sheets 
our equity interest in the net income or loss from our unconsolidated vies is recorded in non operating income expense on a net basis on our consolidated statement of operations 
we have determined that the zz joint venture is a vie and that we are the primary beneficiary 
in addition  we considered whether the terms of the syngas purchase and sale agreement with hai hua contained a lease 
the factors considered included i our ability to operate and control the plant during the initial years  and ii whether it was more than remote that one or more parties other than hai hua would purchase more than a minor amount considered to be of the plant s output during the term of the syngas purchase and sale agreement 
because we determined that the syngas purchase and sale agreement did not contain a lease  we account for the revenues from this agreement in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for product sales 
we have determined that the yima joint ventures are vies and that yima is the primary beneficiary since yima has a ownership interest in the yima joint ventures 
we have determined that the gc joint venture is a vie and that we are the primary beneficiary since we have a ownership interest in the gc joint venture and since there are no qualitative factors that would preclude us from being deemed the primary beneficiary 
we have determined that srs is a vie and that neither we nor midas is the primary beneficiary since we each have a ownership interest in srs and the control  risks and benefits of srs are shared equally 
off balance sheet arrangements in january  we entered into a month lease agreement  with a month optional renewal  for our corporate offices in houston  texas 
the lease commenced on march  with rental payments of  per month for the first year and escalating thereafter annually 
contractual obligations our material contractual obligations at june  were as follows in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years zz joint venture long term bank loan  including interest operating leases total recently issued accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued an amendment to the disclosure requirement related to fair value measurements 
the amendment requires new disclosures related to transfers in and out of levels and and activity in level fair value measurements 
a reporting entity is required to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers 
additionally  in the reconciliation for fair value measurements in level  a reporting entity must present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross  rather than net  basis 
the new disclosures were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the only impact is potential additional disclosure in the financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb also issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of vies 
this amendment requires an enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis when determining whether or not it must consolidate a vie 
the amendment also requires an enterprise to continuously reassess whether it must consolidate a vie 
additionally  the amendment requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with vies and any significant change in risk exposure due to that involvement  as well as how its involvement with vies impacts the enterprise s financial statements 
finally  enterprises are required to disclose significant judgments and assumptions used to determine whether or not to consolidate a vie 
this amendment was adopted by us effective as of july  and adoption of the standard has not impacted the entities which we consolidate 
the only impact is potential additional disclosure in the financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included herein for disclosures regarding our involvement with vies 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for transfers of financial assets 
this amendment applies to the financial reporting of a transfer of financial assets  the effects of a transfer on an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows  and a transferor s continuing involvement  if any  in transferred financial assets 
it eliminates the exceptions for qualifying special purpose entities from the consolidation guidance and the exception that permitted sale accounting for certain mortgage securitizations when a transferor has not surrendered control over the transferred financial assets 
the requirements in the amendment must be applied to transfers occurring on or after the effective date 
our adoption of these requirements as of july  had no effect on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued guidance for the disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
this guidance amends existing disclosure guidance to require an entity to provide a greater level of disaggregated information about the credit quality of its financing receivables and its allowance for credit losses 
this guidance is effective for fiscal and interim periods beginning after december  our adoption of these requirements effective january  had no effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued accounting guidance for the milestone method of revenue recognition 
this guidance allows entities to make a policy election to use the milestone method of revenue recognition and provides guidance on defining a milestone and the criteria that should be met for applying the milestone method 
the scope of this guidance is limited to transactions involving milestones relating to research and development deliverables 
the guidance includes enhanced disclosure requirements about each arrangement  individual milestones and related contingent consideration  information about substantive milestones and factors considered in the determination 
our adoption of this guidance effective july  had no effect on our financial statements 
the fasb issued new guidance relating to revenue recognition for contractual arrangements with multiple revenue generating activities 
the asc topic for revenue recognition includes identification of a unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be allocated to separate the units of accounting  when applicable 
our adoption of this guidance effective july  had no effect on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk qualitative disclosure about market risk 
we are exposed to certain qualitative market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that could impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these risks through regular operating and financing activities  and may  in the future  use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to date 
foreign currency risk we conduct operations in china and our functional currency in china is the renminbi yuan 
our financial statements are expressed in us dollars and will be negatively affected if foreign currencies  such as the renminbi yuan  depreciate relative to the us dollar 
in addition  our currency exchange losses may be magnified by exchange control regulations in china or other countries that restrict our ability to convert into us dollars 
the people s bank of china  the monetary authority in china  sets the spot rate of the renminbi yuan  and may also use a variety of techniques  such as intervention by its central bank or imposition of regulatory controls or taxes  to affect the exchange rate relative to the us dollar 
in the future  the chinese government may also issue a new currency to replace its existing currency or alter the exchange rate or relative exchange characteristics by devaluation or revaluation of the renminbi yuan in ways that may be adverse to our interests 

table of contents commodity price risk our business plan is to purchase coal and other consumables from suppliers and to sell commodities  such as syngas  methanol and other products 
coal is the largest component of our costs of product sales and in order to mitigate coal price fluctuation risk for future projects  we expect to enter into long term contracts for coal supply or to acquire coal assets 
for the sale of commodities from our projects  fixed price contracts will not be available to us in certain markets  such as china  which will require us to purchase some portion of our coal and other consumable needs  or sell some portion of our production  into spot commodity markets or under short term supply agreements 
hedging transactions may be available to reduce our exposure to these commodity price risks  but availability may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge this exposure at all 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk through our loan with icbc 
interest under this loan is adjusted annually based upon the standard rate announced each year by the people s bank of china 
as of june   the applicable interest rate was 
we could also be exposed to the risk of rising interest rates through our future borrowing activities 
this is an inherent risk as borrowings mature and are renewed at then current market rates 
the extent of this risk as to our icbc loan  or any future borrowings  is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates 
customer credit risk when our projects other than the zz joint venture plant progress to commercial production  we will be exposed to the risk of financial non performance by customers 
to manage customer credit risk  we intend to monitor credit ratings of customers and seek to minimize exposure to any one customer where other customers are readily available 
as of june   hai hua  a related party  is our only customer for syngas sales and as such  we are exposed to significant customer credit risk due to this concentration 
in addition  as described under results of operation  hai hua has not made the capacity fee payments to the zz joint venture since april the unpaid amount totals approximately  as of june  although we are continuing to work with hai hua on alternatives to resolve the issue  there can be no assurances that we will collect these amounts 
our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected if hai hua continues to not pay the capacity fee or if we are otherwise unable to retain hai hua as a customer and secure new customers and we may need to shut down the zz joint venture plant for a period of time until we are able to either find an alternative purchaser of our production or a different use for the plant
