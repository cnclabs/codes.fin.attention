under the agreement  amvac purchased the proprietary formulation information  registration rights  marketing materials  certain intellectual property rights and existing inventories of the agricultural and professional product lines 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data seasonality the agricultural chemical industry in general is cyclical in nature 
the demand for amvac s products tends to be seasonal 
seasonal usage  however  does not necessarily follow calendar dates  but more closely follows varying growing seasonal patterns  weather conditions and weather related pressure from pests  and customer marketing programs and requirements 
backlog amvac does not believe that backlog is a significant factor in its business 
amvac primarily sells its products on the basis of purchase orders  although it has entered into requirements contracts with certain customers 
customers tenkoz  crop production services  inc formerly united agri products  western farm services and crop production services  and helena chemical co 
accounted for   and  respectively of the company s sales in   and in  and   and in competition amvac faces competition from many domestic and foreign manufacturers in its marketplaces 
competition in amvac s marketplace is based primarily on quality efficacy  price  safety and ease of application 
many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources than amvac 
amvac s ability to compete depends on its ability to develop additional applications for its current products and expand its product lines and customer base 
amvac competes principally on the basis of the quality and efficacy of its products  its price and the technical service and support given to its customers 
generally  the treatment against pests of any kind is broad in scope  there being more than one way or one product for treatment  eradication  or suppression 
in most cases  amvac has attempted to position itself in smaller niche markets which are no longer of strong focus to larger companies 
intellectual property amvac s proprietary product formulations are protected  to the extent possible  as trade secrets and  to a lesser extent  by patents 
further  amvac s trademarks bring value to its products in both domestic and foreign markets 
although amvac considers that  in the aggregate  its trademarks  licenses  and patents constitute a valuable asset  it does not regard its business as being materially dependent upon any single trademark  license  or patent 
epa registrations amvac s products also receive protection afforded by the effect of the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act fifra legislation that makes it unlawful to sell any pesticide in the united states unless such pesticide has first been registered by the united states environmental protection agency usepa as well as under similar state laws 
substantially all of amvac s products are subject to usepa registration and re registration requirements and are conditionally registered in accordance with fifra 
this registration by usepa is based  among other things  on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data effects on human health or the environment when it is used according to approved label directions 
all states where any of amvac s products are used require a registration by that specific state before it can be marketed or used in that state 
state registrations are renewed annually  as appropriate 
the usepa and state agencies have required  and may require in the future  that certain scientific data requirements be performed on registered products sold by amvac 
amvac  on its own behalf and in joint efforts with other registrants  has furnished  and is currently furnishing  certain required data relative to specific products 
under fifra  the federal government requires registrants to submit a wide range of scientific data to support us registrations 
this requirement results in operating expenses in such areas as testing and the production of new products 
amvac expensed   and  during  and  respectively  related to gathering this information 
because scientific analyses are constantly improving  it cannot be determined with certainty whether or not new or additional tests may be required by the regulatory authorities 
additionally  while fifra good laboratory practice standards specify the minimum practices and procedures which must be followed in order to ensure the quality and integrity of data related to these tests submitted to the usepa  there can be no assurance the usepa will not request certain tests studies be repeated 
amvac expenses these costs on an as incurred basis 
see also part ii  item of this annual report for discussions pertaining to research and development expenses 
raw materials amvac utilizes numerous firms as well as internal sources to supply the various raw materials and components used in manufacturing its products 
many of these materials are readily available from domestic sources 
in those instances where there is a single source of supply or where the source is not domestic  amvac seeks to secure its supply by either long term arrangements or advance purchases from its suppliers 
amvac believes that it is considered to be a valued customer to such sole source suppliers 
environmental during  amvac continued activities to address environmental issues associated with its facility the facility in commerce  ca 
an outline of the history of those activities follows 
in  the california department of toxic substances control dtsc conducted a resource conservation and recovery act rcra facility assessment rfa of those facilities having hazardous waste storage permits 
during that same year  ten underground storage tanks located at the facility were closed 
in march  the rfa culminated in dtsc accepting the facility into its expedited remedial action program 
under this program  the facility was required to prepare and implement an environmental investigation plan 
depending on the findings of the investigation  the facility might also be required to develop and implement remedial measures to address any historical environmental impairment 
this activity then took two paths the rcra permit closure and the larger site characterization 
with respect to the permit closure  in  amvac began the formal process to close its hazardous waste permit at the facility which had allowed amvac to store hazardous waste longer than days as required by federal regulations 
formal regulatory closure actions began in and were completed in  as evidenced by dtsc s october  acknowledgement of amvac s closure certification report 
with respect to the site characterization  soil and groundwater characterization activities began in december in accordance with the site investigation plan that was approved by the dtsc 
additional activities were conducted from to with oversight provided by the dtsc 
additional analysis of 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data groundwater and soil are being conducted in response to federally mandated initiatives of similarly affected sites 
area wide groundwater studies of perchlorate typically associated with rocket fuel  explosives and fertilizer require the facility and neighboring sites to monitor existing wells for perchlorate in groundwater 
risk assessment activities have commenced and are likely to continue over the next year under the oversight of the dtsc 
following such risk assessment activities  further investigation and or potential remediation activities may be initiated in or at this stage  the extent of further investigation and potential remediation activities is uncertain 
further  it is uncertain whether the cost associated with such investigation and potential remediation activities will have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
because the risk assessment has yet to be completed  the company is unable to determine whether remediation is reasonably probable  nor can the cost of remediation be reasonably estimated the scope can vary depending upon the risk assessment and many other factors 
accordingly  the company has not set up a loss contingency with respect thereto 
amvac is subject to numerous federal and state laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee health and safety at the commerce  ca  marsing  id  hannibal  mo and axis  al facilities 
amvac continually adapts its manufacturing process to the environmental control standards of the various regulatory agencies 
the usepa and other federal and state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that could have an impact on amvac s operations 
amvac expends substantial funds to minimize the discharge of materials in the environment and to comply with the governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment 
wherever feasible  amvac recovers raw materials and increases product yield in order to partially offset increasing pollution abatement costs 
the company is committed to a long term environmental protection program that reduces emissions of hazardous materials into the environment  as well as to the remediation of identified existing environmental concerns 
as part of its continuing environmental program  except as disclosed in part i  item  legal proceedings  of this form k  the company has been able to comply with such proceedings and orders without any materially adverse effect on its business 
employees as of december   the company employed approximately employees 
amvac  on an ongoing basis  due to the seasonality of its business  uses temporary contract personnel to perform certain duties primarily related to packaging of its products 
the company believes it is cost beneficial to employ temporary contract personnel 
none of the company s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
the company believes it maintains positive relations with its employees

item a 
risk factors the regulatory climate has grown increasingly challenging to the company s interests both domestically and internationally 
under the current us administration  various agencies within the federal government have begun to exercise increased scrutiny in permitting continued uses or the expansion of such uses of older chemistries  including many of the company s products and  in some cases  have initiated or entertained challenges to these uses 
at the regulatory level  the principles of sound science to which the company has always subscribed have been adulterated  in some cases  by political considerations 
the challenge of the regulatory climate is even more pronounced in certain other geographical regions  most especially the european union and brazil  where the company faces resistance toward the continued use of certain of its products 
there is no guarantee that this climate will change in the near term 
nor is there any guarantee that the company will be able to maintain or expand the uses of many of its products in the face of these regulatory challenges 
in particular  as more fully described in legal proceedings below  the company s fungicide  pentachloronitrobenzene pcnb is subject to a stop sale  use and restraining order ssuro issued by the united states environmental protection agency usepa in august on the ground that the confidential statement of formula csf supporting the product s registration does not list certain trace impurities 
while the company has filed an amended csf  is negotiating with usepa to effect the removal of the ssuro and has challenged the issuance of the ssuro through litigation that is currently pending  as long as the ssuro remains pending  the company is prohibited from selling pcnb products for domestic use 
there is no guarantee that usepa will lift the ssuro or will approve the amended csf 
further  it is possible that  through this process  the company will lose its pcnb registration in the us 
if this comes to pass  then the company would likely be required to write down intangibles and write off inventory  in whole or in part in a potentially material amount 
furthermore  the company would incur other costs related to inventory disposal and decommission costs 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data the company may be subject to environmental liabilities 
the company  its facilities  and its products are subject to numerous federal and state laws and governmental regulations concerning hazardous materials  environmental matters and employee health and safety 
the company continually adapts its manufacturing process to the environmental control standards of the various regulatory agencies 
the us usepa and other federal  state and foreign agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that could have a significant impact on the company s operations 
the company expends substantial funds to minimize the discharge of materials into the environment and to comply with governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment and its workforce 
federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of the various laws and governmental regulations  and could  among other things  impose liability on the company for cleaning up the damage resulting from release of pesticides and other agents into the environment 
further  while the company continually adapts its manufacturing process to the environmental control standards of regulatory authorities  it cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous or regulated materials 
in the event of such contamination or injury  the company may be held liable for significant damages or fines 
in the event that such damages or fines are assessed  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial and operating results 
use of the company s products is subject to continuing challenges from activist groups 
use of the company s products is regularly challenged by activist groups in many jurisdictions under a multitude of federal and state statutes  including fifra  the food quality protection act  endangered species act  and the clean water act  to name a few 
these challenges typically take the form of lawsuits or administrative proceedings against the usepa and or other federal or state agencies  the filing of amicus briefs in pending actions  the introduction of legislation that is inimical to the company s interests  and or adverse comments made in response to public comment invited by usepa in the course of registration  re registration or label expansion 
the company spends considerable resources anticipating and defending these challenges 
while we have had some success in maintaining the continued uses of many of our products in the face of this onslaught  it is possible that one or more of these challenges could succeed  resulting in a material adverse effect upon one or more of our products 
the company s business may be adversely affected by cyclical and seasonal effects 
the chemical industry in general is cyclical and demands for its products tend to be seasonal 
seasonal usage follows varying agricultural seasonal patterns  weather conditions and weather related pressure from pests  and customer marketing programs and requirements 
weather patterns can have an impact on the company s operations 
the end user of some of its products may  because of weather patterns  delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting season  which may result in a reduction of the use of some products and therefore may reduce our revenues and profitability 
there can be no assurance that the company will adequately address any adverse seasonal effects 
the company faces competition in certain markets from manufacturers of genetically modified seeds 
the company faces competition from larger chemical companies that market genetically modified gmo seeds in certain of the crop protection sectors in which the company competes  particularly that of corn 
many growers that have chosen to use gmo seeds have reduced their use of pesticides sold by the company 
further  the federally mandated refuge acre requirement for corn which  in the name of preventing pest resistance  required growers using gmo seeds to set aside a percentage of their planting acres for non gmo seed  has been sharply reduced 
there is no guarantee that the company will maintain its market share or pricing levels in sectors that are subject to competition from gmo seed marketers or that federal mandates to set aside acreage for non gmo seed will continue 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data the company faces competition from generic competitors that source product from countries having lower cost structures 
the company continues to face competition from competitors that enter the market through making offers to pay data compensation and subsequently sourcing material from countries having low cost structures typically india and china 
these competitors typically operate at thinner gross margins and  with low costs of goods  drive pricing and profitability of subject product lines downward 
further  such competitors typically spend little on product stewardship and employ few personnel within the united states 
in effect  they tend to commoditize all products which they distribute  that is  they operate by offering the lowest price goods 
there is no guarantee that the company will maintain market share over generic competitors or that such competitors will not offer generic versions of the company s products in the future 
the company s key customers typically carry competing product lines and may be influenced by the company s larger competitors 
a significant portion of the company s products are sold to national distributors who also carry product lines of competitors that are much larger than the company 
typically  revenues from the sales of these competing product lines and related program incentives constitute a greater part of our distributors income than do revenues from sales and program incentives arising from the company s product lines 
further  these distributors are often under pressure to market competing product lines in favor of the company s 
in light of these facts  there is no assurance that such customers will market or continue to market our products aggressively or successfully or that the company will be able to influence such customers to purchase our products in favor of those of our competitors 
to the extent that capacity utilization is not fully realized at its manufacturing facilities  the company may experience lower profitability 
the company has pursued a business strategy of acquiring manufacturing facilities at a steep discount to their replacement value 
these acquisitions have enabled the company to be more independent of overseas manufacturers than some of our competitors 
while the company endeavors continuously to maximize utilization of these several facilities  our success in these endeavors is dependent upon many factors beyond our control  including fluctuating market conditions  product life cycles  weather conditions  availability of raw materials and regulatory constraints  among other things 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maximize its utilization of capacity at its manufacturing facilities 
to the extent that the company experiences excess manufacturing capacity  it may experience lower profitability 
reduced availability and higher prices of raw materials may reduce the company s profitability and could threaten the viability of some of its products 
in the recent past  there has been a material reduction in the number of suppliers of certain important raw materials used by the company in many of its products 
certain of these raw materials are available solely from sources overseas or from single sources domestically 
in the recent past  the price of these raw materials has fluctuated sharply 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to source some or all of these materials indefinitely or that it will be able to do so at a level of cost that will enable it to maintain its profit margin on its products 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data foreign currency and interest rate risk and the use of derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company engages in global business transactions 
where possible  the company does business in its functional currency 
however  there are certain situations in which the company is unable to transact in its functional currency and engages in agreements that require settlement in a different currency 
the company has in place one fixed interest rate swap with the objective of reducing the company s exposure to movements in the libor rate over time 
the hedges are evaluated at the end of each quarter and the effective portions of gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income  while the ineffective portions are recorded in current earnings 
quarterly variability in factors affecting the company s business may mean that an individual quarter s result may not provide a realistic picture of the company s overall performance 
due to elements inherent to the company s business  such as differing and unpredictable weather patterns  crop growing cycles  changes in sales mix  ordering patterns that may vary in timing  and promotional programs  measuring the company s performance on a quarterly basis  gross profit margins on a quarterly basis may vary significantly even when such comparisons are favorable  is not as meaningful an indicator as full year comparisons 
the primary reason is that the use cycles do not necessarily coincide with financial reporting cycles 
the company s cost structure  the combination of variable revenue streams  and the changing product mixes  result in varying quarterly levels of profitability 
dependence on the company s banking relationship 
the company s main bank is bank of the west  a wholly owned subsidiary of the french bank  bnp paribas 
bank of the west has been the company s primary bank for more than years 
bank of the west is the syndication manager for the company s loans and acts as the counterparty on the company s derivative transactions 
the company reviews the creditworthiness of its banks on a quarterly basis via both credit agencies and face to face meetings with senior management of the banks 
management believes that the company has an excellent working relationship with bank of the west and the other financial institutions in the company s lender group 
there is no guarantee  however  that the company s lenders will be either willing or able to continue lending to the company at such rates and in such amounts as may be necessary to meet the company s working capital needs 
the distribution and sale of the company s products are subject to prior governmental approvals and thereafter ongoing governmental regulation 
the company s products are subject to laws administered by federal  state and foreign governments  including regulations requiring registration  approval and labeling of its products 
the labeling requirements restrict the use of and type of application for our products 
more stringent restrictions could make our products less desirable  which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
substantially all of the company s products are subject to the usepa registration and re registration requirements  and are conditionally registered in accordance with fifra 
such registration requirements are based  among other things  on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when used according to approved label directions 
all states where any of the company s products are used also require registration before they can be marketed or used in that state 
governmental regulatory authorities have required  and may require in the future  that certain scientific data requirements be performed on the company s products 
the company  on its behalf and in joint efforts with other registrants  have and are currently furnishing certain required data relative to its products 
there can be no assurance  however  the epa will not request certain tests or studies be repeated or that more stringent legislation or requirements will not be imposed in the future 
the company can provide no assurance that any testing approvals or registrations will be granted on a timely basis  if at all  or that its resources will be adequate to meet the costs of regulatory compliance 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data the company may be unable to integrate product line acquisitions successfully as part of its growth strategy  the company has acquired established product lines from other registrants 
the company made four such acquisitions in alone  these new product lines span markets in dozens of countries 
while the company has done considerable due diligence on these assets  there is no guarantee that the company will be able to fully integrate these products into their enterprise  nor is there any guarantee that the company will realize the same kind of revenues or profits that had historically been derived from these product lines by predecessor owners 
the manufacturing of the company s products is subject to governmental regulations 
the company currently operates three manufacturing facilities in los angeles  california  axis  alabama  and marsing  idaho and owns and has manufacturing services provided in a fourth facility in hannibal  missouri the facilities 
the facilities operate under the terms and conditions imposed by required licenses and permits by state and local authorities 
the manufacturing of key ingredients for certain of the company s products occurs at the facilities 
an inability to renew or maintain a license or permit or a significant increase in the fees for such licenses or permits could impede the company s access to key ingredients and increase the cost of production  which  in turn  would materially and adversely affect the company s ability to provide its products in a timely and affordable manner 
adverse results in pending legal and regulatory proceedings could have adverse effects on the company s business 
the company is currently  and may from time to time  be involved in legal and regulatory proceedings  including  for example  product liability claims 
a successful claim that is not insured may require the company to pay substantial amounts in damages 
such a liability could have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial and operating results 
for discussion on pending legal claims  please see item legal proceedings below 
the company relies on intellectual property that it may be unable to protect  or may be found to infringe the rights of others 
the company s proprietary product formulations are protected  to the extent possible  as trade secrets  and  to a lesser extent  by patents and trademarks 
most of the established products that the company has acquired that were patented are currently off patent because the patents have expired 
the company can provide no assurance that the way it protects its proprietary rights will be adequate or that its competitors will not independently develop similar or competing products 
further  the company can provide no assurance that it is not infringing other parties rights 
any claims could require the company to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  develop non infringing intellectual property  or acquire licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of asserted infringement 
the company relies on key executives in large part for its success 
the company s success is highly dependent upon the efforts and abilities of its executive officers 
the loss of the services of one or more key executive officers could have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial and operating results 
further  there is no guarantee that the company will be able to retain or to continue to attract qualified executives 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data the company is dependent on a limited number of customers  which makes us vulnerable to the continued relationship with and financial health of those customers 
in  three customers accounted for of the company s sales 
the company s future prospects will depend on the continued business of such customers and on our continued status as a qualified supplier to such customers 
the company cannot guarantee that our current significant customers will continue to buy products from us at current levels 
the loss of a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s business may be adversely affected by terrorist activities 
the company s business depends on the free flow of products and services through the channels of commerce 
recently  in response to terrorists activities and threats aimed at the united states  transportation  mail  financial and other services have been slowed or stopped altogether 
further delays or stoppages in transportation  mail  financial or other services could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  the company may experience an increase in operating costs  such as costs for transportation  insurance and security as a result of the activities and potential activities 
the company may also experience delays in receiving payments from counterparties that may have been affected by the terrorist activities and potential activities 
the us economy in general is being adversely affected by the terrorist activities and potential activities and any economic downturn could adversely impact results of operations  impair the ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely affect the ability to grow the business

item legal proceedings pcnb matters 
on or about april   the pest management regulatory agency pmra notified the company of its intention to cancel the canadian registration for the compound  pentachloronitrobenzene pcnb in that country  citing as a reason the company s failure to provide certain manufacturing data to the agency in a timely fashion 
the company subsequently provided the agency with the required data  and pmra extended its notice to permit continued registration through at least the end of the calendar year 
further  in june  pmra issued a re evaluation of pcnb and concluded that turf uses should be cancelled as of the end of calendar year in august  the company filed a notice of objection to the re evaluation and sought a hearing on the matter at which to present technical data in support of that use 
pmra failed to respond to the notice of objection and has not set a hearing 
as of december   then  the turf use for pcnb was discontinued in canada 
the company has challenged this action on the ground that  among other things  pmra abused its discretion in failing to set a hearing on the company s objection 
in late february  pmra responded to the company s request for relief against cancellation and indicated that it was unwilling to reverse the cancellation informally 
accordingly  the company intends to take formal action to have the registration reinstated 
there is approximately  worth of pcnb inventory in the canadian distribution channel for which the company has not been paid 
in light of pmra s current position  it is possible that some or all of that material may be returned 
it is uncertain whether such goods will be returned 
further  it is unclear to what extent the goods can be repackaged and resold 
these questions may be dependent in part upon the outcome of the company s negotiations with usepa as per the following section 
the company believes that a loss is probable within the range of to  and has set up a loss contingency of we will revisit this reserve as negotiations with pmra and usepa develop further 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data in august  the usepa issued a stop sale  use and removal order ssuro relating to the company s usepa registered pcnb product line 
the company sells pcnb primarily for use on turf with the bulk of sales occurring in september and october 
in issuing the ssuro  the usepa alleged that the company s product did not comply with the confidential statement of formula csf due to the presence of trace impurities that are not listed on the csf 
the ssuro was issued by the agency without either i a specific finding of risk  ii providing the company an opportunity to present a technical case  or iii any forewarning 
despite its efforts  the company was unable to obtain informal resolution of the matter with the agency and  in an effort to protect its business  filed an action against usepa with the united states district court for the district of columbia in late august in which it sought emergency and permanent injunctive relief 
on september   that court denied the company s motion for emergency relief  finding in effect that while it was concerned about unfairness in usepa s actions  the agency was empowered to take those actions 
following the court s denial  the company filed an amended csf with the agency and is currently in discussion with usepa on technical matters relating to the csf 
just prior to the statutory deadline pria deadline  usepa stated that it needed more time to complete its risk assessment  and the company granted a day extension until march  and the parties held a meeting between their technical teams on march  at that meeting  the agency presented preliminary results of its health effects and impact of the impurity in certain pcnb products in light of the amended csf 
it should be noted that the agency s technical team is still working on the environmental fate effects analysis 
while it is too early to predict the agency s final position on the amended csf  the company is encouraged by the agency s preliminary health effects analysis as it relates to certain major uses 
at present  the parties are discussing a further extension of the pria deadline to facilitate further analysis and discussion between the technical teams 
the company continues to pursue a preliminary injunction through the litigation pending against usepa  no hearing has yet been set  but the court has been briefed by both sides 
at december   the company held inventories in the amount of  and associated intangible assets of  relating to this product line 
it is too early in the process to predict with any certainty how long the review at usepa may take  or what the agency s final conclusions will likely be with respect to either the csf or the ssuro 
accordingly  the company cannot conclude that a loss is probable and has not set up a loss contingency 
however  if the registration were to be cancelled  and the company were required to write off its inventory and intangible assets  such losses would be in the range of  not including inventory disposal and equipment cleanup and decommissioning costs 
it is possible that an inventory writeoff  if any  would be less than the then current value of inventory  as the company may be able to sell some or all of these goods outside of the united states over time 
a 
dbcp cases over the course of the past years  amvac and or the company have been named or otherwise implicated in a number of lawsuits concerning injuries allegedly arising from either contamination of water supplies or personal exposure to  dibromo chloropropane dbcp 
dbcp was manufactured by several chemical companies  including dow chemical company  shell oil company and amvac and was approved by the usepa to control nematodes 
dbcp was also applied on banana farms in latin america 
the usepa suspended registrations of dbcp in october  except for use on pineapples in hawaii 
the epa suspension was partially based on studies by other manufacturers that indicated a link between male sterility and exposure to dbcp among their factory production workers producing the product 
at present  there are approximately lawsuits  foreign and domestic  filed by former banana workers in which amvac has been named as a party 
fifteen of these suits have been filed in the united states with prayers for unspecified damages and the remainder have been filed in nicaragua 
three of these domestic suits were brought by citizens of nicaragua while the other domestic suits have been brought by citizens of other 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data countries 
these claims are all in various stages and allege injury from exposure to dbcp  including claims for sterility 
only two of the suits suazo and castillo  indicated below filed in nicaragua have been served on amvac 
over the course of  two actions that had been filed in the los angeles county superior court named mejia and rivera involving claims for personal injury to nicaraguan banana plantation workers allegedly arising from exposure to dbcp  were dismissed with prejudice by the court on its own motion with a finding of fraud on the court and blatant extortion of the defendants 
we believe that the court s findings in these cases has diminished the viability of the pending nicaraguan cases 
further  we believe that mejia and rivera have had an effect upon other cases involving exposure to foreign residents  most notably the several cases alleging injury to residents of the ivory coast pineapple plantation workers which were dismissed in by the los angeles superior court without prejudice  as plaintiffs counsel withdrew from the case and none other came forward to prosecute the action 
as described more fully below  of the cases that were still pending domestically in  patrickson has been dismissed and is on appeal  the mississippi and louisiana cases have lain dormant for many years  and adams and mendez  while early in litigation  appear to involve claims that largely do not concern amvac 
a 
hawaii matters patrickson  et 
al 
v 
dole food co  et 
al in october  amvac was served with a complaint s in which it was named as a defendant  filed in the circuit court  first circuit  state of hawaii and in the circuit court of the second circuit  state of hawaii two identical suits entitled patrickson  et 
al 
v 
dole food co  et 
al patrickson case alleging damages sustained from injuries caused by plaintiffs exposure to dbcp while applying the product in their native countries 
other named defendants include dole food co  shell oil company  and dow chemical company 
the ten named plaintiffs are citizens of four countries guatemala  costa rica  panama  and ecuador 
punitive damages are sought against each defendant 
the plaintiffs were banana workers and allege that they were exposed to dbcp in applying the product in their native countries 
the case was also filed as a class action on behalf of other workers so exposed in these four countries 
the plaintiffs allege sterility and other injuries 
after several years of law and motion activity  dow filed a motion for summary adjudication as to the remaining plaintiffs based on the statute of limitations  as they had filed suit in florida in all defendants joined in this motion 
the court granted this motion on june  plaintiffs counsel unsuccessfully argued that their claims were tolled by prior class action cases 
on november   the court denied a motion for reconsideration 
judgment in favor of the defendants was entered on july  on august   the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal 
this appeal is presently pending 
the company believes that the appeal filed by plaintiffs has no merit and intends to oppose the appeal 
the company does not believe that a loss is either probable or reasonably estimable and  accordingly  has not set up a loss contingency with respect thereto 
adams v 
dole food co 
et al on approximately november   amvac was served with a suit filed by two former hawaiian pineapple workers and their spouses  alleging testicular cancer due to dbcp exposure adams v 
dole food co 
et al in the first circuit for the state of hawaii 
the complaint was filed on june  and names dole food co  standard fruit and steamship company  dole fresh food  pineapple growers association  amvac  shell oil co  dow chemical co 
and occidental corporation 
plaintiff mark adams alleges he was exposed to dbcp in and while working on dole s plantation on oahu 
plaintiff nelson ng alleges he was exposed between and while working in lanai city  lanai 
amvac answered the complaint on or about 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data december  while little discovery has taken place  amvac denies that any of its product could have been used at the times and locations alleged by these plaintiffs 
dole food co 
was dismissed on the basis of the exclusive remedy of worker s compensation benefits as it was the employer of plaintiffs 
however  plaintiffs have been granted relief to seek an interim appeal as to the dismissal of dole 
a stay has been placed on discovery other than to obtain written records 
this appeal as to dole is pending 
the company does not believe that a loss is either probable or reasonably estimable and has not accrued a loss contingency 
mendez et al 
v 
the dow chemical company et al 
on june   nine complaints were filed in the circuit court of the first circuit for the state of hawaii  a representative one of which is captioned mendez et al 
v 
dow chemical company et al 
these complaints were filed by the same attorneys representing the patrickson and adams plaintiffs 
a total of individual workers of whom are from panama  six from ecuador and four from costa rica seek damages for physical injuries allegedly arising from exposure to dbcp in the s 
other defendants named in the lawsuits include shell oil company  occidental petroleum corporation  dole food company  and amvac chemical corporation 
amvac was served with the complaints on november  and answered on january  there has been no discovery to date 
amvac intends to defend these matters vigorously citing  among other things  the fact that  to its best knowledge  it has never sold dbcp to certain of the countries identified in the complaints 
thus  it is unknown as to how many of the plaintiffs claim exposure to amvac s product  what are the actual injuries  and whether their claims are barred by applicable statutes of limitation or other defenses 
the company believes that a loss is neither probable nor reasonably estimable and has not accrued a loss contingency 
b 
mississippi matters in may  amvac was served with five complaints in which it is named as a defendant 
these complaints were filed by the same attorneys representing the patrickson plaintiffs in hawaii 
the complaints are brought by plaintiffs edgar arroyo gonzalez  eulogio garzon larreategui  valentinvaldez  amilcar belteton rivera  and carlos nicanor espinola e against a number of defendants  including shell oil company  dow chemical co  and dole food company 
the cases were filed in the circuit court of harrison county  first judicial district of mississippi 
each case alleged damages sustained from injuries caused by plaintiffs who are former banana workers and citizens of a central american country exposure to dbcp while applying the product in their native countries 
these cases were removed to us district court for the southern district of mississippi  southern division 
the federal court granted defense motions to dismiss in each case pursuant to the doctrine of forum non conveniens 
inconvenient forum 
on january   the court issued an unpublished decision  finding that there was jurisdiction in federal court  but remanded just one case espinola e back to the trial court based on a stipulation which limited the plaintiff s recovery to fifty thousand dollars 
no activity has taken place on this matter since without discovery  it is unknown whether this plaintiff was exposed to the company s product or what defenses may apply 
amvac intends to contest the cases vigorously 
the company does not believe that a loss is either probable or reasonably estimable and has not accrued a loss contingency 
c 
louisiana matters in november  amvac was served with three complaints filed in the th judicial district court for the parish of st 
charles  state of louisiana entitled pedro rodrigues et 
al v 
amvac chemical corporation et 
al  andres puerto  et 
al v 
amvac chemical corporation  et 
al and eduardo soriano  et al v 
amvac chemical corporation et 
al 
other named defendants include dow chemical company  shell oil company  and dole 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data food 
these suits were filed in  but they were not served until november following a dismissal of most of the plaintiffs from the action in light of the fact that they had previously settled their claims in other actions  the complaints  with soriano as the lead case  allege personal injuries to about persons from ecuador  from costa rica  and from guatemala from alleged exposure to dbcp punitive damages are also sought 
there has been no discovery in these cases to date and no procedural activity of any kind since february it is unknown as to how many of the plaintiffs claim exposure to amvac s product  what are the actual injuries  and whether their claims are barred by applicable statutes of limitation 
amvac intends to vigorously contest these cases 
the company does not believe that a loss is either probable or reasonably estimable and has not accrued a loss contingency 
d 
nicaragua matters suits filed in nicaragua a review of court filings in chinandega  nicaragua  by local counsel has found suits filed pursuant to public law that name amvac and include approximately  plaintiffs 
however  only two cases  castillo and suazo  have been served on amvac 
all but one of the suits in nicaragua have been filed pursuant to special law  an october nicaraguan statute that contains substantive and procedural provisions that nicaragua s attorney general previously expressed as unconstitutional 
each of the nicaraguan plaintiffs claims  in compensatory damages and  in punitive damages 
in all of these cases  amvac is a joint defendant with dow chemical and dole food company  inc in the two cases pending before nicaraguan courts in which amvac has been served  the court has denied amvac s objection to jurisdiction  which is being appealed 
in may  two suits filed in nicaragua in were received that name amvac  the dow chemical company  dole food co  dole fresh fruit  and standard fruit company 
the two suits for personal injuries for sterility and reduced sperm counts have been filed on behalf of a total of banana workers flavio apolinar castillo et al 
v 
amvac chemical corporation et al  no 
and luis cristobal martinez suazo et al 
v 
amvac chemical corporation et al  no 
in december  amvac received six additional  similar lawsuits filed on behalf of a total of plaintiffs 
on january   amvac was served with the suazo and castillo suits  and in march  counsel in nicaragua filed objections to jurisdiction over amvac in these two cases 
the court finally ruled on all the defendants objections on march  by denying each objection to jurisdiction 
amvac contends that the nicaragua courts do not have jurisdiction over it and that public law violates international due process of law 
amvac intends to contest personal jurisdiction and demand under law that the claims be litigated in the united states 
thus far  it appears that the nicaraguan courts have denied all requests of other defendants under law that allow the defendants the option of consenting to jurisdiction in the united states 
it is not presently known as to how many of these plaintiffs actually claim exposure to dbcp at the time amvac s product was allegedly used nor is there any verification of the claimed injuries 
based on the precedent of the earlier suits in nicaragua  it would appear likely that the nicaragua courts will  over the defendants objections  enter multi million dollar judgments for the plaintiffs and against all defendants in these cases 
however  to date  plaintiffs have not had success in enforcing nicaraguan judgments against domestic companies before us courts 
one such judgment not including the company was entered in august for  for plaintiffs against dole food and other entities 
it has also been reported that on december   the nicaraguan court rendered a judgment for  against dow  shell  occidental  and standard fruit for some plaintiffs 
an enforcement action entitled osorio against dole and dow for the  judgment was filed in the us district court in miami  florida 
in this enforcement action  on october   
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data the federal court issued a lengthy decision refusing to enforce the judgment on the grounds that law violated due process of law and that the nicaraguan courts were not impartial tribunals 
the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the eleventh circuit court of appeal on march  this appeal is still pending 
while the dismissal is being appealed  this decision and the findings in the mejia case may halt further attempts to enforce these foreign judgments 
b 
other matters archem superfund action 
on july   the texas commission on environmental quality tceq issued an administrative order the order under which it identified parties that are potentially responsible for solid waste and or hazardous substances at the archem thames chelsea state superfund site the site 
in that order  amvac was identified as one of potentially responsible parties prp s relating to tceq removal actions that were conducted at the site in and the total cost of such removal actions for which that group of prp s could be liable is approximately amvac s involvement in this matter purportedly arises from the single shipment of an intermediate compound sent to the site for further synthesis in the late s 
amvac has joined a group of prp s which has challenged the order by way of filing a petition with the district court of travis county  texas in a matter captioned akzo nobel etc 
et al 
v 
texas commission on environmental quality  cause no 
d n petitioners challenged the order on several grounds  including failure to provide prp s with an evidentiary hearing and the fact that petitioners should not be liable as arrangers under cercla  as they sent useful product not waste to the site 
during the fourth quarter of  petitioners and respondents have reached a settlement of the matter which  while subject to public comment and final approval  would require amvac to pay approximately in cash 
accordingly  the company has set up a loss contingency of wilson v 
gemchem 
on or about september   an action styled joseph k 
wilson v 
gemchem  inc etc  civ 
no 
cv  was filed in the civil court of mobile  alabama by a former employee who seeks compensation and medical expenses arising from physical injuries that he allegedly sustained when he tripped and fell at amvac s facility in axis  alabama 
the company does not believe that the claims have any merit and intends to defend the matter vigorously 
discovery has been taken on both sides 
at this stage  the company does not believe that a loss is either probable or reasonably estimable and has not set up a loss contingency therefor 
brazilian citation 
on or about october   ibama the brazilian equivalent of the usepa served the company s subsidiary  amvac do brasil  with a notice of violation alleging that two lots of granutox formulated product having phorate as the active ingredient stored at basf sa amvac s exclusive distributor in brazil and fmc quimica do brasil ltda 
which formulates end use product in that country were not in compliance with the end use registration on file with ibama 
specifically  ibama alleged that the color of the lots gray was inconsistent with the description in ibama s files pink 
ibama also indicated an intention to assess a fine of approximately against amvac do brasil 
the company has challenged the citation  among other reasons  on the ground that the change in color has to do with the removal of a coloring component and that such removal poses no environmental or toxicity risk 
at this stage  the company believes that a loss of is probable and has set up a loss contingency in the amount of item reserved

net sales of our crop business in are  which constitutes an increase of about over the net sales of  in net sales of non crop products for the period are  which constitutes a decrease of about over the net sales of  in a more detailed discussion of product groups and products having a material effect on net sales for each of the crop and non crop segments appear below 
with respect to our crop products  over the course of  market conditions were  for the most part  better than those of we entered with fairly lean inventory levels in the distribution channels  due to the 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data rigorous procurement practices of further  over the first half of  we were able to sell most of our seasonal products into the channel effectively  and favorable midwest weather conditions enabled us to sell product into both first and second quarters of while third quarter sales of our corn related products declined over historical levels as customers deferred their procurement activity for to take place closer to the growing season  we did see a resurgence in fourth quarter sales of those products 
further  in light of increased acres for both cotton and peanut crops year over year  we recorded strong sales of certain products for use with those crops over the course of the entire year 
we experienced a drop in sales of our fungicide product line over  due to the ssuro issued by usepa with respect to our domestic pentachloronitrobenzene product line  which  as noted below  caused us to miss the domestic turf season entirely 
a more detailed discussion of sales performance by our crop and non crop segments  further broken down by product group and product line  follows 
with respect to our crop segment  net sales of our insecticides in were up strongly by approximately to  as compared to  for the comparable period in within this segment  net sales of our granular soil insecticides were up approximately  largely due to increased net sales of counter in the first half of the year and fourth quarter  counter has experienced a resurgence in use on corn for nematode control and is proving to be efficacious for sugar beets where seed treatments are unable to control heavy pest pressure 
in addition  thimet sales increased year over year due to both increased peanut acres in the southeast and increased use for nematicidal control sugar cane 
net sales of our cotton insecticides increased by about over the prior year  this trend has resulted from an increase in cotton acres planted coupled with strong cotton prices 
within the product group of herbicides fungicides fumigants  net sales in were up slightly about over the year  v 

within this group  however  we had mixed results 
net sales of our herbicide products were up strongly by approximately  led by our post emergent corn herbicide  impact  due to both favorable weather conditions and a well executed plan of distribution  we saw strong sales in the first two quarters  then a lag in the third quarter as customers deferred procurement until closer to planting time and a resurgence in the fourth quarter  as growers anticipate the season 
our fumigants enjoyed mild gains in net sales year over year up by about  in fact  fourth quarter sales in  on an historical basis  were comparatively low  as adverse weather cut short the application season for this just in time product 
with better weather conditions  fumigant sales in have trended toward more historical norms 
net sales of our fungicides  however  were down sharply approximately during as compared to  due largely to pcnb on crop uses  which experienced a decrease in net sales in the first half of the year arising from formulation issues  and in the second half of the year from the ssuro issued by usepa for domestic product 
as described more fully in the legal proceedings section below  the company continues to negotiate with usepa to get the ssuro lifted and is also seeking a preliminary injunction from the federal district court 
within the segment of other products which includes plant growth regulators  molluscicides and tolling activity  we experienced a nearly increase in net sales during as compared to  v 

this increase is primarily due to strong sales of folex  a compound used for cotton harvest management  not only did we benefit from increased cotton acres  but also from the fact that we completed the acquisition of the domestic def tribufos product line from bayer cropscience in late july partially offsetting folex s gains was a drop in net sales of naa  a plant growth regulator used primarily for thinning apple blossoms  an early frost in late obviated the need for this product in  as growers still had inventory from the prior year for use in the season 
in addition  net sales of dacthal were up slightly year over year  while we have benefited from the lessening of water restrictions in the western states  we have experienced curtailment of uses in europe 
further  net sales of metaldehyde a molluscicide were up about 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data over the comparable period  this increase arose primarily from rainy conditions in the eastern and northern midwestern states and the attendant increase in slug and snail pressure 
tolling revenues decreased by approximately  in as compared to  as a result of one contract which occurred in and not in it should be noted that  included in sales were data compensation amounts of in and  in within our non crop segment  net sales were down by about  v 
 compared to this decline was due mostly to lost sales of pcnb on turf uses  the ssuro was issued in august  just before normal sales into that market 
on the positive side  naled sales our mosquito adulticide were up by about  despite persistent dry conditions in the south west 
net sales of pest strips more than tripled over the prior year  in light of the market s recognition that the active ingredient  ddvp  is one of the only compounds effective against bedbugs 
these gains  however  were offset in part by reduced sales of orthene  which due to heavy pricing pressure from generic competitors  continues to carry lower margins and less emphasis in our sales plans 
our cost of sales for was  or of net sales 
this compared to  or of net sales for the decline in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in arose primarily from three factors  first  in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a one time non cash charge in the amount of  relating to adjusting inventory values to net realizable value impacting our crop segment cost of sales by  and our non crop segment cost of sales by 
there was no such charge in second  plant capacity utilization improved in as compared to  underutilization costs declined from approximately  in to  in third  the mix of products sold in included a greater emphasis on higher margin sku s  a reduction in sales of products that are subject to pricing pressure from generic competition eg  orthene and bifenthrin  and a drop in tolling activity for third parties  which also carries lower margins 
gross profit ended at  or of net sales in as compared to  or of net sales in this increase is due to the non cash charge taken in the fourth quarter of and the other factors described in the immediately preceding paragraph

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data in addition to the above contractual obligations  of unrecognized tax liabilities have recorded as liabilities as of december  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled

our net sales for decreased to  as compared to  for the same period in year over year  net sales for the crop business are down  while net sales of our non crop segment are down 
there are four major factors that contributed to the company s financial performance in first  in the wake of the global credit crisis that has persisted for the past several quarters  many of our customers implemented policies of inventory reduction and procurement on a just in time basis 
as a result  customers deferred  and or placed limits upon  purchase orders for the company s goods 
based upon electronic data interchange edi data which measures actual on the ground use of our products  although the company found that sales to our customers who are primarily distributors are below levels  growers appear to be applying volumes similar to those applied in second  weather conditions  particularly rain in the midwest at corn planting season  a lack of precipitation in the south and southwest in the spring  a late soybean harvest and an early frost in potato planting regions in the fourth quarter  reduced demand for some of our key  higher margin products 
third  for much of  the company was engaged in an initiative to improve its balance sheet by  among other things  reducing inventory and scaling down its manufacturing activity in the face of short term demand reduction 
in the course of this initiative  the company sold lower margin goods and incurred unabsorbed manufacturing costs 
fourth  as more fully explained below  the company took a one time non cash charge in the amount of  in the fourth quarter of relating to inventory cost reductions arising primarily from our assessment of net realizable value 
these factors as they relate to specific product lines are further discussed in the following section 
in spite of adverse weather conditions in the midwest namely  persistent precipitation that delayed planting sales of our granular soil insecticides were down slightly approximately year over year 
led by our aztec product line  we experienced comparatively stronger sales of granular soil insecticides in the first half of versus however  this sales trend was offset by a decline late in the second half of  due in part to reduced use of our counter product line in sugar beets and to high levels of inventory in the channels 
net 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data sales of our leading product line  soil fumigants  were down about in as compared to this decline was due largely to a shortened application season caused by two factors first  a delayed harvest in the midwest prevented growers from applying the product as early as they historically do  and second  an earlier than usual onset of freezing and snow conditions in potato planting regions in the fourth quarter effectively cut the application season short 
net sales of our herbicides for were about lower than those of  due primarily to the sales performance of our post emergent corn herbicide  impact 
while the year started at or above targeted sales levels  in the second quarter  sales of impact declined significantly in part due to rainy conditions in the midwest delaying the corn planting season thereby affecting the use of post emergent herbicides generally and in part to customers electing to reduce their inventory 
during the fourth quarter of  sales of impact were also down compared to the same period of  as customers increasingly elected to defer product purchases until closer to the time of application in late winter or spring 
net sales of our insecticide product lines for were about lower than after a good start in  sales of our insecticides dropped in the second quarter of due to reduced acres in cotton on which bidrin is used and peanuts on which thimet is used and a decrease in pest pressure on cotton and other crops 
in the third quarter  sales of broad spectrum insecticide  orthene  increased 
however  that trend trailed off in the fourth quarter  as our product line faced generic pricing pressure and high inventory levels in the channel of trade 
in addition  a lack of precipitation and pest pressure in our primary markets resulted in a drop in sales of our mosquito adulticide  dibrom  during both third and fourth quarters of the decline in sales of this higher margin product negatively impacted both top and bottom line performance 
as noted in the vs 
comparison below  dibrom had record sales in in the face of a heavy hurricane season 
also declining in net sales year over year were our fungicides  which experienced a drop of in that period 
this decline resulted primarily from reduced international demand for our pcnb product line  as an international customer had ordered a multi year supply in and declined to order product in our plant growth regulators pgrs generated consistently strong sales performance all year  led by our naa product line  net sales of pgrs for were up approximately over those of also we saw solid performances from our two main foreign subsidiaries ie mexico and costa rica 
however  international sales as a whole performed below the levels achieved in the same period of this includes some impact from tight regional credit control  some large transactions in that have not repeated in the current year  and regulatory pressure in brazil and the european union 
our cost of sales for was  or of net sales 
this compared to  or of net sales for the same period in there are two primary reasons for this result 
first  in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a one time non cash charge in the amount of  relating to adjusting inventory values to net realizable value  these adjustments include identifying obsolete and slow moving items in the amounts of and  respectively  adjusting standards in the amount of  to reflect under utilized capacity due to significantly below normal output levels in two of our manufacturing sites  and  in annual adjustments to ensure all standard costs closely reflect actual costs 
the charge impacts our crop segment cost of sales by  and our non crop segment cost of sales by  in arriving at its inventory valuation  the company took into account  among other things  recent and current market conditions including pricing  demand  distribution and competitive products as well as cost of goods including the burden of unabsorbed manufacturing costs 
a material portion of the charge related to the product  fortress  and the balance related to counter  thimet and pcnb specifically relating to unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs as well as certain slow moving and obsolete skus 
beyond the non cash charge  the cost of goods was also adversely affected by trading performance over the course of  which  in turn  was driven by several factors 
first  gross profit as a percentage of sales was 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data reduced by tolling activities which benefited plant utilization but served to lower gross profit levels 
second  we experienced some price erosion on international sales made in order to maintain our market share in the face of heavy competitive pressure 
third  as part of our initiative to reduce inventory  we reduced factory throughput  thereby reducing the absorption of fixed costs 
furthermore  in the first quarter we experienced significant environmental cost overruns on the start up of a new product in production 
gross profit ended at  or of net sales in as compared to  and of net sales for this decline is predominantly due to the non cash charge taken in the fourth quarter and the increased cost of goods as described in the immediately preceding paragraph 
it should be noted that  when making comparisons with other companies financial statements  the company reports freight  delivery and warehousing costs in operating expenses and not as a part of cost of sales 
operating expenses in increased by  to  or of sales as compared to  or in the differences in operating expenses by specific departmental costs are as follows change selling general and administrative research  product development and regulatory freight  delivery and warehousing selling expenses increased by  to  as compared to  for the same period of the increase predominately relates to program expenses  which were up  due to delayed sales of granular soil insecticides from q of to q of in addition  we have had a full year of operations for our costa rica subsidiary which increased overall costs by we increased field staff in order to focus on product stewardship  sales and marketing at a cost of offsetting these costs  we reduced some advertising  promotional and other paid marketing costs by general and administrative expenses increased by to end at  for year ended december  this includes spending of  reported in the first quarter of  relating to a major potential acquisition  which was not completed 
legal expenses were up as compared to the prior year arising primarily from costs incurred in arbitrations to collect data compensation 
furthermore  we have made some selective key recruitments during the year which have overall increased costs by we have spent on tax consulting that has driven benefits in our tax rate during the year 
finally  we had some currency gains in which did not recurred in generating an increase in expense of these costs were offset by reduced accruals for incentive compensation of  reflecting the financial performance and other cost savings including officer and director voluntary compensation reductions 
research  product development costs and regulatory registration expenses increased by  to  for  as compared to  for the same period of the main drivers were increased product defense costs up relating to both recently acquired product lines and established product lines 
also  research and development spending was up  as we have increased our resources aimed at developing new products and different formulations to improve our range of product offerings 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data freight  delivery and warehousing costs for decreased by  to  or of sales as compared to  or of sales for the same period of this reduction as a percentage of sales reflects continued effort to control these expenses by careful distribution in the supply chain and savings related to urgent shipments coupled with lower sales levels

foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currencies of its customers in the last three fiscal years has adversely affected the company s ability to sell products at agreed upon prices denominated in us dollars 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not occur in the future 
should adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations occur in geographies where the company sells exports its products  management is not certain such fluctuations will or will not materially impact the company s operating results 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations during the past three years 
however  raw material prices have been increasing since late th quarter and will continue to increase in due to the growth in global economies  particularly in china and india 
this growth will put further pressure on supply demands of raw materials and will cause inflationary pressures to develop throughout and critical accounting policies certain of the company s policies require the application of judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these judgments are based on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  commonly accepted industry practices and other assumptions that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s critical accounting polices and estimates include revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts revenue from sales is recognized at the time title and the risks of ownership pass 
this is when the customer has made the fixed commitment to purchase the goods  the products are shipped per the customer s instructions  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the company has in place procedures to ensure that revenue is recognized when earned 
the procedures are subject to management s review and from time to time certain sales are excluded until it is clear that the title has passed and there is no further recourse to the company 
allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
estimates are developed using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  adjusted for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss

emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products eitf  the company classifies certain payments to its customers as a reduction of sales revenues and other payments as operating expenses 
the company describes these costs overall as programs 
programs are a critical part of doing business in the agricultural chemicals business place 
for accounting purposes  programs fall into two categories 
the first type of program is treated as a reduction in gross sales and includes market pricing adjustments  volume take up or other key performance indicator driven payments made to distributors or retailers at the end of a growing season 
the second type of program is treated as operating expenses and is effectively re imbursement of costs such as advertising  training  and other product stewardship type costs that we would otherwise spend ourselves and report as operating expenses each quarter management compares each sale transaction with published programs to determine what program liability has been incurred 
once this initial calculation is made for the specific quarter  sales and marketing management along with executive and financial management review the accumulated program balance and make assessments of whether or not customers are tracking in a manner that indicates that they will meet the requirements set out in the terms and conditions attached to each program 
this includes  for example  annual volume take up  product line advertising and stewardship activities 
if management believes that customers are falling short of their annual goals then periodic adjustments will be made to the accumulated accrual to properly reflect the company s best estimate of the liability at the balance sheet date 
programs are paid out predominantly on an annual basis  usually in the first quarter of the financial year  though significant payments can also occur in the final quarter of a financial year 
long lived asset the carrying value of long lived assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
measurement of the impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
management considers the carrying value of long lived assets to be reasonable 
generally  the fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
property  plant and equipment and depreciation property  plant and equipment includes the cost of land  buildings  machinery and equipment  office furniture and fixtures  automobiles  construction projects and significant improvements to existing plant and equipment 
interest costs related to significant construction projects are capitalized at the company s weighted average cost of capital 
expenditures for maintenance and minor repairs are expensed as incurred 
when property or equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of  the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the respective accounts and the gain or loss realized on disposition is reflected in earnings 
all plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight line method  utilizing the estimated useful property lives 
building lives range from to years  machinery and equipment lives range from to years  office furniture and fixture lives range from to years  automobile lives range from to years  construction projects and significant improvements to existing plant and equipment lives range from to years when placed in service 
the agricultural chemicals business involves complex manufacturing processes that drive high capital cost plant 
foreign currency translation assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries  where the local currency is the functional currency  have been translated at period end exchange rates and profit and loss accounts have been translated using weighted average yearly exchange rates 
adjustments resulting from translation have been recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet as cumulative translation adjustments in other comprehensive income loss 
the effect of foreign currency exchange gains and losses on transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency using the end of the period exchange rates 
the effects of remeasurement related to foreign currency transactions are included in current profit and loss accounts 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data derivative financial instruments and hedge activities in accordance with fasb asc 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company recognizes all derivative instruments as either other assets or other liabilities at fair market value on the balance sheet 
in accordance with the hierarchy contained in fasb asc 
sfas  fair value measurements  the company calculated fair value using observable inputs other than level quoted prices level 
at december   and  the company had no hedges in place related to foreign currency exposure 
the company did enter into one foreign currency hedge during and was settled in during  there were no such hedges utilized 
at december   the company had in place one interest rate swap contract that is accounted for under fasb asc at december   the company had in place two such swap contracts 
the company qualifies for the short cut method for these swaps and performs quarterly re evaluations to determine continued qualification for this method 
any gains or losses on derivative instruments that are deemed effective are taken as an adjustment to other comprehensive income loss 
if any contracts are deemed ineffective  then gains and losses in those contracts are taken as an adjustment to operating income 
as at december  and  the company s derivative instruments have been tested and no charge has been taken to income in both years 
goodwill and other intangible assets the primary identifiable intangible assets of the company relate to product rights associated with its product acquisitions 
the company adopted the provisions of fasb asc 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the provisions of fasb asc  identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those with indefinite lives are not amortized 
the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset to the company is based upon a number of factors including the effects of demand  competition  and expected changes in the marketability of the company s products 
the company re evaluates whether these intangible assets are impaired on an annual basis  relying on a number of factors including operating results  business plans and future cash flows 
identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate elements of property 
the impairment test for identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization consisting of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss  if any  is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires the company to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset s being tested for impairment as well as selecting a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows 
when determining future cash flow estimates  the company considers historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by the company  in such areas as future economic conditions  industry specific conditions  product pricing and necessary capital expenditures 
the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for long lived assets  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
the company has performed an impairment review for the year ending december and there were no impairment losses recorded 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  primarily from its borrowing activities 
the company s indebtedness to its primary lender is evidenced by a line of credit with a variable rate of interest  which fluctuates with changes in the lender s reference rate 
the company uses derivative financial instruments for trading purposes to protect trading performance from exchange rate fluctuations on material contracts  also  as a condition of the company s credit agreement with its banks  the company is required to maintain in effect interest rate swap agreement s for a notional amount not less than one half of the principal amount of its term loan originally the term loan was  at any given time 
the company conducts business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe and mexico 
therefore changes in the value of the currencies of such countries or regions affect the company s financial position and

the company has mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of its currency exchange exposure through natural hedges based on the operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which the majority of all costs are local currency based 
a change in the value of all foreign currencies would have an immaterial effect on the company s financial position and cash flows
