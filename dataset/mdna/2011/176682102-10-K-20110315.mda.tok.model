item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is provided to assist readers in understanding and evaluating the financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this annual report 
additional discussion and analysis is contained in our quarterly reports filed on form q for the fiscal quarters ended march   june   and september  executive overview for the year ended december   the company reported net income available to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  a summary of the primary reasons for the change in net income is as follows in march the company acquired million in assets and assumed million of liabilities from bank of hiawassee in a fdic assisted transaction  net of fair value adjustments 
as a result of this transaction  the company posted an initial million pre tax gain from acquisition which was later adjusted to million 
also  as a part of the acquisition  the company acquired million in loans  net of fair value adjustments 
this contributed to the million increase in interest income 
in december the company recognized a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million which was the result of the company s annual goodwill impairment test 
in performing the impairment test  the company estimated the fair value of the reporting unit which was determined to be the company using a market value approach that utilizes the company s current stock price as the primary indicator of fair market value 
the results of the impairment test indicated that the million in outstanding goodwill was fully impaired and had a fair value of the company increased its provision for loan losses by million to million in as compared to million in the increased provision reflected the continued weakness of the overall economy in the company s local markets and the associated increased level of delinquent loans  as well as net charge offs for the year of million  or of average non covered loans 
at december   non covered nonperforming assets  which included non covered loans that were days or more delinquent  or in nonaccrual status  and other non covered real estate owned  amounted to million  or of total assets 
the company s net interest margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  this basis point improvement was primarily due to the company s cost of funds decreasing at a faster rate than its yield on assets 
during  the company s cost of funds decreased basis points  while its yield on assets decreased only basis points 
total shareholders equity increased by million to million at december  this increase was primarily due to a million capital raise during the year and million of net earnings for critical accounting policies and estimates the accounting and financial policies of the company and its subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices in the banking industry 
we consider accounting policies that require difficult or subjective judgment and assumptions by management that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations 
based on the size of the item or significance of the estimate  the following accounting policies are considered critical to our financial results 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb estimated probable loan losses inherent in the bank s portfolio at the measurement date 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires an estimate of the loss for each type of loan and for each impaired loan  an estimate of the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows  and an estimate of the value of the collateral 
management has established a systematic me thod for periodically evaluating the credit quality of the loan portfolio in order to establish an allowance for loan losses 
the methodology is consistently applied  set forth in a formal policy and includes a review of all loans in the portfolio on which full collectability may or may not be reasonably assured 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is consistently applied and is based on our past loan loss experience  particular risks inherent in the different kinds of lending that we engage in  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions  and other relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability 
specific allowances are established for certain individual loans that management considers impaired 
the remainder of the portfolio is segmented into groups of loans with similar risk characteristics for evaluation and analysis 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for loan losses against our current period income 
management believes this is a critical accounting policy because this evaluation involves a high degree of complexity and requires us to make subjective judgments that often require assumptions or estimates about various matters 
other than temporary impairment of securities 
the company reviews all investment securities with significant declines in fair value for potential other than temporary impairment on a periodic basis 
the company records an impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
generally changes in market interest rates that result in a decline in value of an investment security are considered to be temporary  since the value of such investment can recover in the foreseeable future as market interest rates return to their original levels 
however  such dec lines in value that are due to the underlying credit quality of the issuer or other adverse conditions that cannot be expected to improve in the foreseeable future  may be considered to be other than temporary 
management believes this is a critical accounting policy because this evaluation of the underlying credit or analysis of other conditions contributing to the decline in value involves a high degree of complexity and requires us to make subjective judgments that often require assumptions or estimates about various matters 
fair value of acquired loans 
the initial fair value of loans acquired in the march   fdic assisted acquisition of bank of hiawassee and the related fdic loss share receivable involved a high degree of judgment and complexity 
the carrying value of the acquired loans and the fdic receivable reflect management s best estimate based on information available at the time of the acquisition 
the amount we actually receive on these loans could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in the financial statements based upon the timing and collections on the acquired loans in the future 
to the extent that actual values realized for the acquired l oans are different from the initial estimates  the fdic loss share receivable will generally be impacted in an offsetting manner due to the nature of the fdic loss share agreements 
comparison of financial condition for the years ended december  and the discussion below is designed to provide a comparison of the company s financial condition from december   to december  the company s financial condition is primarily measured in terms of its composition of assets and liabilities and capital adequacy and liquidity 
assets total assets increased by million  or  from million at december   to billion at december  the primary reason for the increase was the acquisition of bank of hiawassee on march   which included million in total assets at fair value as described in further detail in note of this annual report 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents represents the company s interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposit accounts and cash on hand 
these assets increased by million from million at december   to million at december  this increase was primarily attributable to the million of net cash received from the acquisition of bank of hiawassee 
the primary component of the cash received in the acquisition was the million paid by the fdic to the company 
this payment by the fdic represented the million difference between the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the company s million negative bid  net of a deposit premium paid  for the acq uisition of bank of hiawassee 
the remaining million represents the existing cash and cash equivalents acquired from bank of hiawassee 
these increases were partly offset by a million decrease in borrowed money  million in cash dividends paid to common stockholders  and million in cash dividends paid to preferred stockholders 
management expects that cash and cash equivalents will decrease in as new loans are funded and excess liquidity is invested in higher yielding investment securities 
investment securities 
the company s investment security portfolio primarily consists of us treasury bonds  us government agency obligations  mortgage backed securities issued by government sponsored entities  and municipal bonds 
investment securities increased by million  or  from million at december   to million at december  the increase was largely due to the acquisition of bank of hiawassee which added million of investment securities 
these acquired securities primarily consisted of us government agency bonds  us government issued mortgage backed securities  and municipal bonds  which are comparable to the types of investment securities that were in the company s exist ing investment portfolio 
also the company sold million in investment securities and received proceeds from million in normal maturities  principal amortization  and calls 
the sales of investment securities during were primarily for the purpose of reducing longer term maturities and subsequently lowering the company s exposure to rising interest rates 
this increase in investment securities was partly offset by the purchase of million in investment securities in the securities purchased generally had shorter maturities or were designated as held to maturity in order to reduce the company s capital exposure to rising interest rates in the future 
management expects that in the balances of its investment securities portfolios will increase as management invests its excess liquidity in order to generate increased future earnings 
loans 
during  loans outstanding increased by million from million at december   to million at december  this increase in loans was primarily due to the acquisition of bank of hiawassee that included million of loans at december  excluding the loans acquired in the bank of hiawassee transaction  the company s total loans decreased by million 
most of this decrease was concentrated in speculative construction loans which decreased by million  or  to million at december   and commercial land and residential acquisition and development loans which decreased by million  or  to million at december  given the continued slowdown in the local economy and real estate markets  the company has focused on reducing its exposure to these types of loans 
historically  the company has not actively originated commercial real estate loans that are secured by hotels  motels  golf courses  or resort properties 
also  the company has not been an originator or purchaser of option adjustable rate or no documentation residential portfolio loans and the portfolio does not include any residential mortgage loans that are considered sub prime which are generally considered loans made to borrowers with lower credit ratings resulting from a poor payment history 
refer to lending activities and asset quality later in this section for further discussion 
other real estate owned 
real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned 
at december   we had million in other real estate owned compared to million at december  of the million of other real estate owned at december   million is covered by fdic loss share agreements 
the remaining million of non covered other real estate owned is comprised of million of one to four residential dwellings   of commercial real estate  and million of developed residential lots and undeveloped land 
all foreclosed properties are written down to their estimated fair value market value less estimated dis position costs at acquisition and are located in the bank s primary lending area 
management will continue to aggressively market foreclosed properties for a timely disposition 
premises and equipment 
the company operated full service branches in the charlotte and northern georgia regions at december  sixteen of these offices were owned by the company  including the corporate office and operations center  and the five other offices were leased 
during premises and equipment increased by million  or  to million at december  as part of the acquisition of bank of hiawassee  the company had an option to purchase the acquired bank s existing four full service offices and its operations center along with the existing premises and equipment which had a book balance of million at the time of the acquisition 
the acquisition price was determined by an independent fair market valuation of the properties and the related furniture and equipment 
the company also assumed the lease for the bank of hiawassee s fifth branch office 
during the third quarter of  the company acquired the existing four branch offices and related furniture and equipment for million 
the company did not acquire the acquired bank s operations center 
also during  the company recognized normal depreciation of million on its premises and equipment 
this depreciation was partly offset by the purchase of furniture and equipment for the company s new full service leased office in indian trail  north carolina 
this new office replaced the previous leased full service office in stallings  north carolina 
fdic loss share receivable 
the fdic loss share receivable relates to agreements with the fdic  whereby the fdic has agreed to reimburse to the company a percentage of the losses related to loans and other real estate that the company assumed in the acquisition of a failed bank 
this loss share receivable is measured separately from the loan portfolio and other real estate because it is not contractually embedded in the loans and is not transferable with the loans should the company choose to dispose of them 
the carrying value of this receivable is determined at each period end by multiplying the estimated amount of loan and other real estate losses covered by the agreements by the fdic reimbursement percentage 
th e company s loss share agreements with the fdic provide for coverage of up to of losses on covered loans and other real estate owned up to million and of coverage of any losses in excess of million 
intangible assets 
the company s intangible assets consist of million of core deposit intangibles that were booked in conjunction with the company s acquisition of trinity bank in and bank of hiawassee in these intangible assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis 
amortization expense in amounted to  compared to  in liabilities total liabilities increased by million  or  from million at december   to million at december  this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of bank of hiawassee that added total liabilities of million at acquisition date 
deposits 
the company offers a wide array of deposit products for small businesses and consumers including demand deposit accounts  money market deposit accounts  savings accounts  and time deposits 
during  the company s total deposits increased by million from million at december   to million at december  this increase in deposits was primarily fueled by the million in deposits assumed by bank of hiawassee during the first quarter of excluding the bank of hiawassee deposits  demand deposits  or checking accounts  increased by million  or  to million at december  management is committed to increasing demand deposit accounts and bu ilding new and enhancing existing customer relationships through improving technology  expanding its branch network and focused marketing efforts 
the company continues to focus on two products for both its commercial and retail customers that significantly contributed to the strong growth in demand deposit accounts in the first product is our remote deposit capture  which gives our commercial customers the ability to make deposits of checks remotely without physically visiting a branch office 
this allows our commercial sales force the opportunity to solicit business from commercial customers that may not be located near an existing branch office 
the second product is a high yield checking account product that compares favorably with some of our competitors who offer a higher interest rate on their checking account  but include numerous conditions in order to receive the higher rate 
in addition  we offer all day banking  which eliminated the pm cutoff for current day processing of deposits 
during  money market deposit accounts increased by million  or  to million at december  this growth was primarily due to million of deposits assumed from bank of hiawassee 
the remaining increase was partly due to consumers moving money from other financial institutions and brokerage accounts due to concerns about the safety of their principal during the height of the financial crisis in early also  some consumers rolled their maturing time deposits into these accounts because they provide a higher degree of liquidity and provide a competitive interest rate 
savings accounts increased by million  or  to million 
however  this increase was predominately due to the million of savings accounts assumed from bank of hiawassee 
time deposits increased million  or  to million at december  this increase was largely due to million of time deposits that were assumed from bank of hiawassee 
excluding these assumed deposits  then company s time deposits decreased by million 
this decrease was primarily du e to the low level of short term interest rates in  which made alternative investments more attractive to customers 
while management is committed to growing its deposit base from within the company s market area  we are focused on building relationships and we generally do not offer premium interest rates on time deposits to customers that do not have a banking relationship with our company 
from time to time  brokered time deposits may be used as an additional source of liquidity as needed 
however  historically we have not needed to solicit such brokered relationships and as of december   only  was brokered time deposits 
borrowed money 
the company s borrowed money includes advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb  repurchase agreements  retail repurchase agreements  and subordinated debt 
during our borrowed money increased by million from million at december   to million at december  this increase was primarily due to million of fhlb advances that were assumed in the bank of hiawassee acquisition 
the company repaid million of the fhlb advances assumed in the bank of hiawassee transaction in the second quarter of additional decreases in borrowed money were due to normal maturities during the period 
the company plans to use excess liquidity to repay these borrowings as they mature 
from time to time additional borrowed money may be used to fund additional loan growth  or to purchase investment securities 
shareholders equity 
total shareholders equity increased by million from million at december   to million at december  this increase was primarily due to net income of million during and the issuance of million of common stock  less million of issuance costs 
in march the company raised approximately million through direct sales to accredited investors of equity securities of the company the private placement 
under the terms of the private placement  the investors purchased  shares of the company s common stock at a purchase price of per share and  shares of a newly authorized series of the company s preferred stock  designated as mandatorily convertible cumulative  non voting perpetual preferred stock  series b the series b preferred stock at a purchase price and liquidation preference of  per share 
after the receipt of certain approvals  each share of the series b preferred stock converted into the company s common stock effective june   at an initial conversion price of per share of common stock 
upon conversion of the  shares of series b preferred stock   shares of the company s common stock were issued to the investors 
these increases in shareholders equity were partly offset by the payment of million in cash dividends on common stock 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and overview 
the company reported net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the primary contributing factor for the net income in was an million net gain on acquisition 
the primary reason for the loss in was the million goodwill impairment that was recognized as a result of the company s annual goodwill impairment evaluation testing 
net interest income 
net interest income is the largest component of our net income 
net interest income is the difference between total interest income  primarily on loan and investment portfolios  and interest expense  primarily on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is determined by the rates earned and paid on interest earning assets and interest costing liabilities  the volume  or amount  of interest earning assets and interest costing liabilities  and the mix of interest earnings assets and interest costing liabilities 
tables and following this discussion set forth certain information regarding the company s yield on interest earnings assets and cost of in terest bearing liabilities for the respective three year periods ended december table details the company s average assets and average liabilities and the respective yield or cost of each of the components that are detailed 
table sets forth information regarding changes in our interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated 
for each category of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to changes in volume  which are changes in average volume multiplied by the average rate for the previous period  changes in rates which are changes in average rate multiplied by the average volume for the previous period  and changes in rate volume  which are allocated equally between rate and volume variances 
the total change is the sum of the previous columns 
the company s net interest income increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  during the company experienced a basis point increase in the net interest margin from for to for this increase in the net interest margin was caused in part by a basis point decrease in the company s average cost of funds from in to for the benefit from the lower cost of funds was partly offset by a basis point decrease in the average yield on assets from in to in also contributing to the net interest margin expansion was a million increase in the company s average interest earning assets from milli on in to million in however  average interest bearing liabilities also increased by million from million in to million in which partly offset the effects of the increase in average interest earning assets 
interest income for the year ended december   increased by million  or  to million 
interest income from loans increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  this increase was caused by a million increase in the average balance of loans in to million 
this increase was partly offset by a basis point decrease in the average yield on loans in to reflecting lower market interest rates in interest earned on investment securities decreased by million to million in this decrease in interest income on investment securities was due to a basis point decrease in the average yield on investment securities coupled with a million decrease in the average out standing balance of investment securities to million in interest earned on interest bearing bank balances increased by  or  to  in this increase was primarily due to a million increase in the average balance in the average yield of interest bearing bank balances decreased by four basis points to in interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was largely due to a basis point decrease in the average cost of funds from in to in  reflecting lower market interest rates in interest expense on deposits decreased million  or  to million in this decrease was primarily due to a basis point decrease in the average cost of deposits to in  reflecting lower market interest rates in the positive impact of a decrease in the cost of deposits was partly offset by a million increase in average deposits in interest expense on borrowed money decreased by  or  to million in average borrowings increased by million  or  to million for  while the average rate paid on borrowings decreased by basis points to for average borrowings decreased due to maturities that were funded by cash flow funds generated from deposit growth 
the company may increase the level of borrowings to provide liquidity for operating purposes  to purchase investment securities  fund loan growth  and offset any deposit decreases 
if these borrowing levels increase  we expect there will be a corresponding increase in interest expense 
provision for loan losses 
the company provided million and million in loan loss provisions for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was at december   and at december  the provision for loan losses was increased due to an increase in non covered nonperforming assets  coupled with net charge offs of million during in  the charlotte metropolitan area experienced decreases in housing prices  an increased unemployment rate  decreased housing starts and housing sales and decreased commercial activity 
however  the economic slowdown in the charlotte metropolitan area has generally been less severe than the economic slowdown experienced in other large metropolitan areas of the country 
due to the slowdown in the local economy  the level of non covered nonperforming loans increased by million  to million at december  as a result  the ratio of non covered nonperforming loans to total non covered loans increased from at december   to at december  also  non covered other real estate owned increased by million to million at december   as a result  non covered nonperforming assets increased by million to million at december   resulting in an increase in the ratio of non covered nonperforming assets to total assets from at december   to at december  refer to adequacy of allowance for loan losses later in this section for further discussion 
noninterest income 
noninterest income increased by million from million in to million in the primary reason for the increase was the million gain on acquisition resulting from the fdic assisted bank of hiawassee acquisition 
table  which follows this discussion  presents a comparative analysis of the components of noninterest income 
service charges on deposit accounts increased primarily as a result of an increased number of demand deposit accounts resulting from the bank of hiawassee acquisition 
these accounts typically generate monthly service charges and non sufficient funds nsf fees on overdrafts 
however  legislation limiting the collection of nsf fees on debit card overdrafts for customers that do not opt in to our overdraft program began in july due to our efforts to encourage our customers to opt in to our overdraft program  the impact of this legislation has not had a significant negative impact on noninterest income 
mortgage banking income increased largely due to higher mortgage loan originations resulting from lower market interest rates  a reduced number of comp etitors  and the federal tax credit for first time home buyers which expired in april mortgage loan originations for purchases decreased after the expiration of this tax credit 
however originations for refinances increased due to lower market interest rates in commissions on sales of financial products increased due to an increased level of activity 
much of the company s level of activity is related to the performance of the stock market which was positive in income from bank owned life insurance increased due to the company transferring a portion of its policies to a higher yielding insurance product 
the decrease in the net gain on sale of investments  available for sale  was due to the sale of million of investment securities  available for sale 
these securities were sold primarily for the purpose of shortening the duration of the investment portfolio and reducing the adverse effects of risi ng interest rates on the company s equity position 
the increase in the net loss on sale of other assets was primarily related to losses incurred from the sale of million of other real estate 
given the company s increasing portfolio of other real estate owned  additional losses will likely be recognized from the disposal of its other real estate owned 
other noninterest income increased primarily as a result of higher safe deposit box rental fees  increased income from the operation of other real estate owned and higher dividends on fhlb stock 
noninterest expense 
the company s noninterest expense decreased by million from million in to million in the primary reason for the reduction was the million goodwill impairment charge that was taken in table  which follows this discussion  presents a comparative analysis of the components of noninterest expense 
in  the company recognized a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million which was the result of the company s annual goodwill impairment test 
in performing the impairment test  the company estimated the fair value of the reporting unit which was determined to be the company using a market value approach that utilizes the company s current stock price as the primary indicator of fair market value 
the results of the impairment test indicated that the million in outstanding goodwill was fully impaired and had a fair value of the primary factors in the determination of goodwill impairment were the relatively low stock price of the company and the resulting low market valuation 
these factors were largely attributed to the low market wide valuations f or financial institutions which impacted the company s market valuation 
compensation and benefits expense increased primarily as a result of the increased number of employees resulting from the bank of hiawassee acquisition 
the company has integrated the operations of the acquired bank and has reduced the number of its employment base through attrition and targeted layoffs as a result of the slowing economic conditions 
these reductions were largely focused in the areas related to commercial real estate due to the decreased originations in this area 
as economic conditions improve  the company will likely increase its number of employees which will increase future compensation expense 
occupancy and equipment expense increased due to the addition of five additional offices during in  the company plans to consolidate the operations of its leased facility in hiawassee  ga with an existing office in hiawassee  ga which should lower compensation expense  office occupancy and other noninterest expenses 
also in  we plan to relocate from an existing leased office in monroe  nc to a more conveniently located owned facility in monroe  nc 
the net effect of this move on our expenses is expected to be neutral 
office supplies increased due to higher expenses resulting from supplying five additional offices 
advertising and business development costs decreased slightly due to a reduced level of marketing during this period of economic slowdown 
as economic conditions improve  advertising and business development costs may increase 
professional services decreased slightly due to fees paid in related to the preparation and filing of regulatory documents in conjunction with a stock offering which was withdrawn due to unfavorable market conditions and fees paid in for restructuring a portion of the company s fhlb advances 
telephone and communications expenses increased due to the addition on five locations in data processing increased due to an increased number of customer accounts and software upgrades and enhancements 
the increase in the amortization of intangible assets was due to additional amortization expense related to the million core deposit intangible that was booked as a result of the bank of hiawassee acquisition 
this core deposit intangible is amortizing over an eight year period on an accelerated basis 
estimated amortization expense in is expected to be  deposit insurance increased primarily due to an increase in the amount of insured deposits  resulting from the acquisition of bank of hiawassee 
the company s fdic deposit insurance expense is not expected to increase materially in during the company recognized a million valuation adjustment on other real estate owned 
 this represented the decrease in the market value of real estate acquired by the company though foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure 
additional valuation adjustments on other real estate owned may be incurred in if real estate values continue to decrease 
in there were restructuring costs of million related to severance and other conversion related costs related to the bank of hiawassee acquisition 
no additional acquisition or restructuring costs related to this acquisition are expected for the impairment of investment securities in was primarily related to a  impairment on a million subordinated debt obligation that was determined to be other than temporary 
this investment was sold in the first quarter of for its adjusted book balance at december   so no further impairments will be incurred from this investment in other noninterest expense increased primarily due to higher costs relat ed to managing the company s other real estate owned portfolio 
these expenses include unpaid taxes  insurance  and maintenance 
income taxes 
the company recognized an income tax expense of million in compared to income tax benefit of million for the change in the tax provision was primarily due to a million increase in pretax income 
the effective tax rate increased from to due to the fact that the million goodwill impairment in was not an eligible deduction for income tax purposes 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and overview 
the company reported a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the primary reason for the loss in was the million goodwill impairment that was recognized as a result of the company s annual goodwill impairment evaluation testing 
net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between total interest income and total interest expense and is the company s principal source of earnings 
the company s net interest income increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  during the company experienced a one basis point increase in the net interest margin from for to for this increase in the net interest margin was caused in part by a basis point decrease in the company s average cost of funds from in to for the benefit from the lower c ost of funds was partly offset by a basis point decrease in the average yield on assets from in to in the lower average rates during were primarily due to a series of decreases in the federal funds rate by the federal reserve board during that resulted in a basis point decrease in the prime lending rate during the year from at the beginning of to at the end of at december   the company had approximately million in loans  or of the company s loan portfolio  repricing each month  the majority of which were tied to the prime lending rate 
also contributing to the net interest margin expansion was a million increase in the company s average interest earning assets from million in to million in however  average interest costing liabilities also increased by million from million in to million in which partly offset the effects of t he increase in average interest earning assets 
tables and following this discussion set forth certain information regarding the company s yield on interest earnings assets and cost of interest bearing liabilities for the respective periods ended december table details the company s average assets and average liabilities and the respective yield or cost of each of the components that are detailed 
changes in interest income and interest expense can result from changes in both volume and rates 
table sets forth information regarding changes in our interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated 
for each category of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to chang es in volume  which are changes in average volume multiplied by the average rate for the previous period  changes in rates which are changes in average rate multiplied by the average volume for the previous period  and changes in rate volume  which are allocated equally between rate and volume variances 
the total change is the sum of the previous columns 
interest income for the year ended december   decreased by million  or  to million 
interest income from loans decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was caused by a basis point decrease in the average yield on loans in to reflecting lower market interest rates in this decrease was partly offset by a million increase in the average balance for loans in to million 
interest earned on interest bearing bank balances decreased by  or  to  in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average yield of interest bearing bank balances to in however  the negative effects of this decrease in the average yield were partly offset by a million increase in the average balance in interest earned on investment securities decreased by  or  to million in this decrease in interest income on investment securities was due to an million  or  decrease in the average outstanding balance of investment securities to million in coupled with an basis point decrease in the average yield to for interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was largely due to a basis point decrease in the average cost of funds from in to in  reflecting lower market interest rates in interest expense on deposits decreased million  or  to million in this decrease was primarily due to a basis point decrease in the average cost of deposits to in  reflecting lower market interest rates in the positive impact of a decrease in the cost of deposits was partly offset by a million  or  increase in average deposits in average deposits increased due to organic growth generated from the company s primary market area 
interest paid on borrowed money decreased by  or  to million in average borrowings decreased by million  or  to million for  while the average rate paid on borrowings decreased by five basis points to for average borrowings decreased due to maturities that were funded by cash flow funds generated from deposit growth 
provision for loan losses 
the company provided million and million in loan loss provisions for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was at december   and at december  the provision for loan losses was increased due to an increase in nonperforming assets  coupled with net charge offs of million during in  the charlotte metropolitan area experienced decreases in housing prices  an increased unemployment rate  decreased housing starts and housing sales and decreased commercial activity 
however  the economic slowdown in the charlotte metropolitan area was generally been less severe than the economic slowdown experienced in other large metropolitan areas of the country 
due to the slowdown in the local economy  the level of nonperforming loans increased by million  to million at december  as a result  the ratio of nonperforming loans to gross loans increased from at december   to at december  also  other real estate owned increased by million to million at december  nonperforming assets increased by million to million at december   resulting in an increase in the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets from at december   to at december  refer to adequacy of allowance for loan losses later in this section for further discussion 
noninterest income 
noninterest income increased by million  or  from million in to million in table  which follows this discussion  presents a comparative analysis of the components of noninterest income 
service charges on deposit accounts increased primarily as a result of an increased number of demand deposit accounts which generate monthly service charges and non sufficient funds nsf fees on overdrafts 
however  recent legislation limiting the collection of nsf fees beginning in july will have an adverse impact on future fee income from deposit accounts 
mortgage banking income increased largely due to higher mortgage loan originations resulting from lower market interest rates  a reduced number of competitors  and the federal tax credit for first time home buyers 
this federal tax credit for first time home buyers expired in april and was expanded to include additional qualified home buyers 
mortgage loan originations could decrease after the expiration of this tax cr edit or in the event that market interest rates increase 
the increase in the net gain on sale of investments was due to the sale of million of investment securities 
these securities were sold primarily for the purpose of shortening the duration of the investment portfolio and reduce the adverse effects of rising interest rates on the company s equity position 
the company may continue to shorten the duration of its investment portfolio in  however  it is unlikely that there will be any material gains recognized from the sales of investments in the increase in the net loss on sale of other assets was primarily related to losses incurred from the sale of million of other real estate 
given the company s increasing portfolio of other real estate owned  additional losses will likely be recognized from the disposal of its other real estate owned 
commissions on sales of financial products decreased due to a reduced level of activity 
much of the company s level of activity is related to the performance of the stock market 
dividend income on fhlb stock decreased as the fhlb suspended most dividend payments during the fhlb reinstated its dividend payment to stockholders at the end of income from bank owned life insurance increased slightly due to the company transferring a portion of its policies to a higher yielding insurance product 
other noninterest income increased primarily as a result of a  increase from the fair value adjustment on deferred compensation assets 
this increase in the fair value adjustment on deferred compensation assets was offset by a corresponding decrease in compensation expense  resulting in no impact on net income 
noninterest expense 
the company s noninterest expense increased by million from million in to million in table  which follows this discussion  presents a comparative analysis of the components of noninterest expense 
the goodwill impairment charge of million was the result of the company s annual goodwill impairment test 
pursuant to accounting regulations  goodwill is evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis 
as such  the company performs its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year 
performing a goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
in performing the first step  the company estimated the fair value of the reporting unit which was determined to be the company using a market value approach that utilizes the company s current stock price as the primary indicator of fair market value 
the results of the first step indicated that the fair value of the company was less than the book value of the company 
as such  the company performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the results of the impairment test indicated that the million in outstanding goodwill was fully impaired and had a fair value of the primary factors in the determination of goodwill impairment were the relatively low stock price of the company and the resulting low market valuation 
these factors were largely attributed to the low market wide valuations for financial institutions which impacted the company s market valuation 
the goodwill impairment was a non cash expense and did not impact operating performance 
compensation and benefits expense decreased primarily as a result of a reduced number of employees 
the company reduced its employment base through attrition and targeted layoffs as a result of the slowing economic conditions 
these reductions were largely focused in the areas related to commercial real estate due to the decreased originations in this area 
occupancy expense decreased largely due to lower depreciation expense resulting from the complete depreciation of several large fixed assets related to the company s data processing 
office supplies decreased due to higher expenses incurred in related to opening a new office and improved pricing from a new supply vendor 
advertising cost decreased due to a reduced level of marketing during this economic slowdown 
professional fees increased primarily as a result of  in fees related to the preparation and filing of regulatory documents in conjunction with a stock offering which was withdrawn due to unfavorable market conditions 
also  the company paid  for restructuring a portion of its fhlb advances 
telephone expense increased slightly due to communication upgrades and the addition on a new location in data processing increased due to an increased number of customer accounts and software upgrades and enhancements 
the decrease in the amortization of intangible assets was due to the normal decrease associated with amortizing the core deposit intangible on an accelerated basis 
deposit insurance increased due to a  special assessment paid by the company in and an increase in the overall deposit assessment rate 
this special assessment and increase in the assessment rate was charged by the fdic to all insure d financial institutions as a result of depleted deposit reserve levels resulting from the increase number of bank failures during during the company recognized a  valuation adjustment on other real estate owned 
this represented the decrease in the market value of real estate acquired by the company though foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure 
in there were restructuring costs of  related to severance and other costs related to a realignment of the company s management structure 
there were no such charges in the impairment of investment securities in and was primarily related to a  impairment on a million trust preferred collateralized debt obligation that was determined to be other than temporary 
the book value of this investment was written down to  other noninterest expense increased primarily due to higher costs related to managing the comp any s other real estate owned portfolio 
these expenses include unpaid taxes  insurance  and maintenance 
income taxes 
the company recognized an income tax benefit of million in compared to income tax expense of  for the change in the tax provision was primarily due to a million decrease in pretax income 
the effective tax rate decreased from to due to a larger percentage of income being derived from tax advantaged assets such as municipal securities  us government agency securities  and bank owned life insurance that generate tax exempt income 
liquidity management the objectives of the company s liquidity management policy include providing adequate funds to meet the cash needs of both borrowers and depositors  to provide for the on going operations of the company  and to capitalize on opportunities for expansion 
liquidity management addresses the company s ability to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity  to repay borrowings as they mature  and to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise 
the primary sources of internally generated funds are principal and interest payments on loans receivable  increases in local deposits  cash flows generated from operations  and cash flows generated by investments 
if the company requires funds beyond its internal funding capabilities  it may rely upon external sources of funds such as brokered deposits and borrowings  including fhlb advances 
at december   the bank had approximately million in additional borrowings available from its line of credit from the fhlb 
the fhlb functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions 
as a member of the fhlb  we are required to own capital stock in the fhlb and we are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets principally securities that are obligations of  or guaranteed by  the us government provided certain creditworthiness standards have been met 
advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs 
each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
depending on the program  limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit 
in addition  th e bank maintains a million unsecured fed funds line of credit with pacific coast bankers bank and a million unsecured fed funds line of credit with centerstate bank of florida 
as of december   the balance on both of the fed funds lines of credit was the company may also solicit brokered deposits for providing funds for asset growth 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of business  various commitments are outstanding that are not reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
commitments to extend credit and undisbursed advances on customer lines of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
the funding of these commitments and previously approved undisbursed lines of credit could affect the company liquidity position 
the company does not have any special purpose entities or other similar forms of off balance sheet financing 
table  which follows this discussion  deta ils the company s off balance sheet commitments at december  and december  contractual obligations 
under existing contractual obligations  the company will be required to make payments in future periods 
the company expects that a portion of the deposits will not be renewed upon maturity 
if there is a higher than normal level of time deposits that are not renewed at maturity  then the company may experience a decrease in liquidity 
this may result in the company offering higher than market interest rates to maintain deposits  which would increase interest expense 
transaction deposit accounts with indeterminate maturities have been classified as having payments due in one year or less 
table following this discussion presents aggregated information about payments due under such contractual obligations at december  capital resources funding for future growth is largely dependent upon the earnings of the company and its subsidiaries 
at december   the company had a capital to assets ratio of 
as such  the company fully expects to be able to meet future capital needs caused by growth and expansion as well as regulatory requirements 
bank regulatory capital 
ots regulations require savings banks to meet three minimum capital standards a tangible capital ratio  a leverage ratio and an risk based capital ratio 
at december   citizens south bank s capital exceeded all applicable requirements 
under prompt corrective action regulations  the ots is required and authorized to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings banks 
for this purpose  a savings bank is placed in one of the following five categories based on the bank s capital well capitalized at least leverage capital  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital  adequately capitalized at least leverage capital  tier risk based capital and to tal risk based capital  undercapitalized less than total risk based capital  tier risk based capital or leverage capital  significantly undercapitalized less than total risk based capital  tier risk based capital or leverage capital  and critically undercapitalized less than tangible capital 
at december   citizens south bank met the criteria for being considered well capitalized 
preferred stock 
on december   citizens south banking corporation entered into a letter agreement the purchase agreement with the united states department of the treasury us treasury pursuant to which the company has issued and sold to the us treasury i  shares of the company fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a  par value per share the series a preferred stock  having a liquidation amount per share equal to  for a total price of  and ii a warrant to purchase  shares of the company common stock  par value per share  at an exercise price per share of  adjusted for stock dividends 
the series a preferred stock pays cumulative dividends at a rate of p er annum for the first five years and thereafter at a rate of per annum 
after three years  the company may  at its option  redeem the series a preferred stock at the liquidation amount plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
the series a preferred stock is generally non voting 
prior to december   and unless the company has redeemed all of the series a preferred stock or the us treasury has transferred all of the series a preferred stock to a third party  the approval of the us treasury will be required for the company to increase its common stock dividend or repurchase its common stock or other equity or capital securities  other than in certain circumstances specified in the purchase agreement 
the warrant has a ten year term and is immediately exercisable 
the warrant provides for the adjustment of the exercise price and the number of shares of the company common stock issuable upon exercise pursuant to customary anti dilution provisions  such as upon stock splits or distributions of securities or other assets to holders of the company common stock  and upon certain issuances of the company common stock at or below a specified price relative to the then current market price of the company common stock 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  the us treasury has agreed not to exercise voting power with respect to any shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the warrant 
both the series a preferred stock and warrant will be accounted for as components of tier capital 
the series a preferred stock and the warrant were issued in a private placement exempt from registration pursuant to section of the securities act of  as amended 
the company has agreed to register for resale the series a preferred stock  the warrant and the shares of common stock underlying the warrant if and when requested to do so in writing by the us treasury 
neither the series a preferred stock nor the warrant will be subject to any contractual restrictions on transfer 
the us treasury also placed certain restrictions on the amount and type of compensation that can be paid to certain senior level executives of the company 
lending activities loan types 
the company originates a variety of loans including residential mortgage loans  commercial real estate loans  commercial business loans  and consumer loans within its market area 
a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate  either as primary or secondary collateral  located in our primary market area 
the company has a diversified loan portfolio with no material concentrations to any one borrower or industry 
the company has not been an originator or purchaser of option adjustable rate or no documentation portfolio loans and the company s loan portfolio does not include any mortgage loans that are considered sub prim e  which are generally considered loans made to borrowers with lower credit ratings resulting from a poor payment history 
the company continues to solicit owner occupied commercial real estate loans  residential real estate loans  business loans  and consumer loans to customers located in the company s primary lending area 
the company originates and closes a large portion of all new one to four family residential loans as a broker for independent third parties on a servicing released basis 
this generates additional fee income and reduces the potential adverse effects of rising interest rates on the company s future earnings that normally result from holding long term fixed rate loans 
in general  the company retains in its portfolio residential loans that have an adjustable interest rate or are jumbo loans that are not marketable in the secondary market 
these loans are underwritten to the fully indexed rate and typically have a loan to value ratio of or less 
management expects that in the company s portfolio of one to four family mortgage loans will continue to increase from its current level as a number of competitors have exited this business sector due to the housing slowdown 
in addition  mortgage loan interest rates have become more attractive for borrowers  thus increasing opportunities for customers to refinance their existing mortgage loans 
the company does not service loans for the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or federal national mortgage association fannie mae 
table  which follows this discussion  details the amounts and types of loans outstanding over the past five years ended december table  which follows this discussion  segregates the maturity distribution of the company loans by type and interest rate type as of december  demand loans  loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity  and overdrafts are reported as becoming due within one year 
loan balances do not include undisbursed loan proceeds  unearned discounts  unearned income and allowance for loan losses 
scheduled contractual principal repayments of loans do not reflect the actual life of such assets 
the average life of a loan is substantially less than its contractual terms because of prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses on loans generally give us the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase  however  when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decrease when rates on existing mortgage loans are substantially higher than current mortgage loan market rates 
lending policies 
our lending activities are subject to the written  non discriminatory  underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by management and approved annually by our board of directors 
our board of directors must approve all loans in excess of million  or in any amount to borrowers with existing exposure to us in excess of million  or in any amount that when added to the borrower s existing exposure to us causes such total exposure to be in excess of million 
in addition  all unsecured loans in excess of  or in any amount that when added to a borrower s existing unsecured exposure to us causes such unsecured exposure to be in excess of  must be approved by our board of directors 
loans of million or less  or customers with exposure including the proposed loan of million or less  or unsecured loans of  or less  or customers with unsecured exposure including the proposed loan of  or less  as applicable  may be approved individually or jointly by our lending officers within loan approval limits delegated by our board of directors 
in addition  the board of directors has delegated incremental loan approval limits to certain officers which allow them to approve a new loan to an existing customer in an amount equal to  or less than  their incremental loan limit that would otherwise require approval by the board of directors or the additional approval of another lending officer 
any loan approved by a lending officer using their incremental loan limit must be ratified by the board of directors  or approved by another lending officer  as applicable  after the loan has been made 
lending practices are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that underwriting policies are consistently applied 
loan originations come from a number of sources including real estate agents  home builders  walk in customers  referrals and existing customers 
loan officers also call on local businesses soliciting commercial products 
we advertise our loan products in various print media including local newspapers as well as the company s website 
in our marketing materials  we emphasize our community ties  personalized customer service  and an efficient underwriting and approval process 
all real estate collateral is either evaluated or appraised by an independent certified appraiser in accordance with regulatory requirements 
on new loan originations  we require hazard  title and  to the ext ent applicable  flood insurance on all securitized property 
approximately million  or  of our consumer loans were home equity loans and lines of credit secured by a second lien on residential properties 
these loans typically have a loan to value ratio of or less including any senior liens and are generally secured by owner occupied residential properties located in the company s primary lending area 
management plans to continue to grow its consumer loan portfolio in by continuing an incentive plan for its retail branch managers 
however  due to declining housing prices  management has lowered the loan to value ratio on new home equity lines of credit to 
commercial business loans increased by million  or  to million at december  management expects moderate growth of its com mercial business loans in given the current economic conditions 
asset quality nonperforming assets and delinquencies 
when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan  we attempt to cure the deficiency by contacting the borrower and collecting the payment 
computer generated late notices are mailed days after a payment is due 
in most cases  deficiencies are cured promptly 
if a delinquency continues  additional contact is made either through a notice or other means and we will attempt to work out a payment schedule and actively encourage delinquent residential mortgage borrowers to seek home ownership counseling 
while we generally prefer to work with borrowers to resolve such problems  we will institute foreclosure or other proceedings  as necessary  to minimize any potential loss 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status if  in the opinion of management  principal and or interest payments are not likely to be paid in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement  such as when principal or interest is past due days or more 
interest accrued but not collected at the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against income in the current period 
loans may be reinstated to accrual status when payments have been made to bring the account under days past due or  in the opinion of management  collection of the remaining past due balances can be reasonably expected 
our board of directors is informed monthly of the total amount of loans which are more than days delinquent 
loans that are more than days delinquent or in foreclosure are reviewed by the board on an individual basis each month 
table following this discussion sets forth information with respect to our nonperforming assets at december for the past f ive years 
restructured loans 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we are required to account for certain loan modifications or restructurings as troubled debt restructurings 
in general  the modification or restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring if we  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties  grant a concession to the borrowers that we would not otherwise consider 
debt restructurings or loan modifications for a borrower do not necessarily always constitute troubled debt restructurings 
also  troubled debt restructurings do not necessarily result in an increase in nonaccrual loans 
as of december   we had restr uctured loans totaling million 
of this amount  million were covered by fdic loss share agreements  million were on non accrual status  and million were current and accruing 
restructured loans totaled million at december   million at december   million at december   and million at december  asset classification 
the ots has adopted various regulations regarding problem assets of financial institutions 
the regulations require that each insured institution review and classify its assets on a regular basis 
in addition  in connection with examinations of insured institutions  ots examiners have the authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
there are three classifications for problem assets substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss  we establish specific allowances for loan losses for the full amount of the portion of the asset classified as loss 
all or a portion of general loan loss allowances established to cover possible losses related to assets classified substandard or doubtful can be included in determining an institution s regulatory capital  while specific valuation allowances for loan losses generally do not qualify as regulatory capital 
assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated special mention 
as of december   we had million of non covered assets classified as substandard   of non covered assets classified as doubtful and no loans classified as loss 
the amount of non covered assets designated special mention as of december   was million 
management determined that there were impaired loans totaling million as of december  based on an analysis of the underlying collateral of the loans  the overall economic conditions  discussions with the borrowers  and the historical performance of the loan  management created specific reserves totaling  for these impaired loans and partial charge offs totaling million 
as of december   we had million of assets classified as substandard   of assets classified as doubtful and no loans classified as loss 
the aggregate amount designated special mention as of december   was million 
management determined that there were impaired loans totaling million as of december  based on an analysis of the underlying collateral of the loans  the overall economic conditions  discussions with the borrowers  and the historical performance of the loan  management created specific reserves totaling million for these impaired loans 
analysis of allowance for loan losses management has established a systematic methodology for evaluating the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses 
the methodology is set forth in a formal policy and considers all loans in the portfolio 
specific allowances are established for certain individual loans that management considers impaired 
the remainder of the portfolio is segmented into groups of loans with similar risk characteristics for evaluation and analysis 
in originating loans  we recognize that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower  the term of the loan  general economic conditions  and in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the collat eral 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for loan losses against our current period income 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is consistently applied and is based on our past loan loss experience  particular risks inherent in the different kinds of lending that we engage in  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions  and other relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability 
at december   we had an allowance for loan losses of million compared to million at december  management believes that the current allowance meets the requirement for losses on loans that management considers to be impaired  for known losses  and for risks inherent in the remaining loan portfolios 
although management believes that it uses the best information available to make such determinations  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be significantly adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
the allowance for loan losses is subject to periodic evaluation by various regulatory authorities and may be subject to adjustment upon their examination 
table following this discussion sets forth an analysis of our allowance for loan losses as of december of the respective five year periods 
table  which follows this discussion  sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at december for the five years indicated 
management believes that the allowance can be allocated by category only on an approximate basis 
the allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any other category 
investment securities the company primarily invests in us treasury and agency obligations  municipal bonds  mortgage backed securities issued by government sponsor entities  investment grade corporate bonds  and other miscellaneous securities 
each investment in our portfolio was classified as either available for sale or held to maturity on the date of purchase 
investment securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of consolidated shareholders equity and as an item of other comprehensive income 
investment securities classified as held to maturity are carried at book value 
table  which follows this discussion  details the company s portfolio of investment securities 
deposits our deposit products include a broad selection of deposit instruments  including checking accounts  money market deposit accounts  savings accounts  individual retirement accounts  and term certificate accounts 
we offer these products to both retail and commercial customers 
deposit account terms vary with the principal difference being the minimum balance deposit  early withdrawal penalties and the interest rate 
we review our deposit mix and pricing weekly 
we believe that we are competitive in the type of accounts and interest rates we offer on our deposit products 
we do not seek to pay the highest deposit rates  but a competitive rate 
management determines the rates paid based on a number of conditions  including rates paid by competitors  rates on us treasury securities  rates offered on alternativ e lending programs  and the deposit growth rate we are seeking to achieve 
table following this discussion sets forth information concerning our deposit accounts over the past three years as of december table indicates the amount of our time deposits with a principal balance of  or more by time remaining until maturity 
borrowed money borrowed money provides an additional source of funding for the company to cover new loan growth  repay maturing deposits  purchase investment securities  or other operating purposes 
the company s borrowed money includes unsecured federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks  secured lines of credit with the federal home loan bank of atlanta  reverse repurchase agreements with other financial institutions and subordinated debt 
the interest rates on borrowed money ranged from to in and from to in the highest outstanding balance for borrowed money was million in and million in see table following this discussion for a breakdown of the company s borrowed money as of december  and impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the effect of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily change in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
quarterly financial information table  following this discussion  sets forth certain consolidated quarterly financial information 
this information is derived from unaudited financial statements  which include  in the opinion of management  all normal recurring adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such periods 
this information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of market risk market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the risk of loss can be reflected in diminished market values and or reduced net interest income in future periods 
the company s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk  as the majority of the company assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the structure of the company loan and deposit portfolios is such that significant changes in interest rates could adversely impact net interest income 
the company does not maintain a trading account  nor is it subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
the company asset liability committee alco is responsible for monitoring and managing exposure to interest rate risk 
the company alco monitors the company level of interest rate sensitivity and ensures that the level of sensitivity of the company net portfolio value is maintained within limits established by the board of directors 
through such management  the alco seeks to reduce the vulnerability of the company operations to changes in interest rates 
during the past year  the alco utilized the following strategies to manage interest rate risk emphasizing the origination and retention of short term commercial business loans and nonresidential mortgage loans  emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate home equity lines of credit  emphasizing the origination and retention of adjustable rate one to four family residential mortgage loans  originating all new fixed rate mortgage loans as a broker for a third party  and focusing on growing the company s core deposit portfolio 
interest rate sensitivity 
the ots requires the computation of amounts by which the net present value of the bank cash flow from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items the bank s net portfolio value or npv and the net interest income nii of the bank would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
these computations estimate the effect on a bank s npv and nii from instantaneous and permanent one hundred to three hundred basis point increases and decreases in market interest rates 
table  which follows this discussion  presents the bank s projected change in npv and nii at december   as calculated by an indepen dent third party  based upon information provided by the bank 
this table also details the bank s level of sensitivity  given a hypothetical  immediate  and sustained change in interest rates from basis points to basis points  and its range of acceptable sensitivity established by the board of directors 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes in npv require the making of certain assumptions  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv presented in table assumes that the composition of the interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv on table provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results
