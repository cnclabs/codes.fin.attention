table of contents in response to our evaluations and the reactions of our guests  we have made and expect to continue to make enhancements and refinements to this resort complex 
future development approximately acres of land comprising wynn las vegas and encore at wynn las vegas is currently improved with a golf course 
while we may develop this property in the future  we have no immediate plans to do so 
we have applied to the government of macau for a land concession on approximately aces of land on cotai and are awaiting final government approval on the concession 
no construction timeline or budget has yet been developed 
results of operations our operating results in macau were strong during  however  reduced levels of consumer spending  high unemployment and increased hotel supply in the las vegas market have and may continue to adversely impact our financial results in las vegas 
our results for the years presented are not comparable as the year ended december  includes the operations of encore at wynn macau which opened on april  our results for the year ended december   includes encore at wynn las vegas for a full year  whereas included only days of operations for encore at wynn las vegas 
our net revenues for the years ended december   and amounts in thousands are as follows for the years ended december  net revenues las vegas operations macau operations total net revenues reliance on only two resort complexes in two geographic regions for our operating cash flow exposes us to certain risks that competitors  whose operations are more diversified  may be better able to control 
in addition to the concentration of operations in two resort complexes  many of our customers are high end gaming customers who wager on credit  thus exposing us to increased credit risk 
high end gaming also increases the potential for variability in our results 
operating measures certain key operating statistics specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which a consolidated statement of income is presented 
there are two methods used to calculate win percentage in the casino industry 
in las vegas and in the general casino in macau  customers primarily purchase gaming chips from gaming tables 
the cash and net markers used to purchase the gaming chips from gaming tables are deposited in the gaming table s drop box 
this is the base of measurement that we use in the casino at our las vegas operations and in the general casino at our macau operations for calculating win percentage 
in our vip casino in macau  customers primarily purchase non negotiable rolling chips from the casino cage and there is no deposit into a gaming table drop box from chips purchased from the cage 
non negotiable chips can only be used to make wagers 
winning wagers are paid in cash chips 
the loss of the non negotiable rolling 
table of contents chips in the vip casino is recorded as turnover and provides a base for measuring vip casino win percentage 
because of this difference in chip purchase activity  the measurement base used in the general casino is not the same that is used in the vip casino 
it is customary in macau to measure vip casino play using this rolling chip method 
the measurement method in las vegas and in the general casino in macau effectively tracks the initial purchase of chips while the measurement method in the vip casino at wynn macau effectively tracks the sum of all losing wagers 
accordingly  the base measurement in the vip casino is much larger than the general casino 
as a result  the expected win percent with the same amount of gaming win numerator is smaller in the vip casino in macau when compared to the general casino in las vegas and macau 
even though both use the same measurement method  we experience different win percentages in the general casino activity in las vegas versus macau 
this difference is primarily due to the difference in the mix of table games between the two casinos 
each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage 
the life to date table games win percentage for our las vegas operations is whereas the life to date table games win percentage for the general casino at our macau operations is 
below are definitions of the statistics discussed table games win is the amount of drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenue 
drop is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table s drop box 
turnover is the sum of all losing rolling chip wagers within our macau vip program 
rolling chips are identifiable chips that are used to track vip wagering volume turnover for purposes of calculating incentives 
slot win is the amount of handle representing the total amount wagered that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenue 
average daily rate adr is calculated by dividing total room revenue less service charges  if any by total rooms occupied 
revenue per available room revpar is calculated by dividing total room revenue less service charges  if any by total rooms available 
financial results for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues net revenues for the year ended december  are comprised of  million in casino revenues of total net revenues and million of net non casino revenues of total net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended december  were comprised of  million in casino revenues of total net revenues and million of net non casino revenues of total net revenues 
casino revenues are comprised of the net win from our table games and slot machine operations 
casino revenues for the year ended december  of approximately  million represents a  million or increase from casino revenues of  million for the year ended december  our las vegas operations experienced a million increase in casino revenues compared to the prior year due to a increase in drop and an increase in our average table games win percentage 
our average table games win percentage before discounts for the year ended december  was which was within the expected range of to and compares to for the prior year 
slot handle at our las vegas operations decreased compared to the prior year  however slot win decreased only as more play shifted to higher hold machines 

table of contents casino revenues at our macau operations increased  million during the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
we experienced a increase in the vip revenue segment due to a increase in turnover 
our win as a percent of turnover was  which is at the high end of the expected range of to  and compares to in the prior year 
in november we added two new private gaming salons with vip tables and on april  we added vip tables with the opening of encore at wynn macau  which helped drive some of the growth in our vip segment during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
our vip casino segment win as a percent of turnover includes a nominal beneficial effect attributable to non rolling chip play 
in our general casino  drop increased when compared to the prior year and the average table games win percentage was  which is above the expected range of to 
the average table game win percentage for the year ended december  was 
slot handle increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the opening of encore at wynn macau and slot win increased by 
for the year ended december   room revenues were approximately million  an increase of million compared to prior year room revenue of million 
room revenue at our las vegas operations decreased approximately million compared to the prior year 
in las vegas  we continued to experience a decrease in room rates during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  we believe this is due to the current economic conditions in which we operate in the us and the increased capacity in the las vegas market including the opening of a new large scale casino hotel in las vegas in december in addition  in july  we commenced a project to remodel all of the rooms at wynn las vegas 
accordingly  we had fewer room nights available during the year ended december  which had a negative impact on our room revenues in las vegas 
this room remodel is expected to be completed in the second quarter of room revenue at our macau operations increased approximately million due to the additional suites added with encore at wynn macau and an increase in the average daily room rate compared to the prior year 
the table below sets forth key operating measures related to room revenue 
year ended december  average daily rate las vegas macau occupancy las vegas macau revpar las vegas macau other non casino revenues for the year ended december  included food and beverage revenues of approximately million  retail revenues of approximately million  entertainment revenues of approximately million  and other revenues from outlets such as the spa and salon  of approximately million 
other non casino revenues for the year ended december  included food and beverage revenues of approximately million  retail revenues of approximately million  entertainment revenues of approximately million  and other revenues from outlets  including the spa and salon  of approximately million 
food and beverage revenues at our las vegas operations increased approximately million  while our macau operations increased million  as compared to the prior year 
the increase in las vegas is due primarily to business in our nightclubs including the opening of the encore beach club and surrender nightclub in may the increase in macau is primarily due to the opening of encore at wynn macau and increased visitation to our resort 
retail revenues at our macau operations increased million  offset by a 
table of contents decrease of million in las vegas 
the increase in macau is due primarily to increased sales at several outlets  the opening of wynn and co 
watches and jewelry in november  which sells cartier and jaeger le coultre products  and new outlets at encore at wynn macau including chanel  piaget and cartier 
entertainment revenues increased over the prior year primarily due to performances by garth brooks in the encore theater in las vegas which commenced in december  as well as increased revenue from our le r ve show 
departmental  administrative and other expenses during the year ended december   departmental expenses included casino expenses of  million  room expenses of million  food and beverage expenses of million  and entertainment  retail and other expenses of million

during the year ended december   departmental expenses included casino expenses of  million  room expenses of million  food and beverage expenses of million  and entertainment  retail and other expenses of million 
also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately million and approximately million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable 
casino expenses have increased during the year ended december  due primarily to an increase in casino revenues especially at our macau operations where we incur a gaming tax and other levies at a rate totaling in accordance with our concession agreement 
room expenses increased during the year ended december   compared to the prior year  primarily due to increased customer acquisition and marketing costs and the opening of encore at wynn macau in april food and beverage expenses increased commensurate with the increase in revenue 
entertainment  retail and other expense increased primarily as a result of performances by garth brooks in the encore theater at wynn las vegas and increased retail sales in macau as noted above 
general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher spending associated with corporate activities 
the provision for doubtful accounts receivable increased million due to an increase in credit issuances commensurate with the increase in business volume 
pre opening costs during the year ended december   we incurred million of pre opening costs compared to million during the year ended december  pre opening costs incurred during the year ended december   primarily related to encore at wynn macau which opened on april  and the encore beach club which opened in las vegas on may  depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to assets with a year life being fully depreciated as of april at wynn las vegas  offset by depreciation of the assets of encore at wynn macau which were placed in to service in april and the assets of the encore beach club which were placed in to service in may during the construction of our resorts  costs incurred in the construction of the buildings  improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized 
once these resorts opened  their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense 
depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets 
in addition  we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment  intangibles and other assets and adjust them when warranted 
the maximum useful life of assets at our macau operations is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession  which currently expire in june and august  respectively 
consequently  depreciation related to our macau operations is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to our las vegas operations 

table of contents property charges and other property charges and other generally include costs related to the retirement of assets for remodels and asset abandonments 
property charges and other for the year ended december   were million compared to million for the year ended december  property charges and other for the year ended december  include a contract termination payment of million related to a management contract for certain of the nightclubs at wynn las vegas and encore at wynn las vegas and miscellaneous renovations  abandonments and gain loss on sale of equipment at wynn las vegas and wynn macau

in response to our evaluation of our resorts and the reactions of our guests  we continue to remodel and make enhancements at our resorts 
other non operating costs and expenses interest income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during and  our short term investment strategy has been to preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity 
accordingly  our short term investments include primarily money market funds  us treasury bills and time deposits with a purchase maturity of three months or less 
interest expense was million  net of capitalized interest of million  for the year ended december   compared to million  net of capitalized interest of million  for the year ended december  our interest expense increased approximately million primarily due to i an increase of million related to the wynn las vegas million first mortgage notes issued in october  ii an increase of million related to the increase in rate for the wynn las vegas first mortgage notes as discussed below  and iii a decrease in interest capitalized of million 
these increases were offset partially by i a decrease of million due to the payoff of the wynn resorts term loan in june and ii a decrease of million related to reduced amounts outstanding under the wynn las vegas and wynn macau bank revolving credit facilities compared to the prior year 
changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as an increase or decrease in swap fair value in each year

in connection with that exchange offer  the direct costs incurred with third parties of million were expensed 
also  in connection with our july tender offer for the then outstanding notes and subsequent call of all the remaining amounts once the tender was completed  we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of million

during this same period  we purchased million face amount of the 
table of contents notes through open market purchases at a discount 
this transaction resulted in a gain on early extinguishment of debt of million  net of the write off of unamortized debt discount and debt issue costs 
we participated in the april tender offer noted above with respect to million of these notes and accordingly  as of december   wynn resorts holds million of this debt which has not been contributed to its wholly owned subsidiary  wynn las vegas 
for accounting purposes these notes were treated as having been extinguished by wynn resorts in in october  we purchased loans through an offer to purchase loans outstanding under the wynn las vegas credit agreement  with a face value of million for million  reflecting a discounted price of 
in connection with this transaction  we recognized a net gain of approximately million on early retirement of debt 
offsetting these gains was the write off of debt issue costs of approximately million related to permanent reductions in our bank credit facility as described under financing activities below 
income taxes during the year ended december   we recorded a tax expense of million 
our provision for income taxes is primarily comprised of increases in our foreign and domestic valuation allowances relating to foreign tax loss carryforwards  other foreign deferred tax assets and us foreign tax credits not considered more likely than not realizable in the future 
the tax provision recorded for the valuation allowance increases was reduced by an income tax benefit recorded for the loss from our us operations 
as of june   we no longer consider our portion of the tax earnings and profits of wynn macau  limited to be permanently reinvested 
no additional us tax provision has been made with respect to this amount as we anticipate that us foreign tax credits should be sufficient to eliminate any us tax provision relating to such repatriation 
prior to this change  our earnings attributable to periods after september  were considered permanently reinvested abroad 
the decrease in our current deferred tax liability is primarily attributable to the repatriation of billion of wynn macau  limited ipo proceeds not considered permanently reinvested

as of december   no significant issues have been brought to our attention and we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions recorded at wynn macau sa is adequate with respect to these years 
during  we reached an agreement with the appellate division of the irs regarding issues raised during the examination of our and us income tax returns 
the issues for consideration by the appellate division were temporary differences and related to the deduction of certain costs incurred during the development and construction of wynn las vegas and the appropriate tax depreciation recovery periods applicable to certain assets 
as a result of this settlement with the appellate division  we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by million 
this reduction in unrecognized tax benefits resulted in a decrease in our liability for uncertain tax positions of million 
the settlement of the and examination issues did not result in a cash tax payment but rather utilized million and million in foreign tax credit and general business credit carryforwards

income taxes during the year ended december   we recorded a tax expense of million 
our provision for income taxes primarily relates to an increase in a valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits resulting from the repatriation of wynn macau earnings and the wynn macau limited ipo proceeds 
as discussed in our footnote on income taxes note  we currently do not consider forecasted future operating results when scheduling the realization of deferred tax assets and the required valuation allowance but instead rely solely on the reversal of net taxable temporary differences 
the ultimate realization of our recorded foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is dependent upon the incurrence of sufficient us income tax liabilities attributable to foreign source income during the year foreign tax credit carryover period 
as of december   we have provided deferred income taxes net of foreign tax credits on the wynn macau limited ipo proceeds note planned for repatriation 
no deferred income taxes have been provided for earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are considered permanently reinvested

in january  the irs commenced an examination of the company s   and us federal income tax returns 
during the year ended december   we received the results of an irs examination of our and tax returns and we filed an appeal of the examination s findings 
in connection with that appeal  we agreed to extend the statute of limitations for our and tax returns to march  we do not expect resolution of the findings within months 
we believe that our liabilities for uncertain tax positions related to the examination s findings are adequate 
the resolution of the and irs examination is not expected to result in any significant cash payment  but rather the utilization of a portion of our foreign tax credit carryforward

table of contents adjusted property ebitda adjusted property ebitda is used by us to manage the operating results of our segments 
adjusted property ebitda is earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  pre opening costs  property charges and other  corporate expenses  stock based compensation  and other non operating income and expenses  and includes equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates 
adjusted property ebitda is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because we believe that it is widely used to measure the performance  and as a basis for valuation  of gaming companies 
we use adjusted property ebitda as a measure of the operating performance of our segments and to compare the operating performance of our properties with those of our competitors 
we also present adjusted property ebitda because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a company s ability to incur and service debt  make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements 
gaming companies have historically reported ebitda as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand alone basis  gaming companies  including us  have historically excluded from their ebitda calculations pre opening expenses  property charges and corporate expenses that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties 
however  adjusted property ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance  as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity  or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
unlike net income  adjusted property ebitda does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital 
we have significant uses of cash flows  including capital expenditures  interest payments  debt principal repayments  taxes and other non recurring charges  which are not reflected in adjusted property ebitda 
also  our calculation of adjusted property ebitda may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and  therefore  comparability may be limited 
the following table summarizes adjusted property ebitda for our domestic wynn las vegas and foreign wynn macau operations as reviewed by management and summarized in item notes to consolidated financial statement note segment information 
that footnote also presents a reconciliation of adjusted property ebitda to net income 
years ended december  las vegas macau total adjusted property ebitda during the past three years we have experienced disparity between our domestic las vegas and our foreign macau operations 
adjusted property ebitda has grown at our macau operations  while we have experienced little variance in las vegas 
this disparity is a direct result of the factors that have impacted the global economy  especially the united states 
demand in las vegas has been flat while demand in macau has steadily increased 
during  the economic environment in the gaming and hotel markets in las vegas continued to experience depressed levels of gaming revenue  visitation and hotel room demand 
while certain gaming and hotel statistics have increased from levels  improvement has not been significant 
the average daily room rate increased  visitation increased to million visitors  and las vegas strip gaming revenues increased  all as compared to the year ended december  during  the economic environment in the gaming and hotel markets in las vegas experienced declines including among other things  a decrease in visitation  a decrease in las vegas strip gaming revenue and a decrease in average daily room rates  all as compared to the year ended december  while our customers in the united states have greatly reduced their spending levels due to weakness in the overall economy  increases in unemployment and weak consumer confidence  our customer base in macau has not been impacted as much by such economic factors 

table of contents also contributing to this decrease in the wynn las vegas adjusted property ebitda from to was the opening of encore at wynn las vegas in december while we added significant capacity to our las vegas operations  we experienced a relatively small increase in revenues due to the factors noted herein  but we also incurred significant additional operating expenses 
our macau adjusted property ebitda has increased as that market continues to grow and as we have expanded our resort 
revenues in declined slightly  however our operating expenses decreased at a greater rate due primarily to cost savings initiatives implemented during refer to the discussions above regarding the specific details of our results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations our operating cash flows primarily consist of our operating income generated by our las vegas and macau resorts excluding depreciation and other non cash charges  interest paid  and changes in working capital accounts such as receivables  inventories  prepaid expenses  and payables 
our table games play both in macau and las vegas is a mix of cash play and credit play  while our slot machine play is conducted primarily on a cash basis 
a significant portion of our table games revenue is attributable to the play of a limited number of high end international customers that gamble on credit 
the ability to collect these gaming receivables may impact our operating cash flow for the period 
our rooms  food and beverage  and entertainment  retail  and other revenue is conducted primarily on a cash basis or as a trade receivable 
accordingly  operating cash flows will be impacted by changes in operating income and accounts receivables 
net cash provided from operations for the year ended december  was billion compared to million provided by operations for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the increase in operating income as a result of increased casino  food and beverage  entertainment  retail and other department profitability especially from our macau casino operations as discussed above 
cash flow from operations also benefited from a reduction in cash paid for interest and an increase from ordinary working capital changes 
capital resources we require a certain amount of cash on hand for operations 
at december   we had approximately billion of cash and cash equivalents available for operations  debt service and retirement  development activities  general corporate purposes and enhancements to our resorts 
approximately million of our cash balance is held by wynn resorts  limited  which is not a guarantor of the debt of its subsidiaries  including wynn las vegas  llc  wynn las vegas capital corp 
and wynn macau  sa in addition  as of december   we had approximately million of availability under our wynn las vegas revolving credit facility and approximately million of availability under our wynn macau senior revolving credit facility 
debt maturities in are million  excluding million of the wynn macau term loan that we have presented as a long term liability as we have both the intent and ability to refinance this maturity with borrowings under the wynn macau revolver 
we believe that cash flow from operations  availability under our bank credit facilities and our existing cash balances will be adequate to satisfy our anticipated uses of capital during if any additional financing became necessary  we cannot provide assurance that future borrowings will be available 
cash and cash equivalents include investments in money market funds  us treasury bills and bank time deposits  all with maturities of less than days 
investing activities capital expenditures were approximately million  million and billion for the years ended december   and our capital expenditures relate primarily to the construction cost associated with encore at wynn macau  which opened in april  the encore beach club and surrender nightclub  which opened in may and encore at wynn las vegas  which opened in december
