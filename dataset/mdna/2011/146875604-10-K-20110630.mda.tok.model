the holding company is headquartered in new york  new york 
the holding company conducts business as a unitary savings and loan holding company  and the principal business of the holding company consists of the operation of its wholly owned subsidiary  carver federal 
carver federal was founded in to serve african american communities whose residents  businesses and institutions had limited access to mainstream financial services 
the bank remains headquartered in harlem  and predominantly all its nine branches and nine stand alone atm centers are located in low to moderate income neighborhoods 
many of these historically underserved communities have experienced unprecedented growth and diversification of incomes  ethnicity and economic opportunity  after decades of public and private investment 
carver federal is the largest african american operated bank in the united states 
the bank remains dedicated to expanding wealth enhancing opportunities in the communities it serves by increasing access to capital and other financial services for consumers  businesses and non profit organizations  including faith based institutions 
a measure of its progress in achieving this goal includes the bank outstanding rating  awarded by the office of thrift supervision following its most recent community reinvestment act cra examination in the examination report noted that of carver community development lending and of carver home owners mortgage disclosure act hmda reportable loan originations were within low to moderate income geographies  which far exceeded peer institutions

the neighborhoods in which the bank branches are located have historically been low to moderate income areas 
the bank primary lending market includes bronx  kings  new york and queens counties in new york city  and lower westchester county  new york 
although the bank branches are primarily located in areas that were historically underserved by other financial institutions  the bank faces significant competition for deposits and mortgage lending in its market areas 
management believes that this competition had become more intense as a result of increased examination emphasis by federal banking regulators on financial institutions fulfillment of their responsibilities under the cra and more recently due to the decline in demand for loans by qualified borrowers 
carver federal market area has a high density of financial institutions  many of which have greater financial resources  name recognition and market presence  and all of which are competitors to varying degrees 
the bank competition for loans comes principally from mortgage banking companies  commercial banks  and savings institutions 
the bank most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks  savings institutions and credit unions 
competition for deposits also comes from money market mutual funds  corporate and government securities funds  and financial intermediaries such as brokerage firms and insurance companies 
many of the bank competitors have substantially greater resources and offer a wider array of financial services and products 
this combined with competitors larger presence in the new york market add to the challenges the bank faces in expanding its current market share and growing its near term profitability 
carver federal more than year history in its market area  its community involvement and relationships  targeted products and services and personal service consistent with community banking  help the bank compete with other competitors that have entered its market

in may  carver federal won another nmtc award in the amount of million and in february  the company announced that carver federal had been selected to receive a third nmtc award in the amount of million 
the nmtc award is used to stimulate economic development in low to moderate income communities 
the nmtc award enables the bank to invest with community and development partners in economic development projects with attractive terms including  in some cases  below market interest rates  which may have the effect of attracting capital to underserved communities and facilitating revitalization of the community  pursuant to the goals of the nmtc program 
the nmtc award provides a credit to carver federal against federal income taxes when the bank makes qualified investments 
in addition to the tax credit awards recognized  the company may transfer rights to an investor in a nmtc project and recognize a gain on the transfer of rights 
the company ability to realize the benefit of the tax credits is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income 
as of march   the and awards allocations have been fully utilized in qualifying projects

lending activities general 
carver federal loan portfolio consists primarily of mortgage loans originated by the bank lending teams and secured by commercial real estate  multi family and one to four family residential property and construction loans 
substantially all of the bank mortgage loans are secured by properties located within the bank market area 
from time to time  the bank may purchase loans from other financial institutions to achieve loan growth objectives 
loans purchased comply with the bank underwriting standards 
under the orders  the bank is required to improve its level of adversely classified assets and is restricted from origination commercial real estate cre loans until it reduces its current concentration of cre loans 
in recent years  carver federal has focused on the origination of commercial real estate loans and multi family residential loans 
these loans generally have higher yields and shorter maturities than one to four family residential properties  and include prepayment penalties that the bank collects if the loans pay in full prior to the contractual maturity 
the bank increased emphasis on portfolio management and monitoring of the commercial real estate and multi family residential mortgage loans was required given the increase of the overall level of credit risk inherent in this segment of the bank loan portfolio 
the greater risk associated with commercial real estate and multi family residential loans has required the bank to increase its provisions for loan losses and could require the bank to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance currently maintained 
carver federal continually reviews the composition of its mortgage loan portfolio and underwriting standards to manage the risk in the portfolio 
during fiscal  the bank began to deemphasize the origination of new construction loans and in fiscal ceased the origination of new construction loans  allowing the outstanding balance of the construction loan portfolio to decline 
as security for repayment  the bank obtains a first lien position on the underlying collateral  and generally obtains personal guarantees 
construction loans also generally have a term of two years or less 
construction loans involve a greater degree of risk than other loans because  among other things  the underwriting of such loans is based on an estimated value of the developed property  which can be difficult to ascertain in light of uncertainties inherent in such estimations 
in addition  construction lending entails the risk that the project may not be completed due to cost overruns or changes in market conditions 
the greater risk associated with construction loans has required the bank to increase its provision for loan losses  and could require the bank to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance the bank currently maintains 
to help mitigate risk  carver federal has originated construction loans principally through the community preservation corporation cpc 
these loans are targeted toward affordable housing or rental dwelling units that tend to have lower risk profiles compared to other construction loans discussed below 
carver federal business banking unit was formed in with the acquisition of ccb  a commercial bank  to focus on loans to businesses located within the bank market area 
these loans are generally personally guaranteed by the business owners  and may be secured by the assets of the business 
the interest rate on these loans is generally an adjustable rate based on a published index  usually the prime rate 
these loans  while providing the bank a higher rate of return  also present a higher level of risk 
the greater risk associated with business loans could require the bank to increase its provision for loan losses  and to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance currently maintained 
to date  carver federal has incurred some losses in the business loan portfolio  which are mainly related to loans acquired through the ccb acquisition 
loan portfolio composition 
total loans receivable decreased by million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march  carver federal total loans receivable as a percentage of total assets decreased to at march  compared to at march  non residential real estate loans  which includes commercial real estate  totaled million  or of total loans receivable  multi family loans totaled million  or of total loans receivable  construction loans net of committed but undisbursed funds  totaled million  or of total loans receivable  one to four family mortgage loans totaled million  or of total loans receivable  business loans totaled million  or of total loans receivable  and consumer loans credit card loans  personal loans  and home improvement loans totaled million or of total loans receivable 
the following is a summary of loans receivable  net of allowance for loan losses at march dollars in thousands march  march  march  march  march  amount amount amount amount amount gross loans receivable one to four family multifamily non residential construction business consumer and other total loans receivable add premium on loans less deferred fees and loan discounts allowance for loan losses total loans receivable  net includes personal loans non residential real estate lending 
non residential real estate lending consists predominantly of originating loans for the purpose of purchasing or refinancing office  mixed use properties used for both commercial and residential purposes but predominantly commercial  retail and church buildings in the bank market area 
mixed use loans are secured by properties which are intended for both residential and business use and are classified as commercial real estate 
non residential real estate lending entails additional risks compared with one to four family residential and multi family lending 
for example  such loans typically involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers  and the payment experience on such loans typically is dependent on the successful operation of the commercial property 
in making non residential real estate loans  the bank primarily considers the ability of the net operating income generated by the real estate to support the debt service  the financial resources  income level and managerial expertise of the borrower  the marketability of the property and the bank lending experience with the borrower 
carver federal maximum loan to value ltv ratio on non residential real estate mortgage loans at origination is generally based on the appraised value of the mortgaged property 
the bank generally requires a debt service coverage ratio dscr at origination of at least on non residential real estate loans 
the bank also requires the assignment of rents of all tenants leases in the mortgaged property and personal guarantees may be obtained for additional security from these borrowers 
at march   non residential real estate mortgage loans totaled million  or of the total loan portfolio 
this balance reflects a year over year decrease of million  or 
the decrease in originations in fiscal is the result of the company efforts to reduce its exposure to this segment of the new york and new jersey real estate market 
as of march   carver federal is not currently originating new commercial real estate loans 
the bank offers adjustable rate mortgage arm loans with interest rate adjustment periods of one to five years and generally for terms of up to years and amortization schedules up to thirty years 
interest rates on arm loans currently offered by the bank are adjusted at the beginning of each adjustment period are generally based upon a fixed spread above the fhlb ny corresponding regular advance rate 
from time to time  the bank may originate arm loans at an initial rate lower than the index as a result of a discount on the spread for the initial adjustment period 
commercial adjustable rate mortgage loans generally are not subject to limitations on interest rate increases either on an adjustment period or aggregate basis over the life of the loan 
historically  carver federal has been a new york city metropolitan area leader in the origination of loans to churches 
at march   loans to churches totaled million  or of the bank gross loan portfolio 
these loans generally have five  seven  or ten year terms with  or year amortization periods  a balloon payment due at the end of the term and generally have no greater than a ltv ratio at origination 
the bank has also provided construction financing for churches and generally provides permanent financing upon completion of construction 
there are currently church loans in the bank loan portfolio 
loans secured by real estate owned by faith based organizations generally are larger and involve greater risks than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by such properties are often dependent on voluntary contributions by members of the church congregation  repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy 
the bank seeks to minimize these risks in a variety of ways  including reviewing the organization financial condition  limiting the size of such loans and establishing the quality of the collateral securing such loans 
the bank determines the appropriate amount and type of security for such loans based in part upon the governance structure of the particular organization  the length of time the church has been established in the community and a cash flow analysis to determine the church ability to service the proposed loan 
carver federal will obtain a first mortgage on the underlying real property and often requires personal guarantees of key members of the congregation and or key person life insurance on the pastor 
the bank may also require the church to obtain key person life insurance on specific members of the church leadership 
while asset quality in the church loan category historically has been one of the strongest asset classes  recent economic conditions have produced some delinquencies in this portfolio 
management believes that carver federal will remain a leading lender to churches in its market area  however  carver will continue to conduct disciplined underwriting and maintain focused portfolio management 
multi family real estate lending 
traditionally  carver federal originates and purchases multi family loans 
multi family property lending entails additional risks compared to one to four family residential lending 
for example  such loans are dependent on the successful operation of such buildings and can be significantly impacted by supply and demand conditions in the market for multi family residential units 
carver federal multi family loan portfolio decreased million in fiscal  or to million  or  of carver federal total loan portfolio at march  as of march   carver federal is not currently originating new multi family loans 
in making multi family loans  the bank primarily considers the property ability to generate net operating income sufficient to support the debt service  the financial resources  income level and managerial expertise of the borrower  the marketability of the property and the bank lending experience with the borrower 
carver federal multi family product guidelines generally require that the maximum ltv at origination not exceed based on the appraised value of the mortgaged property on all such loans 
the bank generally requires a debt service coverage ratio at origination of at least on multi family loans  which requires the properties to generate cash flow after expenses and allowances in excess of the principal and interest payment 
carver federal originates and purchases multi family loans  which are predominantly adjustable rate loans that generally amortize on the basis of a   or year period and require a balloon payment after the first five years  or the borrower may have an option to extend the loan for two additional five year periods 
the bank occasionally originates fixed rate loans with greater than five year terms 
personal guarantees may be obtained for additional security from these borrowers 
to help ensure continued collateral protection and asset quality for the term of multi family real estate loans  carver federal employs a risk rating system for its loans 
all commercial loans  including multi family real estate loans  are risk rated internally at the time of origination 
management continually monitors all commercial loans in order to update risk ratings when necessary see asset classification and allowance for loan and lease losses for additional information on asset classification and risk ratings 
in addition  to evaluate changes in the credit profile of the borrower and the underlying collateral  an independent consulting firm reviews and prepares a written report for a sample of commercial loan relationships 
on a quarterly basis  i all new renewed loans greater than  ii a sampling of loans  to  and iii all criticized and classified loans are reviewed 
in addition  on an annual basis  all loans greater than  and a sampling of loans  to  are reviewed 
summary reports documenting the loan reviews are then reviewed by management for changes in the credit profile of individual borrowers and the portfolio as a whole 
construction lending 
the bank has historically originated or participated in construction loans for new construction and renovation of multi family buildings  residential developments  community service facilities  churches  and affordable housing programs 
the bank construction loans generally have adjustable interest rates and are underwritten in accordance with the same standards as the bank mortgage loans on existing properties 
the loans provide for disbursement in stages as construction is completed 
participation in construction loans may be at various stages of funding 
construction terms are usually from to months 
the construction loan interest is capitalized as part of the overall project cost and is funded monthly from the loan proceeds 
borrowers must satisfy all credit requirements that apply to the bank permanent mortgage loan financing for the mortgaged property 
carver federal has additional criteria for construction loans to include an engineer plan and cost review on all construction budgets with interest reserves for loans in excess of construction financing generally is considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long term financing on improved and occupied real estate 
risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the mortgaged property value at completion of construction or development and the estimated cost including interest of construction 
during the construction phase  a number of factors could result in project delays and cost overruns 
if the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate  the bank may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the development 
if the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate  the bank may be confronted  at or prior to the maturity of the loan  with a project having a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of such loan 
the ability of a developer to sell completed dwelling units will depend on  among other things  demand  pricing  availability of comparable properties and economic conditions 
during fiscal  the bank sought to minimize this risk by limiting construction lending to experienced borrowers in the bank market areas  limiting the aggregate amount of outstanding construction loans and imposing a stricter ltv ratio requirement than that required for one to four family mortgage loans 
since fiscal  the bank has ceased new construction lending 
at march   the bank had million net of million of committed but undisbursed funds in construction loans outstanding  comprising of the bank gross loan portfolio 
the balance at march  reflects a million  or  decrease over fiscal  consistent with the bank cessation of construction lending 
virtually all of the construction loans currently in carver loan portfolio comprise participations in loans originated by peer lenders in new york city 
the preponderance of these loans   are underwritten and serviced by the community preservation corporation cpc  a nationally recognized non profit corporation whose mission is to create affordable housing through new construction and renovation of existing buildings 
cpc is sponsored by more than commercial banks  savings institutions and insurance companies 
since its founding in  cpc has been responsible for providing over billion in private and public capital to create approximately  affordable homes in low and moderate income communities  in new york city  new jersey and connecticut 
consistent with other sponsoring lenders  carver participates in a portion of an individual cpc originated loan by purchasing up to of the total loan commitment to a developer 
cpc is carver agent in servicing the loans on a daily basis  including overseeing construction and collecting payments 
however carver lending team independently underwrites each participation and loans are approved pursuant to carver loan policy and underwriting guidelines 
carver lending team monitors progress in construction and other benchmarks via written reports and meetings with cpc staff  which are supplemented by site visits and direct communications with borrowers 
cpc sponsored developments provide affordable homes for purchase or rental 
loans for rental developments  when complete  are generally sold to the new york city pension fund 
of carver portfolio of cpc loans  comprised of loans in the amount of million  are for rental developments and are for sale 
most cpc homes are priced to target families at of the median income in new york city  which is approximately  this segment of the home buying market is very deep and typically resilient  given the expense of new york city living and the pent up demand of families living in public housing and other affordable rental housing  to purchase their first home 
since the recession in  continued difficult economic conditions have severely tested this previously successful model 
delinquency in the cpc loan portfolio in which carver participates has increased significantly 
at march   the largest contributor to carver delinquencies was the cpc portfolio  representing of total construction delinquencies and of the non performing portfolio 
the delinquency rate for these loans is 
the most significant factors leading to this delinquency was the federal government decision in to remove fannie mae and freddie mac from the secondary market 
as a result  loans for developments for which construction was complete could not be paid off because end loans  or mortgages for buyers  were non existent 
second  the lengthy period in which developers managed the dearth of mortgage loans  severely strained their finances  as they are typically smaller  local developers 
third  the loss of employment in the new york metropolitan area reduced confidence and demand in the home buying population 
the slow recovery in the home buying consumer mortgage business has resulted in an extended time frame for developers to finalize sales and repay their construction loans 
our strategy to manage this portfolio has been threefold 
first  we ceased additional construction lending in fiscal during fiscal  the construction loan portfolio has been reduced by million or  through pay offs and other resolutions 
second  we worked with cpc to develop an end loan product to provide mortgage financing for purchasers  if secondary market conditions do not rebound sufficiently 
third we are aggressive participants  along with cpc  in the servicing of each loan 
we currently believe that delinquencies in this portfolio will remain elevated for the foreseeable future 
to help ensure continued collateral protection and asset quality for the term of construction loans  carver federal employs a risk rating system for its loans 
all construction loans are risk rated internally at the time of origination 
management continually monitors all construction loans in order to update risk ratings when necessary see asset classification and allowance for loan and lease losses for additional information on asset classification and risk ratings 
in addition  to evaluate changes in the credit profile of the borrower and the underlying collateral  an independent consulting firm reviews and prepares a written report for a sample of construction loan relationships 
on a quarterly basis  i all new renewed loans greater than  ii a sampling of loans  to  and iii all criticized and classified loans are reviewed 
in addition  on an annual basis  all loans greater than  and a sampling of loans  to  are reviewed 
summary reports documenting the loan reviews are then reviewed by management for changes in the credit profile of individual borrowers and the portfolio as a whole 
one to four family residential lending 
historically  carver federal emphasized the origination and purchase of first mortgage loans secured by one to four family properties that serve as the primary residence of the owner 
to a much lesser degree  the bank has made loans to investors that are secured by non owner occupied one to four family properties  although this practice has been discontinued 
in the past the bank has also purchased one to four family loans  thousand was purchased in fiscal compared to no such loans purchased in fiscal or fiscal in october  the bank entered into an arrangement with a third party to originate and underwrite one to four family loans for the bank using fannie mae  freddie mac or fha underwriting guidelines 
carver federal offers both fixed rate and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans with maturities of up to years and a general maximum loan amount of million 
approximately of the one to four family residential mortgage loans maturing in greater than one year at march  were adjustable rate and approximately were fixed rate 
one to four family residential real estate loans decreased million to million  or  of the gross loan portfolio at march  compared to march  during fiscal the bank decreased its emphasis on one to four family lending due to more favorable pricing on multi family residential and commercial real estate lending 
the bank lending policies generally limit the maximum loan to value ltv ratio on one to four family residential mortgage loans secured by owner occupied properties to of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price  with private mortgage insurance required on loans with ltv ratios in excess of 
under certain special loan programs  carver federal may originate and sell loans secured by single family homes purchased by first time home buyers where the ltv ratio may be up to 
carver federal fixed rate  one to four family residential mortgage loans are underwritten in accordance with applicable secondary market underwriting guidelines and requirements for sale 
from time to time the bank has sold such loans to fannie mae  the state of new york mortgage agency sonyma and other third parties 
loans are generally sold with limited recourse on a servicing retained basis except to sonyma where the sale is made with servicing released 
carver federal uses several servicing firms to sub service mortgage loans  whether held in portfolio or sold with the servicing retained 
at march   the bank  through its sub servicers  serviced million in loans for fnma and million for other third parties 
carver federal offers one year  three year  five one year and five three year adjustable rate one to four family residential mortgage loans 
these loans are generally retained in carver federal portfolio although they may be sold in the secondary market 
they are indexed to the weekly average rate on one year  three year and five year us treasury or federal home loan bank fhlb securities  respectively  adjusted to a constant maturity usually one year  plus a margin 
the rates at which interest accrues on these loans are adjustable every one  three or five years  generally with limitations on adjustments of two percentage points per adjustment period and six percentage points over the life of a one year adjustable rate mortgage and four percentage points over the life of three year and five year adjustable rate mortgages 
the retention of adjustable rate loans in carver federal portfolio helps reduce carver federal exposure to increases in prevailing market interest rates 
however  there are credit risks resulting from potential increases in costs to borrowers in the event of upward re pricing of adjustable rate loans 
it is possible that during periods of rising interest rates  the risk of default on adjustable rate loans may increase due to increases in interest costs to borrowers 
although adjustable rate loans allow the bank to increase the sensitivity of its interest earning assets to changes in interest rates  the extent of this interest rate sensitivity is limited by periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limitations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that yields on the bank adjustable rate loans will fully adjust to compensate for increases in the bank cost of funds 
adjustable rate loans increase the bank exposure to decreases in prevailing market interest rates  although decreases in the bank cost of funds would tend to offset this effect 
in the past  the bank originated a limited amount of subprime loans  however  such lending has been discontinued 
at march   the bank had million in subprime loans  or  of its total loan portfolio of which million are non performing loans 
business loans 
carver federal small business lending portfolio decreased by million to million  or  of the bank gross loan portfolio in fiscal carver federal provides revolving credit and term loan facilities to small businesses with annual sales of approximately million to million in manufacturing  services and wholesale segments 
business loans are typically personally guaranteed by the owners  and may also be secured by additional collateral  including real estate  equipment and inventory 
included in commercial business loans are loans made to owners of new york city taxi medallions 
these loans  which totaled million at march   are secured through first liens on the taxi medallions 
carver federal originates taxi medallion loans in an amount up to of the value of the taxi medallion 
consumer and other loans 
at march   the bank had million in consumer and other loans  or  of the bank gross loan portfolio 
at march   million  or  of the bank consumer loans were unsecured loans  consisting of consumer loans  other than loans secured by savings deposits  and million or  were secured by savings deposits 
consumer loans generally involve more risk than first mortgage loans 
collection of a delinquent loan is dependent on the borrower continuing financial stability  and thus is more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
further  the application of various federal and state laws  including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount which can be recovered 
these loans may also give rise to claims and defenses by a borrower against carver federal and a borrower may be able to assert claims and defenses against carver federal which it has against the seller of the underlying collateral 
in underwriting unsecured consumer loans other than secured credit cards  carver federal considers the borrower credit history  an analysis of the borrower income  expenses and ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral 
the underwriting for secured credit cards only takes into consideration the value of the underlying collateral 
see asset quality non performing assets 
loan processing 
carver federal loan originations are derived from a number of sources  including referrals by realtors  builders  depositors  borrowers and mortgage brokers  as well as walk in and telephone customers 
loans are originated by the bank personnel who receive a base salary  commissions and other incentive compensation 
real estate  business and unsecured loan applications are forwarded to the bank lending department for underwriting pursuant to standards established in carver federal loan policy 
the underwriting and loan processing for residential one to four family loans are performed by an outsourced third party loan originator using lending standards established by the bank 
a commercial real estate loan application is completed for all multi family and non residential properties which the bank finances 
prior to loan approval  the property is inspected by a loan officer 
as part of the loan approval process  consideration is given to an independent appraisal  location  accessibility  stability of the neighborhood  environmental assessment  personal credit history of the applicant s and the financial capacity of the applicant s 
business loan applications are completed for all business loans 
most business loans are secured by real estate  personal guarantees  and or guarantees by the united states small business association sba or uniform commercial code ucc filings 
the loan approval process considers the credit history of the applicant  collateral  cash flow and purpose and stability of the business 
upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower  a credit report and other verifications are ordered to confirm specific information relating to the loan applicant income and credit standing 
it is the bank policy to obtain an appraisal of the real estate intended to secure a proposed mortgage loan from an independent appraiser approved by the bank 
it is carver federal policy to record a lien on the real estate securing the loan and to obtain a title insurance policy that insures that the property is free of prior encumbrances 
borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance policies prior to closing and  when the property is in a flood plain as designated by the department of housing and urban development  paid flood insurance policies must be obtained 
most borrowers are also required to advance funds on a monthly basis  together with each payment of principal and interest  to a mortgage escrow account from which the bank makes disbursements for items such as real estate taxes and hazard insurance 
written confirmation of the guarantee for sba loans and evidence of the ucc filing is also required 
loan approval 
except for real estate and business loans in excess of million and million  respectively  mortgage and business loan approval authority has been delegated by the bank board to the board asset liability and interest rate risk committee 
the asset liability and interest rate risk committee has delegated to the bank management loan committee  which consists of certain members of executive management  loan approval authority for loans up to and including million for real estate loans  million for business loans secured by real estate and million for all other business loans 
any loan that represents an exception to the bank lending policies must be ratified by the next higher approval authority 
real estate and business loans above million and million  respectively  must be approved by the full board 
purchased loans are subject to the same approval process as originated loans 
one to four family mortgage loans that conform to fnma standards and limits may be approved by the outsourced third party loan originator 
under the orders  the bank is restricted from originating new cre loans 
additionally  extensions or refinancing of existing cre loans require regulatory approval 
loans to one borrower 
under the loans to one borrower limits of the office of thrift supervision ots  with certain limited exceptions  loans and extensions of credit to a single or related group of borrowers outstanding at one time generally may not exceed of the unimpaired capital and surplus of a savings bank 
see regulation and supervision federal banking regulation loans to one borrower limitations 
at march   the maximum loans to one borrower under this test would be million and the bank had no relationships that exceeded this limit 
loan sales 
originations of one to four family real estate loans are generally made on properties located within the new york city metropolitan area  although carver federal occasionally funds loans secured by property in other areas 
all such loans  however  satisfy the bank underwriting criteria regardless of location 
the bank continues to offer one to four family fixed rate mortgage loans in response to consumer demand but requires that such loans satisfy applicable secondary market guidelines of fnma  sonyma or other third party purchaser to provide the opportunity for subsequent sale in the secondary market as desired to manage interest rate risk exposure 
loan originations and purchases 
loan originations  including loans originated for sale  were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal in prior years  the bank increased its loan production of non residential commercial real estate and multi family lending  including those in construction  to take advantage of higher yields and better interest rate risk characteristics 
however  due to the downturn in the real estate market and the economy in general  the bank has curtailed non owner occupied commercial real estate and construction lending given the additional risks associated with these products 
the bank purchased million in loans during fiscal compared to no loans purchased for fiscal and fiscal the following table sets forth certain information with respect to carver federal loan originations and advances  purchases and sales for the fiscal years ended march  in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent loans originated one to four family multi family non residential construction business consumer and others total loans originated loans purchased total loans originated and purchased loans sold net additions to loan portfolio comprised of personal loans 
comprised of one to four family residential  non residential and multifamily mortgage loans and business loans 
comprised of primarily one to four family mortgage loans 
loans purchased by the bank entail certain risks not necessarily associated with loans the bank originates 
the bank purchased loans are generally acquired without recourse  with certain exceptions related to the seller compliance with representations and warranties  and in accordance with the bank underwriting criteria for originations 
in addition  purchased loans have a variety of terms  including maturities  interest rate caps and indices for adjustment of interest rates  that may differ from those offered at that time by the bank 
the bank initially seeks to purchase loans in its market area  however  the bank may purchase loans secured by property secured outside its market area to meet its financial objectives 
the market areas in which the properties that secure the purchased loans are located may differ from carver federal market area and may be subject to economic and real estate market conditions that may significantly differ from those experienced in carver federal market area 
there can be no assurance that economic conditions in these out of state markets will not deteriorate in the future  resulting in increased loan delinquencies and loan losses among the loans secured by property in these areas 
in an effort to reduce risks  the bank has sought to ensure that purchased loans satisfy the bank underwriting standards and do not otherwise have a higher risk of collection or loss than loans originated by the bank 
a review of each loan is conducted prior to purchase  and the bank also requires appropriate documentation and further seeks to reduce its risk by requiring  in each buy sell agreement  a series of warranties and representations as to the underwriting standards and the enforceability of the related legal documents 
these warranties and representations remain in effect for the life of the loan 
any misrepresentation must be cured within days of discovery or trigger certain repurchase provisions in the buy sell agreement 
loan maturity schedule 
the following table sets forth information at march  regarding the amount of loans maturing in carver federal portfolio  including scheduled repayments of principal  based on contractual terms to maturity 
demand loans  loans having no schedule of repayments and no stated maturity  and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less 
construction loans generally have terms from to months and when coupled with the significant decline in originations over the past two years  the construction loan portfolio has a maturity of less than one year

the average life of long term loans is substantially less than their contractual terms due to prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses in mortgage loans generally give carver federal the right to declare a conventional loan due and payable in the event  among other things  that a borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid

one of the bank key operating objectives continues to be to maintain a high level of asset quality 
through a variety of strategies  including  but not limited to  monitoring loan delinquencies and borrower workout arrangements  the bank has been proactive in addressing problem loans and non performing assets 
the underlying credit quality of the bank loan portfolio is dependent primarily on each borrower ability to continue to make required loan payments and  in the event a borrower is unable to continue to do so  the adequacy of the value of the collateral securing the loan 
for non owner occupied non residential real estate and multi family loans  the borrower ability to pay typically is dependent on rental income  which can be impacted by vacancies and general market conditions 
for one to four family loans  a borrowers ability to pay typically is dependent primarily on employment and other sources of income 
for owner occupied non residential real estate  a borrower ability to pay typically is dependent primarily on the success of the borrower business 
for all of the bank loans  a borrower ability to pay is also impacted by general economic and other factors  such as unanticipated expenditures or changes in the financial markets 
collateral values  particularly real estate values  are also impacted by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  demographics  maintenance and collection or foreclosure delays 
non performing assets 
non performing assets consist of non accrual loans and property acquired in settlement of loans  including foreclosure 
when a borrower fails to make a payment on a loan  the bank and or its loan servicers takes prompt steps to have the delinquency cured and the loan restored to current status 
this includes a series of actions such as phone calls  letters  customer visits and  if necessary  legal action 
in the event the loan has a guarantee  the bank may seek to recover on the guarantee  including  where applicable  from the small business administration sba 
loans that remain delinquent are reviewed for reserve provisions and charge off 
the bank collection efforts continue after the loan is charged off  except when a determination is made that collection efforts have been exhausted or are not productive 
the bank may from time to time agree to modify the contractual terms of a borrower loan 
in cases where such modifications represent a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty  the modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring tdr 
loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring are placed on non accrual status until the bank determines that future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured  which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance according to the restructured terms for a minimum of six months 
at march   loans classified as a troubled debt restructuring totaled million 
the following table sets forth information with respect to carver federal non performing assets  which includes non accrual loans  and property acquired in settlement of loans as of march  dollars in thousands loans accounted for on a non accrual basis gross loans receivable one to four family multi family non residential construction business consumer total non performing loans other non performing assets real estate owned total other non performing assets total non performing assets accruing loans contractually past due days non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total assets non accrual status denotes any loan where the delinquency exceeds days past due and loans  in the opinion of management  for which the collection of additional interest is doubtful 
payments received on a non accrual loan are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management assessment of the ability to collect on the loan 
other non performing assets generally represent property acquired by the bank in settlement of loans ie  through foreclosure  repossession or as an in substance foreclosure 
these assets are recorded at the lower of their fair value or the cost to acquire 
troubled debt restructured loans performing in accordance with their modified terms for less than six months and those not performing to their modified terms are considered non accrual and are included in the non accrual category in the table above 
tdr loans that have performed in accordance with their modified terms for a period of at least six months are generally considered performing loans and are not presented in the table above 
loans days or more past due and still accruing  which were not included in the non performing category  are presented in the above table 
loans past due days or more and still accruing represent mostly family loans where the loan servicer is contractually obligated to make payments 
at march   total non performing assets increased by million to million  compared to million at march  non accrual loans consist of one to four family loans  multi family loans  non residential real estate loans  construction loans  consumer and small business and sba loans 
the increase in delinquent loans from the prior year is primarily the result of continued unfavorable economic conditions and resultant impact on borrower ability to meet the terms of their loans 
management believes that there will likely be losses on certain delinquent loans  but that the amount of losses will be reduced by the values of the properties securing these delinquent loans and the bank loan loss reserves 
other real estate owned of million reflects two properties foreclosed upon 
although we believe that substantially all risk elements at march  have been disclosed  it is possible that for a variety of reasons  including economic conditions  certain borrowers may be unable to comply with the contractual repayment terms on certain real estate and commercial loans 
asset classification and allowances for losses 
federal regulations and the bank policies require the classification of assets on the basis of credit quality on a quarterly basis 
an asset is classified as substandard if it is non performing and or determined to be inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the current value of the collateral pledged  if any 
an asset is classified as doubtful if full collection is highly questionable or improbable 
an asset is classified as loss if it is considered un collectible  even if a partial recovery could be expected in the future 
the regulations also provide for a special mention designation  described as assets that do not currently expose a savings institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management close attention 
assets classified as substandard or doubtful result in a higher level of allowances for loan losses recorded in accordance with accounting standards codification asc subtopic loss contingencies 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as a loss  a savings institution must either establish specific allowances for loan losses pursuant to loan impairment guidance in asc subtopic in the amount of the portion of the asset classified as a loss or charge off such amount 
federal examiners may disagree with a savings institution classifications 
if a savings institution does not agree with an examiner classification of an asset  it may appeal this determination to the ots regional director 
the ots  in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies  has adopted an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan losses and lease losses alll 
the policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of adequate allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation guidelines 
generally  the policy statement recommends that institutions have effective systems and controls to identify  monitor and address asset quality problems  that management analyze all significant factors that affect the ability to collect the portfolio in a reasonable manner and that management establish acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement 
management is responsible for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the periodic provisioning for estimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements 
the evaluation process is undertaken on a quarterly basis  but may increase in frequency should conditions arise that would require management prompt attention  such as business combinations and opportunities to dispose of non performing and marginally performing loans by bulk sale or any development which may indicate an adverse trend 
although management believes that adequate specific and general loan loss allowances have been established  actual losses are dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the level of specific and general loan loss allowances may become necessary 
federal examiners may disagree with a savings institution as to the appropriate level of the institution allowance for loan losses 
while management believes carver federal has established its existing loss allowances in accordance with the alll policy  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing carver federal assets  will not require carver federal to increase its loss allowance  thereby negatively affecting carver federal reported financial condition and results of operations 
for additional information regarding carver federal alll policy  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
the board has designated the internal asset review committee of management to perform a review on a quarterly basis of the bank asset quality  establish general and specific allowances  determine loan classifications and submit their report to the board for review 
carver federal methodology for establishing the allowance for loan losses takes into consideration probable losses that have been identified in connection with specific loans as well as losses that have not been identified but can be expected to occur 
further  management reviews the ratio of allowances to total loans and recommends adjustments to the level of allowances accordingly 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowances for losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the economic conditions in the assumptions used in making the initial determinations  or if circumstances pertaining to individual loans change  or new information pertaining to individual loans or the loan portfolio is identified 
the bank has a centralized loan servicing structure that relies upon outside servicers  each of which generates a monthly report of delinquent loans 
the asset liability and interest rate risk committees of the board establish policy relating to internal classification of loans and also provides input to the internal asset review committee in its review of classified assets 
in originating loans  carver federal recognizes that credit losses will occur and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  general economic conditions and  in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the security for the loan 
it is management policy to maintain a general allowance for loan losses based on  among other things  regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality  character and size  the bank and the industry historical and projected loss experience and current and forecasted economic conditions and certain qualitative factors 
in addition  considerable uncertainty exists as to the future improvement or deterioration of the real estate market 
see lending activities loan purchases and originations 
carver federal increases its allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for possible losses against the bank income 
general allowances are established by management on at least a quarterly basis based on an assessment of risk in the bank loans  taking into consideration the composition and quality of the portfolio  delinquency trends  current charge off and loss experience  the state of the real estate market and economic conditions generally 
specific allowances are provided for individual loans  or portions of loans  when ultimate collection is considered improbable by management based on the current payment status of the loan and the fair value or net realizable value of the security for the loan 
a loan is deemed impaired when it is probable the bank will be unable to collect both principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
loans the bank individually classifies as impaired include multi family mortgage loans  commercial real estate loans  construction loans and business loans which have been classified by the bank credit review officer as substandard  doubtful or loss for which it is probable that principal and interest will not be collected in accordance with the loan contractual terms  and certain loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring a valuation allowance for collateral dependent loans is established when the current estimated fair value of the property that collateralizes the impaired loan  if any  is less than the recorded investment in the loan 
a valuation allowance for cash flow dependent loans is established when based upon a discounted cash flow analysis  impairment is demonstrated 
at the date of foreclosure or other repossession  the bank transfers the property to real estate acquired in settlement of loans at the lower of cost or fair value  less estimated selling costs 
fair value is defined as the amount in cash or cash equivalent value of other consideration that a real estate parcel would yield in a current sale between a willing buyer and a willing seller 
any amount of cost in excess of fair value is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
carver federal records an allowance for estimated selling costs of the property immediately after foreclosure 
subsequent to taking possession of the property  management periodically evaluates the property and an allowance is established if the estimated fair value of the property  less estimated costs to sell  declines 
if  upon ultimate disposition of the property  net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the property  a gain on sale of real estate is recorded  providing the bank did not provide financing for the sale 
the following table sets forth an analysis of carver federal allowance for loan losses for the years ended march dollars in thousands balance at beginning of year less charge offs one to four family non residential business consumer and other total charge offs add recoveries one to four family non residential business consumer and other total recoveries net loans charged off ccb acquisition allowance provision for losses balance at end of year ratios net charge offs to average loans outstanding allowance to total loans allowance to non performing loans the following table allocates the allowance for loan losses by asset category at march dollars in thousands amount of loans to total gross loans amount of loans to total gross loans amount of loans to total gross loans amount of loans to total gross loans amount of loans to total gross loans allowance for loan losses one to four family multi family non residential construction business consumer and other unallocated total allowance the allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category 
investment activities general 
the bank utilizes mortgage backed and other investment securities in its asset liability management strategy 
in making investment decisions  the bank considers  among other things  its yield and interest rate objectives  its interest rate and credit risk position and its liquidity and cash flow 
generally  the investment policy of the bank is to invest funds among categories of investments and maturities based upon the bank asset liability management policies  investment quality  loan and deposit volume and collateral requirements  liquidity needs and performance objectives 
asc subtopic requires that securities be classified into three categories trading  held to maturity  and available for sale 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
debt securities for which the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
all other securities not classified as trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included  on an after tax basis  in a separate component of stockholders equity 
at march   the bank had no securities classified as trading 
at march   million  or of the bank mortgage backed and other investment securities  was classified as available for sale 
the remaining million  or  was classified as held to maturity 
mortgage backed securities 
the bank has invested in mortgage backed securities to help achieve its asset liability management goals and collateral needs 
although mortgage backed securities generally yield less than whole loans  they present substantially lower credit risk  are more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize obligations of the bank 
because carver federal receives regular payments of principal and interest from its mortgage backed securities  these investments provide more consistent cash flows than investments in other debt securities  which generally only pay principal at maturity 
mortgage backed securities also help the bank meet certain definitional tests for favorable treatment under federal banking and tax laws 
see regulation and supervision federal banking regulation qualified thrift lender test and federal and state taxation 
at march   mortgage backed securities constituted of total assets  as compared to of total assets at march  carver federal maintains a portfolio of mortgage backed securities in the form of government national mortgage association gnma pass through certificates  federal national mortgage association fnma and federal home loan mortgage corp fhlmc participation certificates 
gnma pass through certificates are guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the united states government while fnma and fhlmc certificates are each guaranteed by their respective agencies as to principal and interest 
mortgage backed securities generally entitle carver federal to receive a pro rata portion of the cash flows from an identified pool of mortgages 
the cash flows from such pools are segmented and paid in accordance with a predetermined priority to various classes of securities issued by the entity 
carver federal has also invested in pools of loans guaranteed as to principal and interest by the small business administration sba 
the bank seeks to manage interest rate risk by investing in adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  which at march   constituted million  or  of the mortgage backed securities portfolio 
mortgage backed securities  however  expose carver federal to certain unique risks 
in a declining rate environment  accelerated prepayments of loans underlying these securities expose carver federal to the risk that it will be unable to obtain comparable yields upon reinvestment of the proceeds 
in the event the mortgage backed security has been funded with an interest bearing liability with maturity comparable to the original estimated life of the mortgage backed security  the bank interest rate spread could be adversely affected 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  the bank may experience a lower than estimated rate of repayment on the underlying mortgages  effectively extending the estimated life of the mortgage backed security and exposing the bank to the risk that it may be required to fund the asset with a liability bearing a higher rate of interest 
for additional information regarding carver federal mortgage backed securities portfolio and its maturities refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements  securities 
other investment securities 
in addition to mortgage backed securities  the bank also invests in high quality assets primarily government and agency obligations with short and intermediate terms typically seven years or less to maturity 
carver federal is permitted under federal law to make certain investments  including investments in securities issued by various federal agencies and state and municipal governments  deposits at the fhlb ny  certificates of deposit in federally insured institutions  certain bankers acceptances and federal funds 
the bank may also invest  subject to certain limitations  in commercial paper having one of the two highest investment ratings of a nationally recognized credit rating agency  and certain other types of corporate debt securities and mutual funds see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other earning assets 
federal regulations require the bank to maintain an investment in fhlb ny stock and a sufficient amount of liquid assets which may be invested in cash and specified securities 
for additional information  see regulation and supervision federal banking regulation liquidity 
securities impairment 
the bank available for sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
securities that the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
the fair values of securities in portfolio are based on published or securities dealers market values and are affected by changes in interest rates 
the bank quarterly reviews and evaluates the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its cost basis is other than temporary 
the bank generally views changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary  which is consistent with its experience 
in april  the fasb issued guidance that changes the amount of an other than temporary impairment that is recognized in earnings when there are non credit losses on a debt security which management does not intend to sell  and for which it is more likely than not that the entity will not be required to sell the security prior to the recovery of the non credit impairment 
in those situations  the portion of the total impairment that is attributable to the credit loss would be recognized in earnings  and the remaining difference between the debt security amortized cost basis and its fair value would be included in other comprehensive income 
this guidance also requires additional disclosures about investments in an unrealized loss position and the methodology and significant inputs used in determining the recognition of other than temporary impairment 
at march   the bank held a private label mortgage backed security which was determined to be other than temporarily impaired in the amount of thousand 
as of fiscal year end  the bank no longer holds this security 
at march   the bank does not have any other securities that may be classified as having other than temporary impairment in its investment portfolio 
sources of funds general 
deposits are the primary source of carver federal funds for lending and other investment purposes 
in addition to deposits  carver federal derives funds from loan principal repayments  loan and investment interest payments  maturing investments and fee income 
loan and mortgage backed securities repayments and interest payments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by prevailing market interest rates  pricing of deposits  competition and general economic conditions 
borrowed money may be used to supplement the bank available funds  and from time to time the bank borrows funds from the fhlb ny and has borrowed funds through repurchase agreements and trust preferred debt securities 
deposits 
carver federal attracts deposits from consumers  businesses  non profit organizations and public entities through its nine branches principally from within its market area by offering a variety of deposit instruments  including passbook and statement accounts and certificates of deposit  which range in term from days to five years 
deposit terms vary  principally on the basis of the minimum balance required  the length of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate 
carver federal also offers individual retirement accounts 
carver federal policies are designed primarily to attract deposits from local residents and businesses through the bank branches 
carver federal also holds deposits from various governmental agencies or authorities and corporations 
the bank branches on th street and th street in harlem and its jamaica branches operate in new york state designated banking development districts bdd  which allows carver federal to participate in bdd related activities  including acquiring new york city and new york state deposits 
as of march   carver federal held million in bdd deposits 
bdd deposits are used by various municipal agencies to encourage banking operations in low to moderate income areas 
during the fiscal year  the bank jamaica branch no longer qualified to participate in the bdd program resulting in the bank returning million in bdd deposits 
as of march  the bank also has million of reciprocal deposits acquired through its participation in the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars 
the cdars network arranges for placement of carver federal customer funds into certificate of deposit accounts issued by other cdars member banks in increments of less than the individual fdic insurance limit amount to ensure that both principal and interest are eligible for full fdic deposit insurance 
this allows the bank to maintain its customer relationship while still providing its customers with fdic insurance for the full amount of their deposits  up to million per customer 
in exchange  carver federal receives from other member banks their customer deposits in like amounts 
depositors are allowed to withdraw funds  with a penalty  from these accounts 
these allow a variety of maturities  but have penalties for early withdrawal 
carver federal may elect to participate in the program by making or receiving deposits without making or receiving a reciprocal deposit 
prior to the emergency economic stabilization act of essa the fdic deposit insurance limit was  as result of essa  this limit was increased to  through december  on july   president barack obama signed the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act into law  which  in part  permanently raised the standard maximum deposit insurance amount to  in february  the orders issued to carver federal restricted carver ability to add new cdars deposit accounts and renew existing cdars deposit accounts 
carver federal applied for a brokered deposit waiver through the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to allow for the renewal of the existing cdars deposit base 
during the period that carver was waiting for the fdic brokered deposit waiver  maturing deposits were placed in a one way cdar which allowed the carver customer to maintain the product  but not longer counted as a deposit liability for carver  because it was no longer reciprocal 
this allowed carver to meet the clients needs  while remaining compliant with the orders 
at march   the bank had placed million of customer funds into the program 
in april the fdic approved carver federal brokered deposit waiver  allowing for the renewal of the existing cdars deposit base 
the brokered deposit waiver is limited to cdars maturing in the first quarter of fiscal carver federal has applied for a brokered deposit waiver for cdar deposit accounts maturing in the second quarter of fiscal carver federal is awaiting a decision from the fdic 
deposit interest rates  maturities  service fees and withdrawal penalties on deposits are established based on the bank funds acquisition and liquidity requirements  the rates paid by the bank competitors  current market rates  the bank growth goals and applicable regulatory restrictions and requirements

borrowed money 
while deposits are the primary source of funds for carver federal lending  investment and general operating activities  carver federal is authorized to use advances from the fhlb ny and securities sold under agreements to repurchase repos from approved primary dealers to supplement its supply of funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements 
the fhlb ny functions as a central bank providing credit for savings institutions and certain other member financial institutions 
as a member of the fhlb system  carver federal is required to own stock in the fhlb ny and is authorized to apply for advances 
advances are made pursuant to several different programs  each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
advances from the fhlb ny are secured by carver federal stock in the fhlb ny and a pledge of carver federal mortgage loan and mortgage backed and agency securities portfolios 
the bank takes into consideration the term of borrowed money with the re pricing cycle of the mortgage loans on the balance sheet 
at march   carver had million in fhlb ny advances and million in repos 
during fiscal year the fhlb ny increased the collateral requirements on carver existing advances 
fhlb ny could institute additional collateral requirements or restrict carver ability to access additional advances or renew maturing advances 
on september   carver statutory trust i issued  shares  liquidation amount  per share  of floating rate capital securities 
gross proceeds from the sale of these trust preferred debt securities were million and  together with the proceeds from the sale of the trust common securities  were used to purchase approximately million aggregate principal amount of the holding company floating rate junior subordinated debt securities due the trust preferred debt securities are redeemable quarterly at the option of the company beginning on or after september  and have a mandatory redemption date of september  cash distributions on the trust preferred debt securities are cumulative and payable at a floating rate per annum reset quarterly equal to over month libor  with a rate at march  of 
under the orders  the company is prohibited from paying dividends without prior ots approval 
therefore the company has deferred the debenture interest payments 
on september   the bank raised million in a private placement of subordinated debt maturing december  the maximum contractual interest rate for the debt is per annum  however  for the first seven years  and so long as carver maintains its certification as a community development entity cde and remains in compliance with all of the nmtc requirements  the interest rate shall be reduced by basis points to per annum 
this subordinated debt has been approved by the ots to qualify as tier ii capital for the bank regulatory capital calculations 
these subordinated debt securities amounted to million at march  and are included in other borrowed money on the consolidated statement of financial condition

these proceeds were used to increase the bank liquidity position and for general corporate purposes 
regulation and supervision general on february   carver federal savings bank and carver bancorp  inc consented to enter into cease and desist orders orders with the ots 
the ots is issuing this order based upon its findings that the company is operating with an inadequate level of capital for the volume  type and quality of assets held by the company  that it is operating with an excessive level of adversely classified assets and that its earnings are inadequate to augment its capital 
the order includes a capital directive requiring the bank to achieve and maintain minimum regulatory capital levels of a tier i core capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of by april  the orders also contains restrictions on future extensions of credit and requires the development of various procedures to improve the bank asset quality 
for additional information regarding the order please see the form k filed with the sec on february  as a result  the company is in an active process with several investors to raise new capital 
there can be no assurance  however  that any of these efforts will be successful 
to the extent that the company is not successful in its efforts to meet these capital directives by april   the company must submit a contingency plan that is acceptable to the ots 
this contingency plan must detail the actions the company will take  with specific time frames  to either merge with or be acquired by another federally insured depository institution or holding company or to voluntarily dissolve the company 
the company did not raise the additional capital by april  and thus filed the required contingency plan with the ots 
if the contingency plan is acted upon it may result in the sale or unwinding of the company 
on june  the company raised million of capital 
the million resulted in a million increase in liquidity net of the effect of various expenses associated with the capital raise 
in addition  the company intends to downstream million to carver federal savings bank  the company wholly owned bank subsidiary 
no assurances can be given that the amount of capital raised is sufficient to absorb the expected losses emanating from the bank loan portfolio 
should the losses be greater than expected additional capital may be necessary in the future 
in addition  no assurances can be given that the bank and the company will continue to comply with all provisions of the order 
failure to comply with these provisions could result in further regulatory actions to be taken by the regulators 
under the orders  the bank and company are also prohibited from paying any dividends without prior ots approval  and  as such  have suspended the regularly quarterly cash dividend payments on the company fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued under the capital purchase program to the united states department of treasury and have deferred carver statutory trust i debenture interest payments 
the bank is subject to extensive regulation  examination and supervision by its primary regulator  the ots 
the bank deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic under the deposit insurance fund dif  and is a member of the fhlb 
the bank must file reports with the ots concerning its activities and financial condition  and it must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions  such as mergers with  or acquisitions of  other depository institutions 
the holding company  as a unitary savings and loan holding company  is subject to regulation  examination and supervision by the ots and is required to file certain reports with  and otherwise comply with  the rules and regulations of the ots and of the sec under the federal securities laws 
the ots and the fdic periodically perform safety and soundness examinations of the bank and the holding company and test compliance with various regulatory requirements 
the ots has primary enforcement responsibility over federally chartered savings banks and has substantial discretion to impose enforcement action on an institution that fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  particularly with respect to its capital requirements 
in addition  the fdic has the authority to recommend to the director of the ots that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular federally chartered savings bank and  if action is not taken by the director  the fdic has authority to take such action under certain circumstances 
this regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework to regulate and control the activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors 
this structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
any change in such laws and regulations whether by the ots  the fdic or through legislation could have a material adverse impact on the bank and the holding company and their operations and stockholders 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the dodd frank act made extensive changes in the regulation of federal savings banks such as the bank 
under the dodd frank act  the office of thrift supervision will be eliminated 
responsibility for the supervision and regulation of federal savings banks will be transferred to the office of the comptroller of the currency  which is the agency that is currently primarily responsible for the regulation and supervision of national banks 
the office of the comptroller of the currency will assume responsibility for implementing and enforcing many of the laws and regulations applicable to federal savings banks 
the transfer of regulatory functions will take place over a transition period of up to one year from the dodd frank act enactment date of july  at the same time  responsibility for the regulation and supervision of savings and loan holding companies  such as colonial financial services  inc will be transferred to the federal reserve board  which currently supervises bank holding companies 
additionally  the dodd frank act creates a new consumer financial protection bureau as an independent bureau of the federal reserve board 
the consumer financial protection bureau will assume responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations  a function currently assigned to prudential regulators  and will have authority to impose new requirements 
however  institutions of less than billion in assets  such as colonial bank  fsb  will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by  and be subject to the primary enforcement authority of  their prudential regulator rather than the consumer financial protection bureau 
in addition to eliminating the office of thrift supervision and creating the consumer financial protection bureau  the dodd frank act  among other things  requires changes in the way that institutions are assessed for deposit insurance  mandates the imposition of consolidated capital requirements on savings and loan holding companies  requires that originators of securitized loans retain a percentage of the risk for the transferred loans  directs the federal reserve board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees  reduces the federal preemption afforded to federal savings associations and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage originations 
many of the provisions of the dodd frank act contain delayed effective dates and or require the issuance of regulations 
as a result  it will be some time before their impact on operations can be assessed by management 
however  there is a significant possibility that the dodd frank act will  at a minimum  result in an increased regulatory burden and higher compliance  operating  and possibly  interest costs for the bank and the company the description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to federally chartered savings banks and their holding companies and of tax matters set forth in this document does not purport to be a complete description of all such statutes and regulations and their effects on the bank and the holding company 
prompt corrective action regulations 
under the prompt corrective action regulations  the ots is authorized and  in some cases  required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings banks 
for this purpose  a savings bank would be placed in one of the following five categories based on the bank regulatory capital well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized 
the severity of the action authorized or required to be taken under the prompt corrective action regulations increases as a bank capital decreases within the three undercapitalized categories 
all banks are prohibited from paying dividends or other capital distributions or paying management fees to any controlling person if  following such distribution  the bank would be undercapitalized 
generally  a capital restoration plan must be filed with the ots within days of the date a bank receives notice that it is undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
in addition  various mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to the institution  including restrictions on growth of assets and other forms of expansion 
under the ots regulations  generally  a federally chartered savings bank is treated as well capitalized if its total risk based capital ratio is or greater  its tier risk based capital ratio is or greater  and its leverage ratio is or greater  and it is not subject to any order or directive by the ots to meet a specific capital level 
when appropriate  the ots can require corrective action by a savings association holding company under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law 
bank regulatory matters 
in february  the holding company and bank agreed with the office of thrift supervision to take certain actions related to its operations and regulatory compliance 
the agreement provides that the bank will take certain actions including adoption of an enhanced loan concentration policy  which includes reducing the level of commercial real estate loans relative to capital  limiting the level of brokered deposits and enhancing bank secrecy act bsa compliance 
the holding company and bank believes that they will be able to satisfy the terms of the agreement and have already implemented aggressive steps to address these matters 
limitation on capital distributions 
the ots imposes various restrictions on a bank ability to make capital distributions  including cash dividends  payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares and other distributions charged against capital 
a savings institution that is the subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company  such as the bank  must file a notice with the ots at least days before making a capital distribution 
however  the bank must file an application for prior approval if the total amount of its capital distributions including each proposed distribution  for the applicable calendar year would exceed the bank net income for that year plus the bank retained net income for the previous two years 
the bank may not pay dividends to the holding company if  after paying those dividends  the bank would fail to meet the required minimum levels under risk based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage and tangible capital ratio requirements or the ots notified the bank that it was in need of more than normal supervision 
the bank is prohibited from making capital distributions if the bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution  the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns  or the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute  regulation or agreement 
enforcement 
the ots has primary enforcement responsibility over the bank 
this enforcement authority includes  among other things  the ability to assess civil money penalties  to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers 
in general  these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
standards for safety and soundness 
the ots has adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards 
the guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings  compensation  fees and benefits 
in general  the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
in addition  ots regulations authorize  but do not require  the ots to order an institution that has been given notice that it is not satisfying these safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan 
if  after being so notified  an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan  the ots must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized association is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law 
if an institution fails to comply with such an order  the ots may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties 
recent government actions the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa  was signed into law on october  and authorizes the us department of the treasury treasury to establish the troubled asset relief program tarp to purchase certain troubled assets from financial institutions  including banks and thrifts 
under the tarp  the treasury may purchase residential and commercial mortgages  and securities  obligations or other instruments based on such mortgages  originated or issued on or before march  that the secretary of the treasury determines promotes market stability  as well as any other financial instrument that the treasury  after consultation with the chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  or frb  determines the purchase of which is necessary to promote market stability 
in the case of a publicly traded financial institution that sells troubled assets into the tarp  the treasury must receive a warrant giving the treasury the right to receive nonvoting common stock or preferred stock in such financial institution  or voting stock with respect to which the treasury agrees not to exercise voting power  subject to certain de minimis exceptions 
in addition  all financial institutions that sell troubled assets to the tarp and meet certain conditions will also be subject to certain executive compensation restrictions  which differ depending on how the troubled assets are acquired under the tarp 
on october   the treasury announced that it will purchase equity stakes in a wide variety of banks and thrifts 
under this program  known as the troubled asset relief program capital purchase program the tarp cpp  the treasury made billion of capital available from the billion authorized by the eesa to us financial institutions in the form of preferred stock 
in conjunction with the purchase of preferred stock  the treasury will receive warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to of the preferred investment 
participating financial institutions will be required to adopt the treasury standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the treasury holds equity issued under the tarp cpp 
on january   the company announced that it completed the sale of million in preferred stock to the treasury in connection with carver participation in the tarp cpp 
importantly  carver is exempt from the requirement to issue a warrant to the treasury to purchase shares of common stock  as the bank is a certified community development financial institution cdfi  conducting most of its depository and lending activities in disadvantaged communities 
therefore  the investment did not dilute common stockholders 
as a participant in tarp cpp  the company is subject to certain obligations currently in effect  such as compensation restrictions  a luxury expenditure policy  the requirement the company include a say on pay proposal in the proxy statement and certain certifications 
the company is also subject to additional restrictions or obligations as may be imposed under tarp cpp for as long as the company participates in tarp cpp 
the treasury announced in february the implementation of the community development capital initiative cdci 
this new capital program will invest lower cost capital in community development financial institutions that lend to small businesses in the country most economically depressed communities 
cdfi banks and thrifts are eligible to receive investments of capital with an initial dividend rate of percent  compared to the percent rate offered under the cpp 
cdfis may apply to receive capital up to percent of risk weighted assets 
to encourage repayment while recognizing the unique circumstances facing cdfis  the dividend rate will increase to percent after eight years  compared to five years under cpp 
on august   carver completed the exchange of the million of cpp funds for an equivalent amount of cdci funds 
the previously described cease and desist order carver entered into with the ots prohibits the company from paying dividends without prior ots approval  and as such  has suspended the regularly quarterly cash dividend payment on the company fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued under the cdci program 
activity powers 
the bank derives its lending and investment powers from the home owners loan act hola  as amended  and federal regulations 
under these laws and regulations  the bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate  commercial and consumer loans  certain types of debt securities and certain other assets 
the bank may also establish service corporations that may engage in activities not otherwise permissible for the bank  including certain real estate equity investments and securities and insurance brokerage 
the bank authority to invest in certain types of loans or other investments is limited by federal law 
these investment powers are subject to various limitations  including a prohibition against the acquisition of any corporate debt security that is not rated in one of the four highest rating categories  a limit of of an association capital on the aggregate amount of loans secured by non residential real estate property  a limit of of an association assets on commercial loans  with the amount of commercial loans in excess of of assets being limited to small business loans  a limit of of an association assets on the aggregate amount of consumer loans and acquisitions of certain debt securities  a limit of of assets on non conforming loans loans in excess of the specific limitations of hola  and a limit of the greater of of assets or an association capital on certain construction loans made for the purpose of financing what is or is expected to become residential property 
on october   the ots and other federal bank regulatory authorities published the interagency guidance on nontraditional mortgage product risks  or the guidance 
the guidance describes sound practices for managing risk  as well as marketing  originating and servicing nontraditional mortgage products  which include  among other things  interest only loans 
the guidance sets forth supervisory expectations with respect to loan terms and underwriting standards  portfolio and risk management practices and consumer protection 
for example  the guidance indicates that originating interest only loans with reduced documentation is considered a layering of risk and that institutions are expected to demonstrate mitigating factors to support their underwriting decision and the borrower repayment capacity 
specifically  the guidance indicates that a lender should be able to readily document income and a lender may accept a borrower statement as to the borrower income without obtaining verification only if there are mitigating factors that clearly minimize the need for direct verification of repayment capacity 
on december   the ots published guidance entitled concentrations in commercial real estate lending  sound risk management practices  or the cre guidance  to address concentrations of commercial real estate loans in savings associations 
the cre guidance reinforces and enhances the ots existing regulations and guidelines for real estate lending and loan portfolio management  but does not establish specific commercial real estate lending limits 
the bank has evaluated the cre guidance to determine its compliance and  as necessary  modified its risk management practices  underwriting guidelines and consumer protection standards 
see lending activities and asset quality in item  business for discussions of carver federal loan product offerings and related underwriting standards 
on june   the ots and other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final statement on subprime mortgage lending  or the statement  to address the growing concerns facing the subprime mortgage market  particularly with respect to rapidly rising subprime default rates that may indicate borrowers do not have the ability to repay adjustable rate subprime loans originated by financial institutions 
in particular  the agencies expressed concern in the statement that current underwriting practices do not take into account that many subprime borrowers are not prepared for payment shock and that the current subprime lending practices compound risk for financial institutions 
the statement describes the prudent safety and soundness and consumer protection standards that financial institutions should follow to ensure borrowers obtain loans that they can afford to repay 
these standards include a fully indexed  fully amortized qualification for borrowers and cautions on risk layering features  including an expectation that stated income and reduced documentation should be accepted only if there are documented mitigating factors that clearly minimize the need for verification of a borrower repayment capacity 
consumer protection standards include clear and balanced product disclosures to customers and limits on prepayment penalties that allow for a reasonable period of time  typically at least days  for borrowers to refinance prior to the expiration of the initial fixed interest rate period without penalty 
the statement also reinforces the april  interagency statement on working with mortgage borrowers  in which the federal bank regulatory agencies encouraged institutions to work constructively with residential borrowers who are financially unable or reasonably expected to be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations on their home loans 
in addition  the statement referenced expanded guidance issued by the agencies by press release dated january  according to the expanded guidance  subprime loans are loans to borrowers which display one or more characteristics of reduced payment capacity 
five specific criteria  which are not intended to be exhaustive and are not meant to define specific parameters for all subprime borrowers and may not match all markets or institutions specific subprime definitions  are set forth  including having a fico credit score of or below at the time of origination 
within the bank loan portfolio  there are loans to borrowers who had fico scores of or below at the time of origination 
however  as a portfolio lender  the bank reviews all data contained in borrower credit reports and does not base underwriting decisions solely on fico scores 
the bank believes the aforementioned loans  when made  were amply collateralized and otherwise conformed to the bank prime lending standards 
these loans are not a material component of the one to four family mortgage loan portfolio 
carver federal has evaluated the guidance  the cre guidance and the statement to determine compliance and  as necessary  modified risk management practices  underwriting guidelines and consumer protection standards 
see lending activities one to four family mortgage lending and multi family and commercial real estate lending for a discussion of the bank loan product offerings and related underwriting standards and asset quality in item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information regarding the bank interest only and reduced documentation loan portfolio composition 
loans to one borrower limitations 
the bank is generally subject to the same limits on loans to one borrower as a national bank 
with specified exceptions  the bank total loans or extension of credit to a single borrower or group of related borrowers may not exceed of the bank unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus  which does not include accumulated other comprehensive income 
the bank may lend additional amounts up to of its unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus if the loans or extensions of credit are fully secured by readily marketable collateral 
the bank currently complies with applicable loans to one borrower limitations 
at march   the bank limit on loans to one borrower based on its unimpaired capital and surplus was million 
qualified thrift lender test 
under hola  the bank must comply with a qualified thrift lender qtl test 
under this test  the bank is required to maintain at least of its portfolio assets in certain qualified thrift investments on a monthly basis in at least nine months of the most recent twelve month period 
portfolio assets means  in general  an association total assets less the sum of a specified liquid assets up to of total assets  b goodwill and other intangible assets and c the value of property used to conduct the bank business 
qualified thrift investments include various types of loans made for residential and housing purposes  investments related to such purposes  including certain mortgage backed and related securities and consumer loans 
if the bank fails the qtl test  it must operate under certain restrictions on its activities 
the dodd frank act made non compliance potentially subject to agency enforcement action for violation of law 
at march   the bank maintained approximately of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments 
the bank had also met the qtl test in each of the prior months and was  therefore  a qualified thrift lender 
capital requirements 
the ots capital regulations require federally chartered savings associations to meet three minimum capital ratios a tangible capital ratio  a leverage core capital ratio and an total risk based capital ratio 
in assessing an institution capital adequacy  the ots takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors as well  and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary 
carver federal  as a matter of prudent management  targets as its goal the maintenance of capital ratios which exceed these minimum requirements and that are consistent with carver federal risk profile 
the previously described cease and desist order carver federal entered into with the ots includes a capital directive requiring the bank to achieve and maintain regulatory capital levels of a tier i core capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of by april  at march   carver federal did not achieve these capital requirements with a tangible capital ratio of  total risk based capital ratio of and a leverage capital ratio of 
the company did not raise the additional capital by april  and thus filed the required contingency plan with the ots 
if the contingency plan is acted upon it may result in the sale or unwinding of the company 
the company has submitted the requisite contingency plan to the ots and the ots has accepted this plan 
on june  the company raised million of equity 
the increase in the company and bank capital position results in the company and the bank meeting the capital directives within the orders 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act  or fdicia  requires that the ots and other federal banking agencies revise their risk based capital standards  with appropriate transition rules  to ensure that they take into account irr concentration of risk and the risks of non traditional activities 
the ots regulations do not include a specific irr component of the risk based capital requirement 
however  the ots monitors the irr of individual institutions through a variety of means  including an analysis of the change in net portfolio value  or npv 
npv is defined as the net present value of the expected future cash flows of an entity assets and liabilities and  therefore  hypothetically represents the value of an institution net worth 
the ots has also used this npv analysis as part of its evaluation of certain applications or notices submitted by thrift institutions 
in addition  ots thrift bulletin a provides guidance on the management of irr and the responsibility of boards of directors in that area 
the ots  through its general oversight of the safety and soundness of savings associations  retains the right to impose minimum capital requirements on individual institutions to the extent the institution is not in compliance with certain written guidelines established by the ots regarding npv analysis 
the ots has not imposed any such requirements on carver federal 
liquidity 
the bank maintains liquidity levels to meet operational needs 
in the normal course of business  the levels of liquid assets during any given period are dependent on operating  investing and financing activities 
cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and repurchase agreements with maturities of three months or less are the bank most liquid assets 
the bank maintains a liquidity policy to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operations 
branching 
subject to certain limitations  federal law permits the bank to establish branches in any state of the united states 
the authority for the bank to establish an interstate branch network would facilitate a geographic diversification of the bank activities 
this authority under federal law and regulations preempts any state law purporting to regulate branching by federal savings associations 
community reinvestment 
under cra  as amended  as implemented by ots regulations  the bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for the bank nor does it limit the bank discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community 
cra does  however  require the ots  in connection with its examination of the bank  to assess the bank record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the bank 
in particular  the system focuses on three tests a lending test  to evaluate the institution record of making loans in its assessment areas  an investment test  to evaluate the institution record of investing in community development projects  affordable housing and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses  and a service test  to evaluate the institution delivery of banking services through its branches  atm centers and other offices 
cra also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
the bank received an outstanding cra rating in its most recent examination conducted in regulations require that carver federal publicly disclose certain agreements that are in fulfillment of cra 
the holding company has no such agreements in place at this time 
transactions with related parties 
the bank authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates and insiders is limited by ots regulations and by sections a  b  g and h of the federal reserve act fra 
in general  these transactions must be on terms which are as favorable to the bank as comparable transactions with non affiliates 
additionally  certain types of these transactions are restricted to an aggregate percentage of the bank capital 
collateral in specified amounts must usually be provided by affiliates to receive loans from the bank 
in addition  ots regulations prohibit a savings bank from lending to any of its affiliates that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary 
in january certain directors and seniors officers of the company loaned a total of  to the company to allow the company to make the interest payment on the company trust preferred securities due in january the loan is secured by a pledge of shares of treasury stock 
the interest rate on the loan is prime plus 
the loan is expected to be repaid upon completion of the company capital raise the bank authority to extend credit to its directors  executive officers  and shareholders  as well as to entities controlled by such persons  is currently governed by the requirements of sections g and h of the fra and regulation o of the frb 
among other things  these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders a be made on terms that are substantially the same as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than  those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and b not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons  individually and in the aggregate  which limits are based  in part  on the amount of the bank capital 
in addition  extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the bank board 
at march   there were no loans to officers or directors 
the frb has confirmed its previous interpretations of sections a and b of the fra with regulation w 
the ots has also conformed its regulations to agree with regulation w 
regulation w made various changes to existing law regarding sections a and b  including expanding the definition of what constitutes an affiliate subject to sections a and b and exempting certain subsidiaries of state chartered banks from the restrictions of sections a and b 
the ots regulations provide for additional restrictions imposed on savings associations under section of hola  including provisions prohibiting a savings association from making a loan to an affiliate that is engaged in non bank holding company activities and provisions prohibiting a savings association from purchasing or investing in securities issued by an affiliate that is not a subsidiary 
the ots regulations also include certain specific exemptions from these prohibitions 
the frb and the ots expect each depository institution that is subject to sections a and b to implement policies and procedures to ensure compliance with regulation w and the ots regulation 
these regulations have had no material adverse effect on the bank business 
section of the sarbanes oxley act prohibits the extension of personal loans to directors and executive officers of issuers as defined in the sarbanes oxley act 
the prohibition  however  does not apply to mortgages advanced by an insured depository institution  such as the bank  that is subject to the insider lending restrictions of section h of the fra 
assessment 
the ots charges assessments to recover the cost of examining savings associations and their affiliates 
these assessments are based on three components the size of the association  on which the basic assessment is based  the association supervisory condition  which results in an additional assessment based on a percentage of the basic assessment for any savings institution with a composite rating of   or in its most recent safety and soundness examination  and the complexity of the association operations  which results in an additional assessment based on a percentage of the basic assessment for any savings association that managed over billion in trust assets  serviced for others loans aggregating more than billion  or had certain off balance sheet assets aggregating more than billion 
effective july   the ots adopted a final rule replacing examination fees for savings and loan holding companies with semi annual assessments 
for fiscal  carver paid million in ots assessments 
insurance of deposit accounts the fdic merged the savings association insurance fund and the bank insurance fund to create the depositors insurance fund dif on march  the bank is a member of the dif and pays its deposit insurance assessments to the dif 
effective january   the fdic established a new risk based assessment system for determining the deposit insurance assessments to be paid by insured depository institutions 
under this new assessment system  the fdic assigns an institution to one of four risk categories  with the first category having two sub categories  based on the institution most recent supervisory ratings and capital ratios 
base assessment rates range from two to four basis points for risk category i institutions and are seven basis points for risk category ii institutions  twenty five basis points for risk category iii institutions and forty basis points for risk category iv institutions 
for institutions within risk category i  assessment rates generally depend upon a combination of camels capital adequacy  asset quality  management  earnings  liquidity  sensitivity to market risk component ratings and financial ratios  or for large institutions with long term debt issuer ratings  assessment rates depend on a combination of long term debt issuer ratings and camels component ratings 
the fdic has the flexibility to adjust rates  without further notice and comment rulemaking  provided that no such adjustment can be greater than three basis points from one quarter to the next  that adjustments cannot result in rates more than three basis points above or below the base rates  and that rates cannot be negative 
the dodd frank act requires the federal deposit insurance corporation to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits 
the federal deposit insurance corporation finalized a rule that implemented that change april  among other things  the final rule changes the assessment range 
on november   the fdic issued a final rule that required insured depository institutions to prepay  on december   their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and  together with their quarterly risk based assessment for the third quarter the bank prepaid million  of which approximately million was recorded as a prepaid asset as of december  insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic 
the management of the bank does not know of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance 
as of march   the bank had an assessment rate of twenty seven basis points and the bank expense for fdic insurance payments totaled million in fiscal the fdic has authority to further increase insurance assessments and therefore management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future 
a significant increase in insurance premiums may have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the bank 
on october   in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets  the fdic announced a temporary increase in deposit insurance from  to  per depositor through december  the dodd frank act permanently raised the standard maximum deposit insurance to  on november   the fdic adopted the temporary liquidity guarantee program  or tlgp  pursuant to its authority to prevent systemic risk in the u 
s banking system 
the tlgp was announced by the fdic on october  as an initiative to counter the system wide crisis in the nation financial sector 
under the tlgp the fdic will guarantee  through the earlier of maturity or june   certain newly issued senior unsecured debt issued by participating institutions on or after october   and before june  under the debt guarantee program and fully insure non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts held at participating fdic insured institutions  through december  under the transaction account guarantee program tag 
eligible institutions were covered under the tlgp at no cost for the first days 
institutions that did not want to continue to participate in one or both parts of the tlgp were required to notify the fdic of their election to opt out on or before december  institutions that did not opt out are subject to a fee of up to basis points per annum based on the amount of senior unsecured debt issued under the debt guarantee program 
under the transaction account guarantee program  a basis point surcharge was be added to the institution current insurance assessment  quarterly  for balances in non interest bearing transaction accounts that exceed the existing deposit insurance limit of  the tlgp was due to expire in june of  however  on february  the fdic announced its intention to extend the tlgp through october for an additional premium 
on october   the bank raised million in a private placement of senior notes bearing a coupon of per annum  maturing on october  this debt is guaranteed under the tlgp 
for this guarantee  the bank is assessed a fee by the fdic in the amount of basis points 
these proceeds were used to increase the bank liquidity position and for general corporate purposes 
on april   the fdic provided under an interim final rule a one time opportunity to opt out of the tag program effective july  carver federal savings bank exercised this opportunity and opted out 
carver federal will continue to participate in the debt guarantee component of the tlgp

anti money laundering and customer identification the bank is subject to ots regulations implementing the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of usa patriot act 
the usa patriot act gives the federal government new powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures  expanded surveillance powers  increased information sharing  and broadened anti money laundering requirements 
by way of amendments to the bank secrecy act  title iii of the usa patriot act takes measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies 
further  certain provisions of title iii impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions  including banks  thrifts  brokers  dealers  credit unions  money transfer agents and parties registered under the united states commodity exchange act of  as amended

federal home loan bank system the bank is a member of the fhlb ny  which is one of the twelve regional banks composing the fhlb system 
each regional bank provides a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions 
the bank  as a fhlb ny member  is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the fhlb ny in an amount equal to the greater of i of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans  home purchase contracts and similar obligations at the beginning of each year  and ii or such greater fraction as established by the fhlb ny of its outstanding advances from the fhlb ny 
the bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in the capital stock of the fhlb ny at march  of million 
any advances from the fhlb ny must be secured by specified types of collateral  and all long term advances may be obtained only for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance 
fhlb ny is required to provide funds for the resolution of insolvent thrifts and to contribute funds for affordable housing programs 
these requirements could reduce the amount of earnings that the fhlb ny can pay as dividends to its members and could also result in the fhlb ny imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to its members 
if dividends were reduced  or interest on future fhlb ny advances increased  the bank net interest income would be adversely affected 
dividends from fhlb ny to the bank amounted to million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the dividend rate paid on fhlb ny stock at march  was 
under the gramm leach bliley act  as amended glb  which  among other things  repeals historical restrictions and eliminates many federal and state law barriers to affiliations among banks and securities firms  insurance companies and other financial service providers  membership in the fhlb system is now voluntary for all federally chartered savings banks such as the bank 
glb also replaces the existing redeemable stock structure of the fhlb system with a capital structure that requires each fhlb to meet a leverage limit and a risk based permanent capital requirement 
two classes of stock are authorized class a redeemable on six months notice and class b redeemable on five years notice 
pursuant to regulations promulgated by the federal housing finance board  as required by glb  the fhlb has adopted a capital plan that will change the foregoing minimum stock ownership requirements for fhlb stock 
under the new capital plan  each member of the fhlb will have to maintain a minimum investment in fhlb capital stock in an amount equal to the sum of the greater of  or of the member mortgage related assets and of the dollar amount of any outstanding advances under such member advances  collateral pledge and security agreement with the fhlb ny 
federal reserve system frb regulations require federally chartered savings associations to maintain non interest earning cash reserves against their transaction accounts primarily now and demand deposit accounts 
a reserve of is to be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts between million and million subject to adjustment by the frb plus a reserve of subject to adjustment by the frb between and against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of million 
the first million of otherwise reservable balances subject to adjustment by the frb is exempt from the reserve requirements 
the bank is in compliance with the foregoing requirements 
since required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash  a non interest bearing account at a federal reserve bank or a pass through account as defined by the frb  the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce carver federal interest earning assets 
fhlb system members are also authorized to borrow from the federal reserve discount window  but frb regulations require institutions to exhaust all fhlb sources before borrowing from a federal reserve bank 
pursuant to the eesa  the frb announced on october   that the federal reserve banks will begin to pay interest on depository institutions required and excess reserve balances 
paying interest on required reserve balances should essentially eliminate the opportunity cost of holding required reserves  promoting efficiency in the banking sector 
the interest rate paid on required reserve balances is currently the average target federal funds rate over the reserve maintenance period 
the rate on excess balances will be set equal to the lowest target federal funds rate in effect during the reserve maintenance period 
the payment of interest on excess reserves will permit the federal reserve to expand its balance sheet as necessary to provide the liquidity necessary to support financial stability 
privacy protection carver federal is subject to ots regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of glb 
these regulations require the bank to disclose its privacy policy  including identifying with whom it shares nonpublic personal information  to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter 
the regulations also require the bank to provide its customers with initial and annual notices that accurately reflect its privacy policies and practices 
in addition  to the extent its sharing of such information is not exempted  the bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to opt out of having the bank share their nonpublic personal information with unaffiliated third parties before they can disclose such information  subject to certain exceptions 
the bank is subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information 
these regulations implement certain provisions of glb 
the guidelines describe the agencies expectations for the creation  implementation and maintenance of an information security program  which would include administrative  technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities 
the standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to insure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information  protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer 
the bank has a policy to comply with the foregoing guidelines 
holding company regulation 
the holding company is a savings and loan holding company regulated by the ots 
as such  the holding company is registered with and is subject to ots examination and supervision  as well as certain reporting requirements 
in addition  the ots has enforcement authority over the holding company and its subsidiaries 
among other things  this authority permits the ots to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of a subsidiary savings institution 
the dodd frank act transfers the responsibility for that regulation and supervision of savings and loan holding companies to the federal reserve board effective july  glb restricts the powers of new unitary savings and loan holding companies 
unitary savings and loan holding companies that are grandfathered  ie  unitary savings and loan holding companies in existence or with applications filed with the ots on or before may   such as the holding company  retain their authority under the prior law 
all other unitary savings and loan holding companies are limited to financially related activities permissible for bank holding companies  as defined under glb 
glb also prohibits non financial companies from acquiring grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding companies 
restrictions applicable to all savings and loan holding companies 
federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company  including the holding company  directly or indirectly  from acquiring control as defined under hola of another savings institution or a holding company parent without prior ots approval  through merger  consolidation  or purchase of assets  another savings institution or a holding company thereof  or acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of such institution or a holding company  without prior ots approval  or control of any depository institution not insured by the fdic except through a merger with and into the holding company savings institution subsidiary that is approved by the ots 
a savings and loan holding company may not acquire as a separate subsidiary an insured institution that has a principal office outside of the state where the principal office of its subsidiary institution is located  except in the case of certain emergency acquisitions approved by the fdic  if such holding company controls a savings institution subsidiary that operated a home or branch office in such additional state as of march   or if the laws of the state in which the savings institution to be acquired is located specifically authorize a savings institution chartered by that state to be acquired by a savings institution chartered by the state where the acquiring savings institution or savings and loan holding company is located or by a holding company that controls such a state chartered association 
the hola prohibits a savings and loan holding company directly or indirectly  or through one or more subsidiaries from acquiring another savings association or holding company thereof without prior written approval of the ots  acquiring or retaining  with certain exceptions  more than of a non subsidiary savings association  a non subsidiary holding company  or a non subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by the hola  or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not federally insured 
in evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings associations  the ots must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved  the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds  the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors 
savings and loan holding companies are not currently subject to specific regulatory capital requirements 
the dodd frank act  however  requires the federal reserve board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent  both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital  than those applicable to institutions themselves 
instruments such as cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities will no longer be includable as tier capital  as is currently the case with bank holding companies 
instruments issued by may  will be grandfathered for companies with consolidated assets of billion or less 
there is a five year transition period from the july  effective date of the dodd frank act before the capital requirements will apply to savings and loan holding companies 
the dodd frank act also extends the source of strength doctrine to savings and loan holding companies 
the regulatory agencies must issue regulations requiring that all bank and savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital  liquidity and other support in times of financial stress 
federal securities laws the holding company is subject to the periodic reporting  proxy solicitation  tender offer  insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the securities exchange act of  as amended exchange act 
delaware corporation law the holding company is incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware 
thus  it is subject to regulation by the state of delaware and the rights of its shareholders are governed by the general corporation law of the state of delaware 
federal and state taxation federal taxation general 
the holding company and the bank currently file consolidated federal income tax returns  report their income for tax return purposes on the basis of a taxable year ending march st  using the accrual method of accounting and are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions  including in particular the bank tax reserve for bad debts discussed below 
the following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the bank or the holding company 
bad debt reserves 
prior to fiscal  the bank met the requirement as a small bank one with assets having an adjusted tax basis of million or less and was permitted to maintain a reserve for bad debts  and to make  within specified formula limits  annual additions to the reserve which are deductible for purposes of computing the bank taxable income 
since fiscal year  the bank has not been considered to be a small bank because its total assets have exceeded million 
see income taxes note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
distributions 
to the extent that the bank makes non dividend distributions to shareholders  such distributions will be considered to result in distributions from the bank base year reserve  ie  its reserve as of march   to the extent thereof and then from its supplemental reserve for losses on loans  and an amount based on the amount distributed will be included in the bank taxable income 
non dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the bank current and accumulated earnings and profits  distributions in redemption of stock and distributions in partial or complete liquidation 
however  dividends paid out of the bank current or accumulated earnings and profits  as calculated for federal income tax purposes  will not constitute non dividend distributions and  therefore  will not be included in the bank taxable income 
the amount of additional taxable income created from a non dividend distribution is an amount that  when reduced by the tax attributable to the income  is equal to the amount of the distribution 
thus  approximately one and one half times the non dividend distribution would be includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes  assuming a federal corporate income tax rate 
dividends received deduction and other matters 
the holding company may exclude from its income of dividends received from the bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations 
the corporate dividends received deduction is generally in the case of dividends received from unaffiliated corporations with which the holding company and the bank will not file a consolidated tax return  except that if the holding company or the bank owns more than of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend  then of any dividends received may be deducted 
state and local taxation state of new york 
the bank and the holding company file on a combined basis and are subject to new york state franchise tax on their entire net income or one of several alternative bases  whichever results in the highest tax 
entire net income means federal taxable income with adjustments 
if  however  the application of an alternative tax based on taxable assets allocated to new york  alternative entire net income or a fixed minimum fee results in a greater tax  an alternative tax will be imposed 
the company was subject to tax based upon assets for new york state for fiscal in addition  new york state imposes a tax surcharge of of the new york state franchise tax allocable to business activities carried on in the metropolitan commuter transportation district 
for fiscal  the new york state franchise tax rate computed on taxable assets was 
including the metropolitan commuter transportation district surcharge 
new york state has enacted legislation that enabled the bank to avoid the recapture of the new york state tax bad debt reserves that otherwise would have occurred as a result of the changes in federal law and to continue to utilize either the federal method or a method based on a percentage of its taxable income for computing additions to its bad debt reserve 
new york city 
the bank and the holding company file on a combined bases and are also subject to a similarly calculated new york city banking corporation tax on assets allocated to new york city 
for fiscal  the new york city banking corporation tax rate computed on taxable assets is 
delaware taxation 
as a delaware holding company not earning income in delaware  the holding company is exempted from delaware corporate income tax but is required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the state of delaware

item a 
risk factors 
risk is an inherent part of carver business and activities 
the following is a summary of risk factors relevant to the company operations which should be carefully reviewed 
these risk factors do not necessarily appear in the order of importance 
the prolonged negative effect of the recession and weak economic recovery will continue to adversely affect our financial performance the severe recession and weak economic recovery has resulted in continued uncertainty in the financial and credit markets in general 
there is also continued concern about the possibility of another economic downturn 
the federal reserve  in an attempt to stimulate the overall economy  has  among other things  kept interest rates low through its targeted federal funds rate and purchased mortgage backed securities 
if the federal reserve increases the federal funds rate  overall interest rates will likely rise which may negatively impact the housing markets and the us economic recovery 
a prolonged weakness in the economy generally  and in the financial services industry in particular  could continue to negatively affect our operations by causing a continued deterioration of our loan portfolio and an increase in our provision for loan losses which would adversely affect our ability to originate loans 
the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse impact on the company financial performance 
carver results of operations are affected by economic conditions in the new york metropolitan area 
at march   a significant majority of the bank lending portfolio was concentrated in the new york metropolitan area 
as a result of this geographic concentration  carver results of operations are largely dependent on economic conditions in this area 
further decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans to its borrowers 
adverse changes in the economy caused by inflation  recession  unemployment or other factors beyond the bank control may also continue to have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely mortgage or business loan payments  which would have an adverse impact on earnings 
consequently  deterioration in economic conditions in the new york metropolitan area could have a material adverse impact on the quality of the bank loan portfolio  which could result in increased delinquencies  decreased interest income results as well as an adverse impact on loan loss experience with probable increased allowance for loan losses 
such deterioration also could adversely impact the demand for products and services  and  accordingly  further negatively affect results of operations 
the bank is operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment  both nationally and locally 
financial institutions continue to be affected by sharp declines in the real estate market and constrained financial markets 
continued declines in real estate values  home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the ongoing economic recession  including job losses  could have an adverse effect on the bank borrowers or their customers  which could adversely affect the bank financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans 
however  no assurance can be given that the original appraised values are reflective of current market conditions as the bank has experienced declines in real estate values in all markets in which it lends 
the bank has experienced increases in loan delinquencies and charge offs in fiscal march  the bank non performing loans  which are comprised primarily of construction and mortgage loans  increased million to million  or of total loans  at march   from million  or of total loans  at march  the bank net loan charge offs totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the bank provision for loan losses totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a residential lender  carver federal is particularly vulnerable to the impact of a severe job loss recession 
significant increases in job losses and unemployment will have a negative impact on the financial condition of residential borrowers and their ability to remain current on their mortgage loans 
a continuation or further deterioration in national and local economic conditions  including an accelerating pace of job losses  particularly in the new york metropolitan area  could have a material adverse impact on the quality of the bank loan portfolio  which could result in further increases in loan delinquencies  causing a decrease in the bank interest income as well as an adverse impact on the bank loan loss experience  causing an increase in the bank allowance for loan losses and related provision and a decrease in net income 
such deterioration could also adversely impact the demand for the bank products and services  and  accordingly  the bank results of operations 
no assurance can be given that these conditions will improve or will not worsen or that such conditions will not result in a decrease in the bank interest income or an adverse impact on loan losses 
our business may be adversely affected by current conditions in the financial markets  the real estate market and economic conditions generally beginning in the latter half of and continuing into  negative developments in the capital markets resulted in uncertainty and instability in the financial markets  and an economic downturn 
the housing market declined  resulting in decreasing home prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures 
the credit performance of residential and commercial real estate  construction and land loans resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks 
the declines in the performance and value of mortgage assets encompassed all mortgage and real estate asset types  leveraged bank loans and nearly all other asset classes  including equity securities 
these write downs have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital or to merge with larger and stronger institutions 
some financial institutions have failed 
continued  and potentially increased  volatility  instability and weakness could affect our ability to sell investment securities and other financial assets  which in turn could adversely affect our liquidity and financial position 
this instability also could affect the prices at which we could make any such sales  which could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy have resulted in decreased lending by some financial institutions to their customers and to each other 
this tightening of credit has led to increased loan delinquencies  lack of customer confidence  increased market volatility and a widespread reduction in general business activity 
competition among depository institutions for deposits has increased significantly  and access to deposits or borrowed funds has decreased for many institutions 
it has also become more difficult to assess the creditworthiness of customers and to estimate the losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
current conditions  including high unemployment  soft real estate markets  and the decline of home sales and property values  could negatively affect the volume of loan originations and prepayments  the value of the real estate securing our mortgage loans  and borrowers ability to repay loan obligations  all of which could adversely impact our earnings and financial condition 
business activity across a wide range of industries and regions is greatly reduced  and local governments and many companies are in serious difficulty due to the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
a worsening of current conditions would likely adversely affect our business and results of operations  as well as those of our customers 
as a result  we may experience increased foreclosures  delinquencies and customer bankruptcies  as well as more restricted access to funds 
the soundness of other financial institutions could negatively affect us 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more financial services institutions  or the financial services industry generally  have led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover carver actual loan losses 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience  and we evaluate economic conditions 
if our assumptions are incorrect  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  resulting in additions to our allowance 
material additions to the allowance would materially decrease net income 
in addition  the ots periodically reviews the allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs 
a material increase in the allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by the regulatory authorities would have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition and results of operations 
carver concentration in multifamily loans  commercial real estate loans  and construction loans could  in a deteriorating economic climate  expose the company to increased lending risks and related loan losses 
carver current business strategy is to decrease the bank exposure to non owner occupied commercial real estate loans and construction loans 
execution of this strategy will involve the company temporarily ceasing new originations of these types of loan products  which often have a higher interest rate than other types of loans  including residential lending 
as a result  our ability to generate sufficient net interest margin is lessened which would have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition and results of operations 
changes in interest rate environment may negatively affect carver net income  mortgage loan originations and valuation of available for sale securities 
the company earnings depend largely on the relationship between the yield on interest earning assets  primarily mortgage  construction and business loans and mortgage backed securities  and the cost of deposits and borrowings 
this relationship  known as the interest rate spread  is subject to fluctuation and is affected by economic and competitive factors which influence market interest rates  the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of non performing assets 
fluctuations in market interest rates affect customer demand for products and services 
carver is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than its interest earning assets 
in addition  the actual amount of time before mortgage  construction and business loans and mortgage backed securities are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in mortgage prepayment rates and prevailing market interest rates 
mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors  including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated  seasonal factors  demographic variables and the ability to assume the underlying mortgages 
however  the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates  related loan refinancing opportunities and competition 
the company objective is to fund its liquidity needs primarily through lower costing deposit growth 
however  from time to time carver federal borrows from the fhlb ny 
more recently  the cost of deposits and borrowings have become significantly higher with the rising interest rate environment  which has negatively impacted net interest income 
interest rates do and will continue to fluctuate 
the federal open market committee  or fomc  reduced the federal funds rate by basis points during the second half of and then an additional basis points during bringing the target rate to to 
at june  the fomc target rate remains at 
the bank cannot predict future fomc or frb actions or other factors that will cause rates to change 
no assurance can be given that further changes in interest rates or further increases in mortgage loan prepayments will not have a negative impact on net interest income  net interest rate spread or net interest margin 
the estimated fair value of the company available for sale securities portfolio may increase or decrease depending on changes in interest rates 
carver federal securities portfolio is comprised primarily of adjustable rate securities 
strong competition within the bank market areas could adversely affect profits and slow growth the new york metropolitan area has a high density of financial institutions  of which many are significantly larger than carver federal and with greater financial resources 
additionally  various large out of state financial institutions may continue to enter the new york metropolitan area market 
all are considered competitors to varying degrees 
carver federal faces intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits 
competition for loans  both locally and in the aggregate  comes principally from mortgage banking companies  commercial banks  savings banks and savings and loan associations 
most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan associations and credit unions 
the bank also faces competition for deposits from money market mutual funds and other corporate and government securities funds as well as from other financial intermediaries such as brokerage firms and insurance companies 
market area competition is a factor in pricing the bank loans and deposits  which could reduce net interest income 
competition also makes it more challenging to effectively grow loan and deposit balances 
the company profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in its market areas 
controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented  which may result in a material adverse effect on the company business management regularly reviews and updates the company internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on carver business  results of operations and financial condition 
the bank operates in a highly regulated industry  which limits the manner and scope of business activities 
carver federal is subject to extensive supervision  regulation and examination by the ots  the fdic  and  to a lesser extent  by the new york state banking department 
as a result  the bank is limited in the manner in which the bank conducts its business  undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing 
this regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and depositors  and not to benefit the holding company stockholders 
this regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to capital levels  the timing and amount of dividend payments  the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
in addition  the bank must comply with significant anti money laundering and anti terrorism laws 
government agencies have substantial discretion to impose significant monetary penalties on institutions which fail to comply with these laws 
on october   the ots and other federal bank regulatory authorities published the interagency guidance on nontraditional mortgage product risk  or the guidance 
in general  the guidance applies to all residential mortgage loan products that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal or interest 
the guidance describes sound practices for managing risk  as well as marketing  originating and servicing nontraditional mortgage products  which include  among other things  interest only loans 
the guidance sets forth supervisory expectations with respect to loan terms and underwriting standards  portfolio and risk management practices and consumer protection 
for example  the guidance indicates that originating interest only loans with reduced documentation is considered a layering of risk and that institutions are expected to demonstrate mitigating factors to support their underwriting decision and the borrower repayment capacity 
specifically  the guidance indicates that a lender may accept a borrower statement as to the borrower income without obtaining verification only if there are mitigating factors that clearly minimize the need for direct verification of repayment capacity and that  for many borrowers  institutions should be able to readily document income 
the bank has evaluated the guidance for compliance  risk management practices and underwriting guidelines as they relate to originations and purchases of the subject loans  or practices relating to communications with consumers 
the guidance has no impact on the company loan origination and purchase volumes or the company underwriting procedures currently or in future periods 
changes in laws  government regulation and monetary policy may have a material effect on results of operations financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future  none of which is in the company control 
significant new laws or changes in  or repeals of  existing laws  including with respect to federal and state taxation  may cause results of operations to differ materially 
in addition  cost of compliance could adversely affect carver ability to operate profitably 
further  federal monetary policy significantly affects credit conditions for carver federal  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system 
a material change in any of these conditions could have a material impact on carver federal  and therefore on the company results of operations 
on october   president bush signed the eesa into law in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets 
pursuant to the eesa  the us treasury has the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of troubled assets including mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
on october   the us treasury  the frb and the fdic issued a joint statement announcing additional steps aimed at stabilizing the financial markets 
first  the us treasury announced the tarp cpp  a billion voluntary capital purchase program available to qualifying financial institutions that sell preferred shares to the us treasury to be funded from the billion authorized for troubled asset purchases 
second  the fdic announced that its board of directors  under the authority to prevent systemic risk in the us banking system  approved the tlgp  which is intended to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by permitting the fdic to guarantee certain newly issued senior unsecured debt issued by participating institutions under the debt guarantee program and fully insure non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts held at participating fdic insured institutions  regardless of dollar amount  under the transaction account guarantee program 
third  to further increase access to funding for businesses in all sectors of the economy  the frb announced further details of its commercial paper funding facility  or cpff  which provides a broad backstop for the commercial paper market 
the company currently participates in the tarp cdci 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the actual impact that the foregoing or any other governmental program will have on the financial markets 
the failure of any such program or the us government to stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions and the national and regional economy is expected to materially and adversely affect the company business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit and the trading price of the holding company common stock 
pursuant to carver participation in the tarp cpp and subsequent conversion to cdci  the company entered into certain agreements with the treasury that limit the company activities in a number of ways and that give the treasury the ability to impose additional restrictions as it determines 
for example  the company ability to declare or pay dividends on any of carver shares is restricted 
specifically  the company is not able to declare dividends payments on common  junior preferred or pari passu preferred shares if it is in arrears on the dividends on the senior preferred shares issued to the treasury 
further  the company is not permitted to increase dividends on common stock without the treasury approval until the third anniversary of the investment unless the senior preferred stock issued to the treasury has been redeemed or transferred 
in addition  the company ability to repurchase shares of common stock is prohibited without the treasury prior consent until the third anniversary of the investment or until the senior preferred stock issued to the treasury has been redeemed or transferred 
further  common  junior preferred or pari passu preferred shares may not be repurchased if the company is in arrears on the dividends on the senior preferred shares issued to the treasury 
in addition  the company must also adopt the treasury standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the treasury holds equity issued under this program 
these standards would generally apply to the company ceo  cfo and the three next most highly compensated officers senior executive 
the standards include ensuring that incentive compensation for senior executives does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution  required claw back of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive based on statements of earnings  gains or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate  prohibition on making golden parachute payments to senior executives  and agreement not to deduct for tax purposes executive compensation in excess of  for each senior executive 
in particular  the change to the deductibility limit on executive compensation would likely increase slightly the overall cost of the company compensation programs 
on july   the president signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act implements significant changes in the financial regulatory landscape and will impact all financial institutions 
this impact may materially affect our business activities  financial position and profitability by  among other things 
increasing our regulatory compliance burden and associated costs  placing restrictions on certain products and services  and limiting our future capital raising strategies 
among the dodd frank act s significant regulatory changes  it creates a new financial consumer protection agency  known as the bureau of consumer financial protection the bureau  that is empowered to promulgate new consumer protection regulations and revise existing regulations in many areas of consumer protection 
the bureau has exclusive authority to issue regulations  orders and guidance to administer and implement the objectives of federal consumer protection laws 
the dodd frank act also eliminates our primary regulator  the ots and designates the comptroller of the currency to become our primary bank regulator 
moreover  the dodd frank act permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and authorizes state attorney generals to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the bureau 
the dodd frank act also may affect the preemption of state laws as they affect subsidiaries and agents of federally chartered banks  changes the scope of federal deposit insurance coverage  and increases the fdic assessment payable by the bank 
we expect that the bureau and these other changes will significantly increase our regulatory compliance burden and costs and may restrict the financial products and services we offer to our customers 
the dodd frank act also imposes more stringent capital requirements on bank holding companies by  among other things  imposing leverage ratios on bank holding companies and prohibiting new trust preferred issuances from counting as tier i capital 
these restrictions will limit our future capital strategies 
under the dodd frank act  our outstanding trust preferred securities will continue to count as tier i capital but we will be unable to issue replacement or additional trust preferred securities that would count as tier i capital 
because many of the dodd frank act s provisions require subsequent regulatory rulemaking  we are uncertain as to the impact that some of the provisions will have on the company and cannot provide assurance that the dodd frank act will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for other reasons 
management expects to face increased regulation and supervision of the banking industry as a result of the existing financial crisis  and there will be additional requirements and conditions imposed on the company to the extent that it participates in any of the programs established or to be established by the treasury or by the federal bank regulatory agencies 
such additional regulation and supervision may increase the company costs and limit the company ability to pursue business opportunities 
future federal deposit insurance corporation assessments will hurt our earnings in may  the federal deposit insurance corporation adopted a final rule imposing a special assessment on all insured institutions due to recent bank and savings association failures 
the emergency assessment amounts to basis points of total assets minus tier capital as of june  we recorded an expense of million during the quarter ended june   to reflect the special assessment 
the assessment was collected on september  and was recorded against earnings for the quarter ended june  the special assessment negatively impacted the company earnings for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   as a result of this special assessment 
in november  the fdic issued a rule that required all insured depository institutions  with limited exceptions  to prepay their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and the fdic also adopted a uniform three basis point increase in assessment rates effective on january  any additional emergency special assessment or increases in insurance premiums imposed by the fdic will likely negatively impact the company earnings 
the company is subject to certain risks with respect to liquidity liquidity refers to the company ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support operations and to fulfill obligations  including commitments to originate loans  to repay wholesale borrowings  and to satisfy the withdrawal of deposits by customers 
the company primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated through the repayment of loans and securities  cash flows from the sale of loans and securities  deposits gathered organically through the bank branch network  from socially motivated depositors  city and state agencies and deposit brokers  and borrowed funds  primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings from the fhlb ny 
in addition  and depending on current market conditions  the company has the ability to access the capital markets from time to time 
deposit flows  calls of investment securities and wholesale borrowings  and prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities are strongly influenced by such external factors as the direction of interest rates  whether actual or perceived  local and national economic conditions  and competition for deposits and loans in the markets the bank serves 
furthermore  changes to the fhlb ny underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings may limit or restrict the bank ability to borrow  and could therefore have a significant adverse impact on liquidity 
a decline in available funding could adversely impact the bank ability to originate loans  invest in securities  and meet expenses  or to fulfill such obligations as repaying borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands 
the bank ability to pay dividends or lend funds to the holding company is subject to regulatory limitations which may prevent the holding company from making future dividend payments or principal and interest payments on its debt obligation carver is a unitary savings and loan association holding company regulated by the ots and almost all of its operating assets are owned by carver federal 
carver relies primarily on dividends from the bank to pay cash dividends to its stockholders  to engage in share repurchase programs and to pay principal and interest on its trust preferred debt obligation 
the ots regulates all capital distributions by the bank to the company  including dividend payments 
as the subsidiary of a savings and loan association holding company  carver federal must file a notice or an application depending on the proposed dividend amount with the ots prior to each capital distribution 
the ots will disallow any proposed dividend that would result in failure to meet the ots minimum capital requirements 
based on carver federal current financial condition  it is not expected that this provision will have any impact on the company receipt of dividends from the bank although it is possible 
payment of dividends by carver federal also may be restricted at any time  at the discretion of the ots  if it deems the payment to constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
pursuant to carver participation in the tarp cdci  the company entered into certain agreements with the treasury that limit the company activities in a number of ways and that give the treasury the ability to impose additional restrictions as it determines 
for example  the company ability to declare or pay dividends on any of the holding company shares is restricted 
specifically  the company is not able to declare dividends payments on common  junior preferred or pari passu preferred shares if it is in arrears on the dividends on the senior preferred shares issued to the treasury 
further  the company is not permitted to increase dividends on common stock without the treasury approval until the third anniversary of the investment unless the senior preferred stock issued to the treasury has been redeemed or transferred 
in addition  the company ability to repurchase shares of common stock is prohibited without the treasury prior consent until the third anniversary of the investment or until the senior preferred stock issued to the treasury has been redeemed or transferred 
further  common  junior preferred or pari passu preferred shares may not be repurchased if the company is in arrears on the dividends on the senior preferred shares issued to the treasury 
carver may not be able to utilize its income tax benefits the company ability to utilize the deferred tax asset generated by new markets tax credit income tax benefits as well as other deferred tax assets depends on its ability to meet the nmtc compliance requirements and its ability to generate sufficient taxable income from operations to generate taxable income in the future 
since the bank has not generated sufficient taxable income to utilize tax credits as they were earned  a deferred tax asset has been recorded in the company financial statements 
for additional information regarding carver nmtc  refer to item  new markets tax credit award 
the future recognition of carver deferred tax asset is highly dependent upon carver ability to generate sufficient taxable income 
a valuation allowance is required to be maintained for any deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely than not to be unrealizable  based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made 
in assessing carver need for a valuation allowance  we rely upon estimates of future taxable income 
although we use the best available information to estimate future taxable income  underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances influencing our projections 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws  statutory rates  and future taxable income levels 
the company determined that it would not be able to realize all of its net deferred tax assets in the future  as such a charge to income tax expense in the second quarter of fiscal was made 
conversely  if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  the company would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease in income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made 
on june   the company raised million of equity 
the capital raise may trigger a change in control under section of the internal revenue code 
generally  section limits the utilization of an entity net operating loss carry forwards and general business credits upon a change in control 
if the change in control is triggered  it could result in a loss of deductibility of a portion of the company deferred tax asset 
carver faces system failure risks and security risks 
the computer systems and network infrastructure the company and its third party service providers use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems 
fire  power loss or other failures may effect carver computer equipment and other technology  or that of the company third party service providers 
also  the company computer systems and network infrastructure could be damaged by hacking and identity theft which could adversely affect the results of carver operations  or that of the company third party service providers 
the company business could suffer if it fails to retain skilled people the company success depends on its ability to attract and retain key employees reflecting current market opportunities and challenges 
competition for the best people is intense  and the company size and limited resources may present additional challenges in being able to retain the best possible employees  which could adversely affect the results of operations 
a natural disaster could harm carver business 
natural disasters could harm the company operations directly through interference with communications  as well as through the destruction of facilities and financial information systems 
such disasters may also have an impact on collateral underlying the bank loans 
the company may face higher insurance costs in the event of such disasters 
the company compliance with the orders the orders required the additional capital to be raised by april  or the company would be required to submit a contingency plan that is acceptable to the ots 
the company did not raise the additional capital by april  and thus filed the required contingency plan with the ots 
the contingency plan consists of the engagement of a reputable investment banker to sell the company should that fail  after consultation with the ots  the bank would voluntarily dissolve 
if the contingency plan is acted upon it may result in the sale or unwinding of the company 
the orders also require the company to reduce its level of problem assets  adhere to limits on concentrations in assets and place restrictions on growth in assets and changes in directors and management 
our common stock may be delisted as a result of our not meeting the nasdaq continued listing requirements as reported in an k filed april   on march  the company received a letter from the nasdaq stock market stating that the company is not in compliance with the nasdaq listing rule requiring securities listed on the nasdaq global market maintain a minimum market value of publicly held shares of million 
the company has until september  to regain compliance with respect to the minimum market value of publicly held shares of million 
in the event the company is not able to regain compliance  the company may consider applying to transfer to the nasdaq capital market which has a lower minimum market value of publicly held shares of million  among other requirements 
as reported in an k filed april   on april  the company received a letter from the nasdaq stock market stating that the company is not in compliance with the nasdaq listing rule requiring securities listed on the nasdaq global market maintain a minimum bid price of per share

from time to time  carver federal is a party to various legal proceedings incident to its business 
certain claims  suits  complaints and investigations collectively proceeding involving carver federal  arising in the ordinary course of business  have been filed or are pending 
the company is unable at this time to determine the ultimate outcome of each proceeding  but believes  after discussions with legal counsel representing carver federal in these proceedings  that it has meritorious defenses to each proceeding and carver federal is taking appropriate measures to defend its interests

the following table shows the high and low per share sales prices of the common stock and the dividends declared for the quarters indicated 
high low dividend high low dividend fiscal year fiscal year june  june  september  september  december  december  march  march  as previously disclosed in a form k filed with the sec on october   the company s board of directors announced that  based on highly uncertain economic conditions and the desire to preserve capital  carver was suspending payment of the quarterly cash dividend on its common stock 
the previously described cease and desist order carver federal entered into with the ots  the bank and company are also prohibited from paying any dividends without prior ots approval  and  as such  have suspended the regularly quarterly cash dividend payments on the company fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued under the capital purchase program to the united states department of treasury and have deferred carver statutory trust i debenture interest payments 
there are no assurances that the payments of dividends will resume 
under ots regulations  the bank will not be permitted to pay dividends to the holding company on its capital stock if its regulatory capital would be reduced below applicable regulatory capital requirements or if its stockholders equity would be reduced below the amount required to be maintained for the liquidation account  which was established in connection with the bank conversion to stock form 
the ots capital distribution regulations applicable to savings institutions such as the bank that meet their regulatory capital requirements permit  after not less than days prior notice to the ots  capital distributions during a calendar year that do not exceed the bank net income for that year plus its retained net income for the prior two years 
since the bank incurred a net loss in fiscal  prior approval of the ots is required for any capital distribution to the holding company 
for information concerning the bank liquidation account  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
unlike the bank  the holding company is not subject to ots regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends to its stockholders  although the source of such dividends is dependent  primarily  upon capital distributions from the bank 
the holding company is subject to the requirements of delaware law  which generally limit dividends to an amount equal to the excess of the net assets of the company the amount by which total assets exceed total liabilities over its statutory capital  or if there is no such excess  to its net profits for the current and or immediately preceding fiscal year

na not applicable item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
the company results of operations are significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies  changes in accounting standards and actions of regulatory agencies 
executive summary the financial services industry continues to face unprecedented challenges in the face of the current national and global economic crisis 
the global and us economies are experiencing significantly reduced business activity as a result of among other factors  disruptions in the financial system 
dramatic declines in the housing market coupled with high unemployment rates  have resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks 
these write downs  initially of mortgage backed securities spread to credit default swaps and other derivative securities  and caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with larger and stronger institutions  and  in some cases  to fail 
the company is fortunate that while it has been adversely affected by the weaker economic and financial market conditions  the markets it serves have been impacted to a lesser extent than many areas around the country 
in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets  there were several federal programs designed to purchase assets from  provide equity capital to  and guarantee the liquidity of the industry 
on january   the company announced that it completed the sale of million in preferred stock to the treasury in connection with carver participation in the tarp cpp 
importantly  carver is exempt from the requirement to issue a warrant to the treasury to purchase shares of common stock  as the bank is a certified community development financial institution cdfi  conducting most of its depository and lending activities in disadvantaged communities 
therefore the investment will not dilute current common stock stockholders 
carver issued  shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a  with a liquidation preference of  per share 
the preferred stock investment represents approximately of carver risk weighted assets as of march  the bank capital ratios exceed minimum regulatory capital requirements 
the treasury investment substantially increased the bank capital ratios producing a tangible capital ratio of  core capital ratio of  and risk based capital ratio of 
the bank used the funds from tarp cpp to increase its securities and loan portfolios 
in february  the united states us treasury announced the creation of the community development capital initiative cdci  in recognition of the unique role of community development financial institutions cdfi as lenders in disadvantaged communities 
cdfi that are participants in the trouble asset relief program capital purchase program tarp cpp  may apply to exchange existing tarp cpp for cdci capital 
carver received final approval of its application by the us treasury in august and exchanged its shares 
this exchange of capital will decrease carver dividend payments by thousand annually as the coupon rate declined from to and the term was extended from additional years to seven from issuance 
fiscal was a challenging year for carver as it reported a net loss of million as compared to a net loss of million in fiscal the losses for both periods are due primarily to a higher provision for loan losses and an million valuation allowance recorded against the company deferred tax asset 
the increased provision for loan losses recorded during fiscal reflects the increase in and composition of loan delinquencies  non performing loans  net loan charge offs and overall loan portfolio  as well as evaluation of the continued deterioration of the housing and real estate markets and increasing weakness in the overall economy  particularly the accelerating pace of job losses 
at march  non performing loans represent of total loans as compared to at march  net interest income was million lower than the prior year with a net interest margin decrease of basis points to 
during fiscal overall interest rates declined  however the bank was able to take advantage of its favorable asset liability position by matching the reduction in the yield on its interest earning assets with a reduction in its costs of interest bearing deposits 
as interest rates declined  the bank has benefited from the repricing of cd maturities and borrowings at significantly lower rates of interest more than offsetting the effect of the decline in the yields on loans and securities 
the business climate continues to present significant challenges 
carver federal expects a continued decline in loan balances in fiscal as economic conditions continue to strain small business community and regulatory limitation on bank exposure to commercial real estate reduces the company ability to pursue opportunities for new lending 
under the orders the bank has ceased all originations of commercial real estate cre including construction and multi family loans and it is focused on portfolio management  loan monitoring and the resolution of criticized and classified loans 
the bank expects core deposit growth in fiscal  particularly as the intense competition for core community deposits which the bank experienced in prior years has abated 
carver federal intends to continue to focus on cost control 
carver federal continues to be impacted by expenses related to the managing the non performing assets and higher fdic insurance and regulatory costs 
new markets tax credit award in june  carver federal was selected by the us department of treasury  in a highly competitive process  to receive an award of million in new markets tax credits 
the nmtc award is used to stimulate economic development in low to moderate income communities 
the nmtc award enables the bank to invest with community and development partners in economic development projects with attractive terms including  in some cases  below market interest rates  which may have the effect of attracting capital to underserved communities and facilitating the revitalization of the community  pursuant to the goals of the nmtc program 
the nmtc award provides a credit to carver federal against federal income taxes when the bank makes qualified investments 
the credits are allocated over seven years from the time of the qualified investment 
recognition of the bank million nmtc award began in december when the bank invested million  one half of its million award 
in december  the bank invested an additional million and transferred rights to million to an investor in a nmtc project 
the bank nmtc allocation was fully invested as of december  in december  the company divested its interest in the remaining million nmtc tax credits that it would have received through the period ending march   by exchanging its equity interests in the special purpose entities holding the qualified investments for a cash payment of million from a special purposes entity  controlled by an unrelated investor  set up to acquire these equity interests 
ccdc continues to provide certain administrative services to the special purpose entity that acquired the equity interests 
in addition  carver still provides the funding to the underlying projects 
the million investor equity is classified as non controlling interest in the statement of financial condition 
in may  the bank received an additional award of million in nmtc 
in december  the bank transferred rights to an investor in a nmtc project totaling million and recognized a gain on the transfer of rights of million 
the bank and ccdc have involvements with special purpose entities that were created to facilitate the ultimate investment made by the investor 
specifically  the bank has funded  on a secured basis  million of the investor million investment in the nmtc project 
in addition  ccdc has retained a interest in another entity created to facilitate the investment with the investor owning the remaining 
ccdc also provides certain administrative services to these special purpose entities 
the bank has determined that it and ccdc do not have the sole power to direct activities of these special purpose entities that significantly impact their performance therefore it is not the primary beneficiary of these entities 
in march  the bank transferred rights to investors in nmtc projects totaling million and recognized a gain on the transfer of rights of million 
the bank and ccdc have involvements with special purpose entities that were created to facilitate the ultimate investments to be made by the investor 
the bank also recorded deferred income of million related to the transfer that is expected to be recognized into income in future periods after the ultimate investments are made

in december  the investors made qualifying investments of million of the million noted above

in addition  ccdc has retained a interest in three other entities created to facilitate the investments with the investor owning the remaining 
ccdc also provides certain administrative services to these special purpose entities 
the bank has determined that its and ccdc involvement with these special purpose entities does not expose it to the majority of expected loss or residual returns and therefore it is not the primary beneficiary of these entities

in february  the company announced that carver federal had been selected to receive a third nmtc award in the amount of million 
critical accounting policies various elements of accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
carver policy with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance for loan and lease losses and assessment of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset are the most critical accounting policies 
these policies is important to the presentation of carver financial condition and results of operations  and it involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments  which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
the use of different judgments  assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in the company results of operations or financial condition 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company summary of significant accounting policies  including those related to allowance for loan losses  and an explanation of the methods and assumptions underlying their application 
allowance for loan and lease losses the adequacy of the bank alll is determined by the bank  in consideration of the interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses the interagency policy statement released by the office of thrift supervision on december  and in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic formerly known as statement of financial account standards sfas no

the alll reflects management evaluation of the loans presenting identified loss potential  as well as the risk inherent in various components of the portfolio 
there is a great amount of judgment applied to developing the alll 
as such  there can never be assurance that the alll provision accurately reflects the actual loss potential embedded in a loan portfolio 
further  an increase in the size of the portfolio or any of its components  or any of the factors utilized to establish the alll  could necessitate an increase in the alll even though there may not be a decline in credit quality or an increase in potential problem loans 
compliance with the interagency policy statement includes management review of the bank loan portfolio  including the identification and review of individual problem situations that may affect a borrower ability to repay 
in addition  management reviews the overall portfolio quality through an analysis of delinquency and non performing loan data  estimates of the value of underlying collateral  current charge offs and other factors that may affect the portfolio  including a review of regulatory examinations  an assessment of current and expected economic conditions and changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio are all taken into consideration 
general reserve allowance the bank maintains a general reserve allowance in accordance with asc topic formerly known as sfas no 
whereby the bank evaluates the risk of loss potential of homogeneous pools of loans 
the homogeneous pools consist of loans classified by risk rating pass and pass with care  special mention  substandard and doubtful and loans classified by major loan type residential  construction  multifamily  commercial real estate  business  sba and consumer 
the bank next applies a factor reserve factor to each separate homogeneous pool to determine the amount of general reserves required for that pool 
the reserve requirements for each individual pool are combined to determine the total general reserve allowance 
the reserve factor utilized for each separate homogeneous pool is based upon a review of different quantitative and qualitative factors 
the first and most significant factor utilized is actual historical loss experience by major loan category expressed as a percentage of the average outstanding of all loans within the category over the most recent four quarters 
as the loss experience for a particular loan category increases or decreases  the level of reserves required for that particular loan category also increases or decreases 
the bank concurs with the interagency policy statement suggestion that  while historical loss experience provides a reasonable starting point for the development of inherent credit losses  historical losses  or even recent trends in losses do not by themselves form a sufficient basis to determine the appropriate level for the alll 
therefore  the bank also considers the following nine qualitative factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with the existing portfolio to differ from historical loss experience as a general rule  the qualitative factors generally increase as loan risk ratings decrease 
the bank has maintained the same level of increase that the bank utilized for the three month period ended december  during this period the bank utilized seven of the nine factors policy and procedures  economy  management  loan review  collateral value  concentrations 
policy and procedures 
changes in lending policies and procedures  including changes in underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses 
economy 
changes in relevant economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio  including the condition of various market segments 
nature and volume 
changes in the nature or volume of the loan portfolio and in the terms of loans 
management 
changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff 
problem assets 
changes in the volume and severity of past due loans  the volume of nonaccrual loans  and the volume and severity of adversely classified loans 
loan review 
changes in the quality of the loan review system 
collateral values 
changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans 
concentrations 
the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations 
external forces 
the effect of other external forces such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing portfolio 
as a general rule  the qualitative factors generally increase as loan risk ratings decrease 
all non performing loans and certain delinquent loans  as identified through the alll review process  are evaluated individually for potential losses in accordance with interagency and gaap guidance and consistent with the bank alll policy and methodology 
the individuals evaluating the loans include the chief risk officer  chief lending officer  credit officer  workout officer  loan officers and consultants 
the conclusions reached as a result of the evaluation process are submitted to management and asset liability and interest rate risk committee of the board of directors for their review and approval 
the bank also maintains a specific reserve allowance for criticized and classified loans that are reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc topic guidelines and deemed to be impaired 
specific reserve allowance asc topic is the primary basis for valuing the impairments of specific loans whose collectability has been called into question 
the amount assigned to this aspect of the alll is the individually determined loan by loan portion 
the standard requires the use of one of the following three approved methods to estimate the amount to be reserved for such credits 
i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan effective interest rate  ii the loan observable market price  or iii the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
for loans individually evaluated for impairment under asc topic  the institution may choose the appropriate measurement basis  except for an impaired collateral dependent loan 
regulatory guidance requires impairment of a collateral dependent loan to be measured using the fair value of collateral method 
classified loans loans rated substandard and doubtful with at risk balances of  or more  new troubled debt restructurings and other loans determined by the credit officer are reviewed for individual evaluation for impairment in accordance with asc topic if it is determined that it is probable the bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  the loan is impaired 
if the loan is determined to be not impaired  it is placed with its respective group of homogeneous loans to be included in the general reserve allowance 
if the loan is determined to be impaired  it is evaluated to determine the measure of impairment amount based on one of the three measurement methods noted above 
if it is determined that there is an impairment amount  the bank then determines whether the impairment amount is permanent that is a confirmed loss  in which case the impairment is charged off  or if it is other than permanent  in which case the bank establishes a specific valuation reserve that is included in the total alll 
in accordance with gaap guidance  if the loan is impaired and there is no impairment amount  no reserve is established for the loan 
the bank has historically been primarily a commercial real estate cre and multi family mortgage lender  with a significant portion of its loan portfolio secured by buildings in the new york city metropolitan area 
payments on multi family and cre loans generally depend on the income produced by the underlying properties which  in turn  depends on their successful operation and management 
accordingly  the ability of the bank borrowers to repay these loans may be impacted by adverse conditions in the local real estate market and the local economy 
while the bank generally requires that such loans be qualified on the basis of the collateral property current cash flows  appraised value  and debt service coverage ratio  among other factors  there can be no assurance that the bank underwriting policies will protect the bank from credit related losses or delinquencies 
the bank seeks to minimize the risks involved in commercial small business lending by underwriting such loans on the basis of the cash flows produced by the business  by requiring that such loans be collateralized by various business assets  including inventory  equipment  and accounts receivable  among others  and by requiring personal guarantees 
however  the capacity of a borrower to repay a commercial small business loan is substantially dependent on the degree to which his or her business is successful 
in addition  the collateral underlying such loans may depreciate over time  may not be conducive to appraisal  or may fluctuate in value  based upon the business results 
during the fiscal year  the bank marketplace continued to be impacted by the widespread economic decline 
the ability of the bank borrowers to repay their loans  and the value of the collateral securing such loans  has been significantly impacted and could be further adversely impacted by additional adverse changes in local economic conditions  such as a decline in real estate values or a rise in unemployment 
this  in turn  could not only result in the bank experiencing an increase in charge offs and or non performing assets  but could also necessitate an increase in the provision for loan losses 
these events would have an adverse impact on the bank results of operations and capital  if they were they to occur 
trouble debt restructured tdr loans consist of loans where borrowers have been granted concessions in regard to the terms of their loans due to financial or other difficulties  which rendered them unable to repay their loans under the original contractual terms 
tdr will be placed on non accrual status if they have not been performing in accordance with the restructured terms for a period of at least months 
deferred tax asset the future recognition of carver deferred tax asset is highly dependent upon carver ability to generate sufficient taxable income 
a valuation allowance is required to be maintained for any deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely than not to be unrealizable  based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made 
in assessing carver need for a valuation allowance  we rely upon estimates of future taxable income 
although we use the best available information to estimate future taxable income  underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances influencing our projections 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws  statutory tax rates  and future taxable income levels 
in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease in income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made 
no assurances can be made that the company will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to realize the deferred tax asset 
on june   the company raised million of equity 
the capital raise may trigger a change in control under section of the internal revenue code 
generally  section limits the utilization of an entity net operating loss carry forwards and general business credits upon a change in control 
if the change in control is triggered  it could result in a loss of deductibility of a portion of the company deferred tax asset 
asset liability management the company primary earnings source is net interest income  which is affected by changes in the level of interest rates  the relationship between the rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the impact of interest rate fluctuations on asset prepayments  the level and composition of deposits and the credit quality of earning assets 
management asset liability objectives are to maintain a strong  stable net interest margin  to utilize its capital effectively without taking undue risks  to maintain adequate liquidity and to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
the economic environment is uncertain regarding future interest rate trends 
management monitors the company cumulative gap position  which is the difference between the sensitivity to rate changes on the company interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  the company uses various tools to monitor and manage interest rate risk  such as a model that projects net interest income based on increasing or decreasing interest rates 
stock repurchase program refer to item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 
discussion of market risk interest rate sensitivity analysis as a financial institution  the bank primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the bank assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which are short term in maturity 
since virtually all of the company interest bearing assets and liabilities are held by the bank  most of the company interest rate risk exposure is retained by the bank 
as a result  all significant interest rate risk management procedures are performed at the bank 
based upon the bank nature of operations  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the bank does not own any trading assets 
carver federal seeks to manage its interest rate risk by monitoring and controlling the variation in repricing intervals between its assets and liabilities 
to a lesser extent  carver federal also monitors its interest rate sensitivity by analyzing the estimated changes in market value of its assets and liabilities assuming various interest rate scenarios 
as discussed more fully below  there are a variety of factors that influence the repricing characteristics of any given asset or liability 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific period if it will mature or reprice within that period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific period of time and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
generally  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap could result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap could adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of rising interest rates a negative gap could adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap could result in an increase in net interest income 
as illustrated below  carver federal had a negative one year gap equal to of total rate sensitive assets at march  as a result  carver federal net interest income may be negatively affected by rising interest rates and may be positively affected by falling interest rates 
the following table sets forth information regarding the projected maturities  prepayments and repricing of the major rate sensitive asset and liability categories of carver federal as of march  maturity repricing dates have been projected by applying estimated prepayment rates based on the current rate environment 
the information presented in the following table is derived in part from data incorporated in schedule cmr consolidated maturity and rate  which is part of the bank quarterly reports filed with the ots 
the repricing and other assumptions are not necessarily representative of the bank actual results 
classifications of items in the table below are different from those presented in other tables and the financial statements and accompanying notes included herein and do not reflect non performing loans dollars in thousands mos

certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the table above 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in the market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  generally have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
additionally  credit risk may increase as many borrowers may experience an inability to service their debt in the event of a rise in interest rate 
virtually all of the adjustable rate loans in carver federal portfolio contain conditions that restrict the periodic change in interest rate 
net portfolio value npv analysis 
as part of its efforts to maximize net interest income while managing risks associated with changing interest rates  management also uses the npv methodology 
npv is the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets less the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of net expected cash inflows from existing financial derivatives and off balance sheet contracts 
under this methodology  interest rate risk exposure is assessed by reviewing the estimated changes in npv that would hypothetically occur if interest rates rapidly rise or fall along the yield curve 
projected values of npv at both higher and lower regulatory defined rate scenarios are compared to base case values no change in rates to determine the sensitivity to changing interest rates 
presented below  as of march   is an analysis of the bank interest rate risk as measured by changes in npv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts of basis points and basis points plus or minus changes in market interest rates and a sustained parallel shift of plus basis points and basis points change in market interest rates 
such limits have been established with consideration of the impact of various rate changes and the bank current capital position 
the bank considers its level of interest rate risk for fiscal  as measured by changes in npv  to be minimal 
the information set forth below relates solely to the bank  however  because virtually all of the company interest rate risk exposure lies at the bank level  management believes the table below also similarly reflects an analysis of the company interest rate risk dollars in thousands net portfolio value npv as of pv of assets change in rate amount change change npv ratio change bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp march  risk measures bp rate shock pre shock npv ratio npv as of pv of assets post shock npv ratio sensitivity measure decline in npv ratio bp certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv require the making of certain assumptions  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv table presented assumes that the composition of carver federal interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv table provides an indication of carver federal interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on carver federal net interest income and may differ from actual results 
average balance  interest and average yields and rates the following table sets forth certain information relating to carver federal average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities and related yields for the years ended march    and the table also presents information for the fiscal years indicated with respect to the difference between the weighted average yield earned on interest earning assets and the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  or interest rate spread  which savings institutions have traditionally used as an indicator of profitability 
another indicator of an institution profitability is its net interest margin  which is its net interest income divided by the average balance of interest earning assets 
net interest income is affected by the interest rate spread and by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income dollars in thousands interest earning assets average balance interest average yield cost average balance interest average yield cost average balance interest average yield cost loans mortgage backed securities investment securities fed funds sold other total interest earning assets non interest earning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities deposits now demand savings money market savings certificates of deposit mortgagors deposits total deposits borrowed money total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing liabilities demand other liabilities total liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity net interest income average interest rate spread net interest margin ratio of average interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities the average balance of loans includes nonaccrual loans  loans held for sale  and deferred fees and expenses 
rate volume analysis the following table sets forth information regarding the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest related assets and liabilities have affected carver federal interest income and expense during the fiscal years ended march    and in thousands for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided for changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  changes in rate change in rate multiplied by old volume

these increases were partially offset by total loans receivable which decreased million  loan loss provision increasing million  surrender of the bank owned life insurance boli of million and the deferred tax asset decreased million 
cash and cash equivalents increased million  or  to million at march   compared to million at march  this increase was driven by a million increase in money market investments  partially offset by a million decrease in cash and due from banks 
the increase is due to the company maintaining higher levels of cash liquidity 
total securities increased million  or  to million at march   compared to million at march   reflecting an increase of million in available for sale securities and a million increase in held to maturity securities 
the variance is due to the purchase of agency and us treasury securities with the excess cash inflows from loan activities 
total loans decreased million  or  to million at march   compared to million at march  principal repayments across all loan classifications contributed to the decrease  with the largest impact from commercial real estate million  construction million and business million loans  coupled with an increase in the allowance for loan loss of million 
office properties and equipment decreased million  or  to million at march   compared to million at march   primarily due to the depreciation of equipment 
the deferred tax asset decreased by  to at march   compared to million at march  primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded 
where applicable  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance for any portion determined not likely to be realized 
this valuation allowance would subsequently be adjusted  by a charge or credit to income tax expense  as changes in facts and circumstances warrant 
a valuation allowance of million was recorded during the twelve month period as management concluded that it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to fully realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets 
the change in valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended ended march  amounted to million due to a reduction in the recognized deferred tax asset for the corresponding period 
other assets increased million  or  to million at march   compared to million at march   primarily due to increases in real estate owned assets and assorted account receivables 
liabilities and stockholders equity liabilities total liabilities decreased million  or  to million at march   compared to million at march  the decrease in total liabilities is primarily due to the decline in total deposits of million and the maturity of two fixed rate notes from the fhlb ny totaling million 
deposits decreased million  or  to million at march   compared to million at march  deposits decreased as we replaced xx million of institutional deposits which were partially offset by an increase in core deposits 
cdar deposits decreased million as the orders issued to carver federal restricted the banks ability to add new cdars deposit accounts and renew existing deposits 
advances from the fhlb ny and other borrowed money decreased million  or  to million at march   compared to million at march  the decrease was the result of the maturities of fixed rate notes in may million and july million 
stockholders equity total stockholders equity decreased million  or  to million at march   compared to million at march  the decrease in stockholders equity is primarily due to the valuation allowance recorded on the deferred tax asset and the loan loss provisions recorded during the period 
comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and net loss net loss for fiscal  was million compared to a net loss of million for the prior year 
the losses for both periods are due primarily to a higher provision for loan losses and an million valuation allowance recorded against the company deferred tax asset 
net interest income interest income decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in interest income on loans and moderate decrease in interest income on securities 
the decrease in interest income reflects a reduction in the yield on interest earning assets of basis points to for fiscal compared to a yield of for the prior year period 
this decrease in yield on interest earning assets was primarily the result of a basis point reduction in the yield on loans 
the increase in interest income on mortgage backed securities was primarily the result of an increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities from million in the prior year period to million in the current period 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease in interest expense resulted primarily from an basis point decrease in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities to for fiscal compared to an average cost of for the prior year as higher cost certificates of deposits re priced at lower rates as well as lower cost core deposits and transactional accounts 
provision for loan losses the bank recorded a million provision for loan losses in fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
the increased provision is in response to the company current levels of delinquencies and non performing loans and the uncertainty caused by the uneven economic recovery in the real estate market and the new york city economy 
at march   non performing assets totaled million  or of total assets compared to million or of total assets at march  the allowance for loan losses was million at march   which represents a ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans of compared to at march  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was at march  up from at march  non interest income non interest income increased million to million in fiscal compared to million for the prior year period 
the increase is primarily due to fees of million received on four nmtc transactions as well as a reduction of million in the amount required to reflect loans held for sale at the lower of cost or fair value  offset by a non recurring gain on the sale of a bank owned building of million in the prior year period non interest expense non interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
income tax benefit the bank recorded a tax expense of million in fiscal compared to a tax benefit of million for the prior year period 
the income tax expense recorded for the fiscal year ended march  consisted of an income tax benefit of million primarily due to the company loss before income taxes during the year compared to the prior year 
this benefit is offset by an income tax expense that is associated with a million valuation allowance against the company deferred tax asset recorded during the period 
management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to fully realize the benefit of its deferred tax asset and thus  a valuation allowance of million was recorded during the period comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and net loss net loss for fiscal  was million compared to a net loss of million for the prior year 
the improvement for fiscal was the result of an increase in net interest income  an increase in non interest income  and a decrease in non interest expense primarily due to the non cash goodwill impairment charge booked in fiscal these improvements were partially offset by an increase in provision for loan losses and a decrease in income tax benefit 
net interest income interest income decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in interest income on loans partially offset by an increase in interest income on securities 
the decrease in interest income reflects a reduction in the yield on interest earning assets of basis points to for fiscal compared to a yield of for the prior year period 
this decrease in yield on interest earning assets was primarily the result of a basis point reduction in the yield on loans of which basis points was due to a higher level of non performing loans and the remainder primarily due to new loan originations coming on at lower interest rates due to lower market interest rates 
the increase in interest income on mortgage backed securities was primarily the result of an increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities from million in the prior year period to million in the current period 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease in interest expense resulted primarily from an basis point decrease in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities to for fiscal compared to an average cost of for the prior year as higher cost institutional deposits were replaced by lower cost core deposits and transactional accounts 
this improvement was partially offset by growth in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of million  or  to million at march   compared to million for the prior year 
provision for loan losses the bank recorded a million provision for loan losses in fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
the increased provision is in response to the company current levels of delinquencies and non performing loans and the uncertainty caused by the uneven economic recovery in the real estate market and the new york city economy 
at march   non performing assets totaled million  or of total assets compared to million or of total assets at march  total delinquencies declined year over year by to million or of total assets 
the allowance for loan losses was million at march   which represents a ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans of compared to at march  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was at march  up from at march  non interest income non interest income decreased million to million in fiscal compared to million for the prior year period 
the decrease is primarily due to the write down in the carrying value of loans previously held for sale of million  mostly offset by million of fees recognized during fiscal related to several nmtc transactions  a gain on the sale of securities of million and a million gain on the sale of a bank owned building 
the sale of this building was an essential part of the bank strategy to optimize branch locations 
non interest expense non interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
this improvement is primarily due to the million non cash goodwill impairment charge incurred in the prior year 
additionally  there were decreases of million in employee compensation and benefits on lower staffing levels and discretionary compensation  million in occupancy and equipment expense resulting from the branch optimization strategy  and million in consulting fees 
these decreases in expense were partially offset by increases of million in fdic insurance premiums and million related to the write down of an advance to a vendor see paragraph below 
on february   the president of a money services firm which the bank used to service its remote atm locations was arrested on charges of defrauding another financial institution 
the bank has a claim pending for  for funds which we had advanced to the money services firm 
the money service firm is now under the oversight of a bankruptcy trustee 
carver has fully reserved the  but we continue to pursue all avenues available to us for the return of our funds 
there was no adverse impact on the operations of our remote atms as a result of this event 
income taxes the bank recorded a tax benefit of million in fiscal compared to a tax benefit of million for the prior year period 
the lower tax benefit in fiscal is a result of the smaller loss generated versus the prior period 
the total tax benefit for fiscal reflects tax credits of million generated by our nmtc investment transactions versus tax credits on nmtc investment transactions of million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of the bank ability to generate adequate cash to meet its financial obligations 
the principal cash requirements of a financial institution are to cover potential deposit outflows  fund increases in its loan and investment portfolios and ongoing operating expenses 
the bank primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowed funds and principal and interest payments on loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan and mortgage backed securities prepayments are strongly influenced by changes in general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
carver federal monitors its liquidity utilizing guidelines that are contained in a policy developed by its management and approved by its board of directors 
carver federal several liquidity measurements are evaluated on a frequent basis 
the bank was in compliance with this policy as of march  management believes carver federal short term assets have sufficient liquidity to cover loan demand  potential fluctuations in deposit accounts and to meet other anticipated cash requirements 
additionally  carver federal has other sources of liquidity including the ability to borrow from the fhlb ny utilizing unpledged mortgage backed securities and certain mortgage loans  the sale of available for sale securities and the sale of certain mortgage loans 
net borrowings decreased million during fiscal primarily as a result of the bank utilizing excess liquidity to paydown its maturing borrowings 
at march   the bank had million in borrowings with a weighted average rate of maturing over the next three years 
the continued disruption in the credit markets has not materially impacted the company ability to access borrowings 
at march   based on available collateral held at the fhlb ny  carver federal had the ability to borrow from the fhlb ny an additional million on a secured basis  utilizing mortgage related loans and securities as collateral 
the bank most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the level of these assets is dependent on the bank operating  investing and financing activities during any given period 
at march  and  assets qualifying for short term liquidity  including cash and short term investments  totaled million and million  respectively 
the most significant liquidity challenge the bank faces is variability in its cash flows as a result of mortgage refinance activity 
when mortgage interest rates decline  customers refinance activities tend to accelerate  causing the cash flow from both the mortgage loan portfolio and the mortgage backed securities portfolio to accelerate 
in contrast  when mortgage interest rates increase  refinance activities tend to slow  causing a reduction of liquidity 
however  in a rising rate environment  customers generally tend to prefer fixed rate mortgage loan products over variable rate products 
because carver federal generally sells its one to four family year and year fixed rate loan production into the secondary mortgage market  the origination of such products for sale does not significantly reduce carver federal liquidity 
the ots requires that the bank meet minimum capital requirements 
capital adequacy is one of the most important factors used to determine the safety and soundness of individual banks and the banking system 
at march   the bank regulatory capital ratios were below the minimum level established by the ots in its cease and desist order of february see regulatory capital position below for certain information relating to the bank regulatory capital compliance at march  the consolidated statements of cash flows present the change in cash from operating  investing and financing activities 
during fiscal  total cash and cash equivalents increased by million reflecting cash provided by operating activities of million  cash provided by investing activities of million offset by cash used by financing activities of million 
net cash provided by operating activities during this period was million and was primarily the result of an increase in provision for loan losses of million  deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance of million offset by a net loss of million 
net cash provided by investing activities was million primarily the result of a net inflow of loan activity by million  offset by securities purchases  principal pay downs  maturities  and calls million 
net cash used by financing activities was million  primarily resulting from decreased deposits of million and fhlb and other borrowings of million  offset partially by capital contribution of million 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the bank is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  these instruments are not recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
such instruments primarily include lending commitments 
lending commitments include commitments to originate mortgage and consumer loans and commitments to fund unused lines of credit 
the bank also has contractual obligations related to operating leases
