table of contents financial highlights the following financial highlights are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap viad corp consolidated total revenues of million  an increase of percent from revenues net income attributable to viad of  compared to a loss of million in diluted income per share of compared to a loss per share of in viad recorded restructuring charges totaling million primarily related to reorganization activities in the marketing events group  comprised of the elimination of certain positions as well as facility consolidations income from discontinued operations of  related to the reversal of certain liabilities associated with previously sold operations cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  debt was million as of december  marketing events us revenues of million  as compared to million in segment operating loss of million  as compared to million in marketing events international revenues of million  an increase of percent from revenues segment operating income of million compared to million in travel recreation group revenues of million  an increase of percent from revenues segment operating income of million  as compared to million in non gaap measures the following discussion includes a presentation of adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses  which are utilized by management to measure the profit and performance of viad s operations and to facilitate period to period comparisons 
adjusted ebitda is defined by viad as net income attributable to viad before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  impairment losses and recoveries  changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations 
income before impairment losses is defined by viad as income from continuing operations before the after tax effect of impairment losses related to goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets 
the presentation of adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses is supplemental to results presented under gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
adjusted ebitda is considered a useful operating metric as potential variations arising from taxes  depreciation  debt service costs  impairment losses and recoveries  changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations are eliminated  thus resulting in an additional measure considered to be indicative of viad s ongoing operations 
income before impairment losses is utilized by management to review operating results of the business without the effects of non cash impairment losses 
these non gaap measures should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses provides useful information to investors regarding viad s results of operations for trending  analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of viad s business 
management uses adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses primarily as performance measures and believes that the gaap financial measures most directly comparable to these non gaap measures are net income attributable to viad and income from continuing operations attributable to viad  respectively 
although adjusted ebitda is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business  the use of adjusted ebitda is limited because it does not consider material costs  expenses and other items necessary to operate the business 
these items include debt service costs  
table of contents non cash depreciation and amortization expense associated with long lived assets  expenses related to us federal  state  local and foreign income taxes  impairment losses or recoveries  and the effects of accounting changes and discontinued operations 
similarly  although income before impairment losses is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business  its use is limited because it does not consider non cash goodwill  other intangible asset and other long lived asset impairment losses 
because adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses do not consider the above items  a user of viad s financial information should consider net income attributable to viad and income from continuing operations attributable to viad as important measures of financial performance because they provide more complete measures of the company s performance 
a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss attributable to viad is as follows in thousands adjusted ebitda impairment losses interest expense income tax benefit expense depreciation and amortization income from discontinued operations net income loss attributable to viad the increase in adjusted ebitda of million from to was primarily driven by higher segment operating results at all operating segments and lower restructuring charges 
the decrease in adjusted ebitda of million from to was primarily driven by lower segment operating results at all operating segments  restructuring charges and lower interest income  partially offset by lower corporate activities expense 
a reconciliation of income loss before impairment losses attributable to viad to income loss from continuing operations attributable to viad is as follows in thousands income loss before impairment losses attributable to viad impairment losses  net of tax income loss from continuing operations attributable to viad includes income tax benefits of  million and million in  and  respectively

net restructuring charges in were million compared to million in  both primarily related to the marketing events group 
the improved results as compared to were also the result of higher revenues  overhead reductions and productivity improvements driven by the company s lean initiatives 
net income attributable to viad for was  or per diluted share  compared to a loss of million  or per diluted share  in these results include income from discontinued operations of  or per diluted share  in and  or per diluted share  in relating to obligations associated with previously sold operations

future decreases in the exchange rates may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period to period comparisons when operating results are translated into us dollars 
marketing events group 
revenues for the marketing events us segment were million for  up percent compared to million in the increase was primarily due to positive show rotation of million in revenue  mostly offset by reductions in brand marketer spending and a base same show revenue decline of one percent 
management defines base same show revenue as revenue from exhibitions and events that occur in the same quarter and same city every year 
base same shows represented percent of marketing events us segment revenues in the segment operating loss was million  compared to a loss of million in the improved operating results were primarily the result of higher revenues  overhead reductions of approximately million versus and productivity improvements driven by the company s lean initiatives  partially offset by higher accruals for performance based incentives which were not significant in and pricing pressures

the increase in revenue primarily resulted from market share gains  improving industry trends  a major project for the winter olympic games in canada and positive show rotation of million 
the improved operating income was primarily the result of higher revenues  partially offset by performance based incentives and the reinstatement of full wages after a temporary reduction in although the marketing events group has a diversified revenue base and long term contracts for future shows  its revenues are affected by general economic and industry specific conditions 
the prospects for individual shows tend to be driven by the success of the industry related to those shows 
in general  the exhibition and event industry is experiencing modest improvement 
following quarterly declines from the second quarter of through the first quarter of  marketing events us base same show revenues were essentially flat in the second quarter and increased by percent and percent in the third and fourth quarters  respectively 
excluding the strong growth of a major auto show  the fourth quarter increase in us base same show revenues was percent 
in  management expects us same show revenues to increase at a mid single digit rate 
additionally  management expects show rotation to positively impact full year revenues by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange rate variances are not expected to have a significant impact on full year results 
management remains focused on improving the profitability of the us segment through continued integration and consolidation of operations to increase capacity utilization and reduce costs 
management expects to record restructuring charges of approximately  in the first quarter of as a result of these efforts 
additional charges may be incurred as additional cost structure improvements are made 
the marketing events group is subject to multiple collective bargaining agreements that affect labor costs  about one fourth of which expire each year 
although labor relations between the company and labor are currently stable  disruptions during future contract negotiations could occur  with the possibility of an adverse impact on the operating results of the marketing events group

table of contents income of million 
as discussed above  results in this segment were impacted by exchange rate variances during  resulting in increases of million and  in revenues and segment operating income  respectively  as compared to excluding exchange rate variances  revenues increased by million  or percent  primarily due to initiatives to capture incremental spend per guest as well as stronger demand for the company s tourism services that was partly related to the centennial anniversary of glacier national park and the winter olympic and paralympic games 
the travel recreation group segment is affected by consumer discretionary spending on tourism activities 
management expects results from the travel recreation group segment to benefit from improved tourism demand versus management anticipates that foreign currency exchange rate variances versus will not have a significant impact on results 
additionally  management anticipates lower room revenues at many glacier hotel  a property operated by glacier park  inc  due to planned construction that will reduce the number of rooms available during as compared to however  management expects the acquisition of grouse mountain lodge  which is located near glacier national park  to more than offset the revenue decline at many glacier hotel 
the company acquired the room grouse mountain lodge on january  for million in cash 
during  approximately percent of revenue and percent of segment operating income generated in the travel recreation group segment was derived through its canadian operations 
these operations are largely affected by foreign customer visitation  and  accordingly  increases in the value of the canadian dollar compared to other currencies could adversely affect customer volumes  revenue and segment operating income from the travel recreation group segment 
glacier park operates the concession portion of its business under a concession contract with the us national park service the park service for glacier national park 
glacier park s original year concession contract with the park service that was to expire on december   has been extended for six one year periods and now expires on december  the park service  in its sole discretion  may continue extending glacier park s concession contract in one year increments 
when this contract ultimately expires  glacier park will have the opportunity to bid on a new concession contract 
if glacier park does secure a new contract  possible terms would be for  or years 
glacier park generated approximately percent of its revenue through its concession contract for services provided within glacier national park 
if a new concessionaire is selected by the park service  glacier park s remaining business would consist of its operations at waterton lakes national park  alberta  canada  east glacier  montana and whitefish  montana 
in such a circumstance  glacier park would be entitled to an amount equal to its possessory interest  which generally means the value of the structures acquired or constructed  fixtures installed and improvements made to the concession property at glacier national park during the term of the concession contract 
glacier park owns its glacier park lodge operations in east glacier  montana as well as the grouse mountain lodge in whitefish  montana acquired january

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding those obligations 
purchase obligations primarily represent payments due under various licensing agreements and commitments related to product licenses  consulting and other contracted services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including open purchase orders 
aggregate liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions of million including interest and penalties are excluded from the table above as the timing and amounts of future cash outflows are highly uncertain 
viad and certain of its subsidiaries are plaintiffs or defendants to various actions  proceedings and pending claims  some of which involve  or may involve  compensatory  punitive or other damages 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal actions  proceedings or claims could be decided against viad 
although the amount of liability as of december  with respect to these matters is not ascertainable  viad believes that any resulting liability  after taking into consideration amounts already provided for  including insurance coverage  will not have a material effect on viad s business  financial position or results of operations

viad s businesses contribute to various multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering its union represented employees 
viad s contributions to these plans in  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
based upon the information available to viad from plan administrators  management believes that several of these multi employer plans are underfunded 
the pension protection act of requires pension plans underfunded at certain levels to reduce  over defined time periods  the underfunded status 
in addition  under current laws  the termination of a plan  or a voluntary withdrawal from a plan by viad  or a shrinking contribution base to a plan as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other contributing employers to such plan would require viad to make payments to such plan for its proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities 
as of december   the amount of additional funding  if any  that viad would be required to make related to multi employer pension plans is not ascertainable 
off balance sheet arrangements viad does not have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated special purpose or other entities that would materially affect the company s financial position  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources

table of contents credit risk support  or engage in leasing or other services that may expose the company to liability or risks of loss that are not reflected in viad s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and that require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on these criteria  viad has identified and discussed with its audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates pertaining to viad  and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates goodwill goodwill is not amortized  but tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on october of each year 
goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
viad s reporting units are defined  and goodwill is tested  at either an operating segment level or at the component level of an operating segment  depending on various factors including the internal reporting structure of the operating segment  the level of integration among components  the sharing of assets among components and the benefits and likely recoverability of goodwill by the component s operations 
as of december   viad had total goodwill of million consisting of million related to the marketing events group and million related to the travel recreation group 
within the marketing events group  goodwill of million relates to the marketing events us segment and million to the marketing events international segment 
for impairment testing purposes  the goodwill related to the marketing events us segment is assigned to and tested at the operating segment level  which represents all domestic operations of ges 
furthermore  the goodwill related to the marketing events international segment is assigned to and tested at the component level within the segment s geographical operations 
as of december   the amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting units in the united kingdom melville and canada was million and million  respectively 
also  as of december   the brewster operating segment within the travel recreation group had goodwill of million 
brewster is considered a reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
viad uses a discounted expected future cash flow methodology income approach in order to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows  discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions  financial forecasts  industry trends and historical experience 
the most critical assumptions and estimates in determining the estimated fair value of its reporting units relate to the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows for each reporting unit and the reporting unit cost of capital discount rate applied to those cash flows 
furthermore  the assumed reporting unit cost of capital rates discount rates are estimated using a build up method based on the perceived risk associated with the cash flows pertaining to the specific reporting unit 
in order to assess the reasonableness of its fair value estimates  the company performs a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values of its reporting units to viad s market capitalization 
as noted above  the estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows  discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions  financial forecasts  industry trends and historical experience 
these estimates  however  have inherent uncertainties and different assumptions could lead to materially different results 
as of december   viad had aggregate goodwill of million recorded in the consolidated balance sheets 
furthermore  as a result of the company s most recent impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of  the excess of the estimated fair values over the carrying values expressed as a percentage of the carrying amounts under step one of the impairment test were percent  percent and percent  respectively  for each of the marketing events group reporting units in the united states  the united kingdom melville and canada 
for the brewster reporting unit  the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value was percent as of the most recent impairment test 
due to continued uncertainties in the current economic environment  reductions in the company s expected future revenue  operating income or cash flow forecasts and projections  or an increase in reporting unit cost of capital  could trigger additional goodwill impairment testing  which may result in impairment losses 
furthermore  management continues to monitor the market capitalization of the company as ongoing declines in market capitalization could be indicative of possible goodwill impairment 
see results of operations above and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of goodwill impairment losses recorded during and 
table of contents income taxes viad is required to estimate and record provisions for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
accordingly  the company must estimate its actual current income tax liability  and assess temporary differences arising from the treatment of items for tax purposes as compared to the treatment for accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in viad s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
the company uses significant judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and evaluates the available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
as of december  and  viad had gross deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
these deferred tax assets reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized upon reversal of deductible temporary differences  and the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
during and  viad recorded pre tax losses from its operations in the united states 
the company considered the negative evidence of these domestic pre tax operating losses on the future recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
viad also considered positive evidence regarding the realization of deferred tax assets including the company s historical and forecasted taxable income  taxpaying history and future reversals of deferred tax liabilities 
furthermore  viad also considered the fact that goodwill impairment losses are not tax deductible and thus did not contribute to tax losses in as of december  and  viad had a valuation allowance of  and  respectively  related to certain state deferred tax assets 
with respect to all other deferred tax assets  management believes that recovery from future taxable income is more likely than not 
as noted above  viad uses considerable judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
as a result  there are inherent uncertainties regarding the ultimate realization of these assets  which is primarily dependent on viad s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods 
in light of the company s recent domestic operating losses  and the continued uncertainties in the current economic environment  it is possible that the relative weight of positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of viad s deferred tax assets may change  which could result in a material increase in the company s valuation allowance 
if such an increase in the valuation allowance were to occur  it would result in increased income tax expense in the period the assessment was made 
viad exercises judgment in determining its income tax provision due to transactions  credits and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as of december  and  viad did not have any accrued gross liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions for continuing operations 
however  as of december  and  viad had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions for continuing operations of  and  respectively 
during  and  viad recorded tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of tax matters in continuing operations of  million and million  respectively 
these tax resolutions primarily represent the reversal of amounts accrued for tax and related interest and penalties in connection with uncertain tax positions which were effectively settled or for which there was a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations 
in addition to the above  viad had accrued gross liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions for discontinued operations of  as of both december  and in addition  as of december  and  viad had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions for discontinued operations of  and  respectively 
future tax resolutions or settlements that may occur related to these uncertain tax positions would be recorded through discontinued operations net of federal tax effects  if applicable 
insurance liabilities viad is self insured up to certain limits for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability and property loss claims 
the aggregate amount of insurance liabilities related to viad s continuing operations was million as of december  of this total  million related to workers compensation liabilities and the remaining million related to general auto liability claims 
viad has also retained and provided for certain insurance liabilities in conjunction with previously sold businesses totaling million as of december   primarily related to workers compensation liabilities 
provisions for losses for claims incurred  including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported  are made based on viad s historical experience  claims frequency and other factors 
a change in the assumptions used could result in an adjustment to recorded liabilities 
viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self insured levels  which generally range from  to  on a per claim basis 
viad does not maintain a self insured retention pool fund as claims are paid from current cash resources at the time of settlement 
viad s net cash payments in connection with these insurance liabilities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
pension and postretirement benefits viad s pension plans use traditional defined benefit formulas based on years of service and final average compensation 
funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations 
the company presently anticipates contributing million to its funded pension plans and  to its unfunded pension plans in 
table of contents viad and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees  retirees and dependents 
the related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period that services are provided by employees 
in addition  viad retained the obligations for these benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses 
while the plans have no funding requirements  viad expects to contribute  to the plans in the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the december  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was nine and one half percent  declining one half percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the december  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was ten percent  declining one half percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately  a one percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately  the weighted average assumptions used to determine the postretirement benefit obligations as of december were as follows domestic plans postretirement funded plans unfunded plans benefit plans foreign plans discount rate the weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost were as follows domestic plans postretirement funded plans unfunded plans benefit plans foreign plans discount rate expected return on plan assets n a n a the discount rates used in determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations are based on rates determined by actuarial analysis and management review  and reflect the estimated rates of return on a high quality  hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flows match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments

share based compensation viad grants share based compensation awards to officers  directors and certain key employees pursuant to the viad corp omnibus incentive plan the plan 
the plan has a ten year life and provides for the following types of awards a incentive and non qualified stock options  b restricted stock and restricted stock units  c performance units or performance shares  d stock appreciation rights  e cash based awards and f certain other stock based awards 
share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
furthermore  the total tax benefits related to such costs were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
no share based compensation costs were capitalized during  or the fair value of restricted stock and performance based restricted stock awards are based on viad s stock price on the date of grant 
liability based awards are recorded at estimated fair value  based on the number of units expected to vest and the level of achievement of predefined performance goals where applicable and are remeasured on each balance sheet date based on viad s stock price until the time of settlement 
viad uses the black scholes option pricing model for purposes of determining the fair value of each stock option grant for which key assumptions are necessary 
these assumptions include viad s expected stock price volatility  the expected period of time the stock option will remain outstanding  the expected dividend yield on viad common stock  and the risk free interest rate 
changes in the assumptions could result in different estimates of the fair value of stock option grants  and consequently impact viad s results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk viad s market risk exposures relate to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and certain commodity prices 
foreign exchange risk is the risk that fluctuating exchange rates will adversely affect financial condition or results of operations 
interest rate risk is the risk that changing interest rates will adversely affect the earnings of viad 
commodity risk is the risk that changing prices will adversely affect results of operations 
viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in canada and the united kingdom and to a lesser extent in certain other countries 
the functional currency of viad s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency 
accordingly  for purposes of consolidation  viad translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into us dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in viad s consolidated balance sheets 
as a result  significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar may result in material changes to viad s net equity position reported in its consolidated balance sheets 
viad does not currently hedge its equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
viad had cumulative unrealized foreign currency translation gains recorded in stockholders equity of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
during and  unrealized foreign currency translation gains of million and million  respectively  were recorded in other comprehensive income 
in addition  for purposes of consolidation  the revenues  expenses  gains and losses related to viad s foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period 
as a result  viad s consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as the operating results of its foreign operations  when translated  may vary from period to period  even when the functional currency amounts have not changed 
such fluctuations may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period to period comparisons 
viad does not currently hedge its net earnings exposure arising from the translation of its foreign operating results 
as noted above  viad primarily conducts its foreign operations in canada and the united kingdom

as the united kingdom operations generated aggregate operating income in  viad s segment operating income has been favorably impacted by  from the strengthening of the british pound relative to the us dollar 
a hypothetical change of ten percent in the british pound exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately  viad is exposed to foreign exchange transaction risk as its foreign subsidiaries have certain revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary 
from time to time  viad utilizes forward contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings related to these transactions due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
as of december  and  viad did not have any significant foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
viad is exposed to short term interest rate risk on certain of its debt obligations 
viad currently does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows for such obligations 
as of december  viad had variable rate debt outstanding of million under the credit facility 
interest payments related to viad s variable rate debt outstanding are indexed to libor 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in short term interest rates of and basis points  viad s income from continuing operations before income taxes would have been lower by approximately  and  respectively

viad s subsidiaries have exposure to changing fuel prices 
periodically  brewster enters into futures contracts with an oil company to purchase two types of fuel and specifies the monthly total volume  by fuel product  to be purchased over the agreed upon term of the contract  which is generally no longer than one year 
the main objective of viad s risk policy related to changing fuel prices is to reduce transaction exposure in order to mitigate the cash flow risk and protect profit margins 
there were no fuel contracts outstanding as of december  or
