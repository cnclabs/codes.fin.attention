the discussion is based upon  among other things  our consolidated audited financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to  among other things  make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent liabilities at the financial statement dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we review our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results are likely to differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions  but we do not believe such differences will materially affect our financial position or results of operations  although they could 
our critical accounting policies  the policies we believe are most important to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  are outlined below in critical accounting policies

overview and recent developments we are a provider of wireless handsets and accessories to carriers  distributors and oems in latin america and asia pacific 
we design  develop  source and sell our proprietary line of products under the verykool brand  which includes entry level  mid tier and high end products 
we first introduced the verykool brand in prior to march and for the past four years  much of our business was distribution of wireless handsets supplied by major manufacturers  primarily samsung and primarily in argentina 
historically  the majority of our revenues have come from our distribution business 
revenue reached its peak in when we recorded million of net sales 
in  of our net sales of million were derived from distribution sales of samsung product to carriers in argentina 
in late  however  a stiff import tariff on certain electronic devices  including wireless handsets  was enacted in argentina 
the tariff had a significant negative impact on our sales beginning in the first quarter of  and ultimately resulted in a decrease of of our sales volume in compared to then  in february  argentina enacted a further import regulation effective march  which essentially resulted in the conclusion of our distribution business 
going forward  we expect our business to be centered on our verykool product line 
our goal is to replace the lost gross profit from distribution revenues with higher margin verykool sales through expansion of our product portfolio and entry into new geographic markets in asia pacific and latin america 
prior to we sourced all our verykool phones from independent design houses and original design manufacturers in china 
in late  with a desire to improve our time to market  better protect our technology and know how and improve our cost structure  we began to search for an experienced management team to serve as the core for an in house design team based in beijing 
in april we recruited a team of very experienced management and technical personnel who now serve as both our design house for all our markets and as the base for marketing and selling our products in asia pacific 
this team currently consists of employees  primarily engineers  located in beijing 
the quarter ended june  was the first full quarter of operation of our china subsidiary 
its expenses are classified as r d expenses on our statement of operations  together with any nre non recurring engineering expenses paid to other design houses 
we shipped our first product designed by our china team to a customer in china in october we expect to continue to use outside design houses to 
table of contents augment the efforts of our china development team 
all of our manufacturing continues to be done by contract manufacturers in china 
areas of management focus and performance indicators we focus on the needs of our customers  developing and sourcing new and innovative products  fostering close relationships with manufacturers  and expanding our business in our current markets and entering into new geographic markets  all while maintaining close attention to operational efficiencies and costs 
we are particularly focused on increasing sales volumes of higher margin products in a cost effective manner to enable us to return to profitability  as well as monitoring and managing levels of accounts receivable and inventory to minimize risk 
performance indicators that are important for the monitoring and management of our business include top line sales growth  cost of sales and gross margin percentage  operating expenses in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenues and operating and net income loss 
we rely upon our in house software management system to exercise real time control over many elements of our business including customer relationship management  purchasing  inventory management and control  sales order control and pricing management 
management and employees spend a significant amount of time traveling to latin america and asia pacific with the purpose of spending time with our beijing design team  key customers  suppliers and employees 
we believe that these relationships are vital to our success and we will continue to dedicate a significant amount of time to this area 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies that  in management s view  are most important in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements also include disclosure of significant accounting policies 
the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the condition and results that we report in our financial statements 
these critical accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies and estimates and assumptions that require the most significant judgment are discussed further below 
revenue recognition and allowance for returns revenues for wireless handset and accessory sales are recognized when i shipment of the products to customers has occurred and title has passed  ii when collection of the outstanding receivables is probable and iii the final price of the products is determined  which occurs at the time of shipment 
sales are recorded net of discounts  rebates  cooperative marketing arrangements  returns and allowances 
on select sales  we may agree to cooperative arrangements wherein we agree to fund future marketing programs related to the products purchased by the customer 
such arrangements are usually agreed to in advance 
the amount of the co op allowance is recorded as a reduction of the sale and added to accrued expenses as a current liability 
subsequent expenditures made pursuant to the arrangements reduce this liability 
to the extent we incur costs in excess of the established cooperative fund  we recognize the amount as a selling or marketing expense 
as part of the sales process  we may perform certain value added services such as programming  software loading and quality assurance testing 
these value added services are considered an ancillary component of the sales process and amounts attributable to these processes are included in the unit cost to the customer 
furthermore  these value added services are related to services prior to the shipment of the products  and no value added services are provided after delivery of the products 
we recognize as a reserve against the related receivables estimates for product returns based on historical experience and other judgmental factors  evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis and adjust our estimates each period based on actual product return activity 
we recognize freight costs billed to our customers in sales and actual freight costs incurred as a component of cost of sales 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we provide for the possible inability to collect accounts receivable by recording an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable on an ongoing basis 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific allowance against amounts due in order to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected  after consideration for accounts receivable insurance coverage we may have 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and our historical experience 
inventory reserves we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventories based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimated forecast of product demand and expected pricing 
we attempt to tightly control our inventory levels and in the recent past have moved more to a build to order model 
however  because we need to place non cancelable orders with our contract manufacturers with a lead time of to days  and because we may not have a confirmed customer purchase order in hand as quickly as we would like to  we sometimes take an inventory risk 
as our products get closer to end of life status  we are more strict about our build to order policy in order to limit our inventory exposure on older product

table of contents year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales for the year ended december   our net sales of million decreased by million  or  compared to net sales of million in the significant decline was primarily the effect of a stiff import tariff on certain electronic devices  including wireless handsets  that was enacted in argentina in november the tariff began to affect our sales beginning in the first quarter of and had a negative impact throughout the year 
in  our samsung distribution sales in argentina declined by million to million from million in distribution sales in the remainder of latin america during fell by an additional million  as samsung began to shift its business to other locally based distributors or distributed directly 
offsetting these declines was an increase in sales of our branded verykool products of million  which represented a increase in sales of those products over in february  argentina enacted a further import regulation effective march  which essentially resulted in the conclusion of our distribution business 
going forward  we expect our business to be centered on our verykool product line

operating expenses and operating income loss from continuing operations for the year ended december   operating expenses of million decreased by million  or  from million in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses declined by million  but this reduction was partially offset by an increase in r d spending of million related to our new development team in beijing that was established in april to focus on our verykool products 
the majority of the sg a decrease was related to reduction of expenses that were variable with sales  which decreased in compared to although we made reductions in other expenses as well  such reductions were not proportionate to the decline in revenue 
in response to the declining sales  we made reductions in headcount  but we were only able to reduce wages and benefits by approximately in compared to the prior year 
in addition  we curtailed marketing spending  but had commitments that could not be terminated  thus marketing expenses declined by in compared to as a percentage of net sales  total operating expenses increased to in compared to in

income loss from discontinued operations during the second quarter of  we assessed opportunities in the united states and mexico and decided to implement actions necessary to close sales operations in both of those countries  which we substantially completed in the second half of  although we generated  in income from discontinued operations during from the salvage sale of remaining inventories 
we are continuing efforts to obtain a refund of the vat taxes prepaid in mexico in connection with our discontinued operations and expect to continue to record adjustments and expenses through discontinued operations as necessary until that process is completed
