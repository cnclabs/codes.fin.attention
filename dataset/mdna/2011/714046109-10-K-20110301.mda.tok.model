overview of fiscal year during fiscal year  we continued to see positive signs of recovery from the global economic contraction across most of our end markets and geographies  in addition to good performance from investments in our ongoing technology and sales and marketing initiatives 
our overall sales in fiscal year increased million  or  as compared to fiscal year  reflecting an increase of million  or  in our human health segment sales and an increase of million  or  in our environmental health segment sales 
the increase in our human health segment sales during fiscal year was due primarily to increased demand for our medical imaging products with the expansion of panel usage for diagnostic  oncology and non medical applications and the easing of capital budget constraints in major hospitals in the diagnostics market  as well as increased growth in the academic sector for both instruments and reagents in the research market 
these increases were partially offset by the impact of lower birth rates in the united states and tight inventory management in state and national labs for neonatal screening in the diagnostics market  as well as continued constrained capital spending within our pharmaceutical customers in the research market  particularly in the area of high throughput screening 
customer consolidations in the pharmaceutical market also had an unfavorable impact on our research business 
the increase in our environmental health segment sales during fiscal year was due primarily to the increase in our onesource multivendor service offering  which we expanded in markets beyond our traditional customer base and services  as well as growth in our environmental  food and consumer safety and testing products 
we also experienced continued growth in traditional chemical markets with the reduction of constraints on capital purchases to rebuild capacity as a result of the cyclical recovery and increased demand after the extended period of delayed capital investment 
in our human health segment  we experienced strong growth in sales in the diagnostics market related to increased demand for our medical imaging products and continued growth in our prenatal offerings within the genetic screening business during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increased demand for our medical imaging products resulted from improved market conditions that lessened the constraints on medical providers capital budgets  allowing us to increase our customer base  as well as expanding into non medical applications 
the performance within our genetic screening business was driven by continued expansion of prenatal screening platforms  with broad based growth experienced across all major geographies  particularly in china with continued expansion of our newborn screening business through our acquisition of sym bio lifescience co  ltd 
sym bio in fiscal year in the research market  demand for our reagents and 
table of contents instrumentation was encouraging in the academic sector 
we saw strong demand for our high end opera cellular imaging systems  enspire plate readers and proprietary alpha detection reagents  which are all specifically developed to address the growing needs of the academic sector 
we are refocusing resources to meet our pharmaceutical customer s evolving needs 
as these customers shift their spending on downstream technologies in pre clinical research  we are well positioned with our in vivo imaging offering  available through our newly acquired visen business 
as the rising cost of healthcare continues to be one of the critical issues facing our customers  we anticipate that even with continued pressure on lab budgets and credit availability  the benefits of providing earlier detection of disease  which can result in savings of long term health care costs as well as creating better outcomes for patients  are increasingly valued and we expect to see continued growth in these markets 
in our environmental health segment  our laboratory services business enables our customers to drive efficiencies  increase production time and reduce maintenance costs  all of which continue to be critical for our customers 
during fiscal year  we continued to grow by adding new customers to our onesource multivendor service offering  which we expanded in markets beyond our traditional customer base and services 
sales of environmental  food and consumer safety and testing products grew in fiscal year due to the continued global need for robust contaminant identification solutions  particularly for trace metals analysis in water 
this trend drove the demand for our inorganic analysis solutions such as our optima and our recently launched nexion mass spectrometer 
we also continued to experience strong demand for quality and safety assurance testing equipment in food and pharmaceuticals throughout the global supply chain 
in addition  we continued to see signs of recovery in our traditional chemical markets with the reduction of constraints on capital purchases to rebuild capacity as a result of the cyclical recovery and increased demand after an extended period of delayed capital investments 
we believe that the need for increased inspection  testing and tracking of contaminants will continue to drive increased demand for our products 
our consolidated gross margins decreased approximately basis points in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to changes in product mix  with growth in sales of lower gross margin product offerings  partially offset by productivity improvements and cost containment initiatives 
our consolidated operating margin improved approximately basis points in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  primarily the result of increased sales volume and cost containment initiatives  partially offset by restructuring activities  increased pension expenses  initial costs on key growth initiatives and the early stage dilution from our recent acquisitions  specifically signature genomic and visen 
we believe we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of the improved spending trends in our end markets and to promote our efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services 
overall  we believe that our strategic focus on human health and environmental health coupled with our breadth of end markets  deep portfolio of technologies and applications  leading market positions  global scale and financial strength will provide us with a strong foundation for continued growth

discontinued operations as part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities  we have discontinued certain businesses 
we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and  accordingly  have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately  and are reflected within the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of january  and january  we recorded the following pre tax gains and losses  which have been reported as a gain loss on disposition of discontinued operations during the three fiscal years ended january  january  december  in thousands gain on disposition of illumination and detection solutions business gain on disposition of photoflash business gain loss on disposition of certain instrument businesses loss on disposition of viacyte sm and cellular therapy technology businesses net loss on disposition of other discontinued operations net gain loss on disposition of discontinued operations before income taxes in november  we sold our illumination and detection solutions ids business  which was included in our environmental health segment  for approximately million  million net of payments for acquired cash balances  subject to an adjustment for working capital as of the closing date 
we expect the divestiture of our ids business to reduce the complexity of our product offerings and organizational structure  
table of contents and to provide capital to reinvest in other human health and environmental health end markets 
the buyer acquired our ids business through the purchase of all outstanding stock of certain of our subsidiaries located in germany  canada  china  indonesia  the philippines  the united kingdom and the united states as well as the purchase of related assets and the assumption of liabilities held by us and certain of our subsidiaries located in singapore and germany

the gain was recognized as a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations 
as part of our strategic business alignment into our human health and environmental health segments  completed at the beginning of fiscal year  and our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities  in december  our management approved separate plans to divest our photonics and photoflash businesses 
the distressed economic conditions during fiscal year adversely impacted our plan to market and sell the photonics and photoflash businesses 
we implemented a number of actions during fiscal year to respond to these changing circumstances and continued to actively market these businesses 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we determined that we could not effectively market and sell the photonics business given the changed circumstances and  after careful consideration  we decided to cease our plan to actively market and sell the photonics business on a standalone basis 
the photonics business was included with the set of businesses which were sold as our ids business  as described above 
in june  we sold the photoflash business for approximately million  including a net working capital adjustment  plus potential additional contingent consideration

in november  we acquired viacell  which specializes in the collection  testing  processing and preservation of umbilical cord blood stem cells 
following the viacell acquisition  our board of directors our board approved a plan to sell the viacyte sm and cellular therapy technology businesses that were acquired with viacell 
we determined that both businesses did not strategically fit with the other products offered by our human health segment 
we also determined that without investing capital into the operations of both businesses  we could not effectively compete with larger companies that focus on the market for such products 
after careful consideration  we decided in the second quarter of fiscal year to shut down the viacyte sm and cellular therapy technology businesses 
we recorded a pre tax loss of million for severance and facility closure costs during fiscal year and recorded additional pre tax losses of million and million related to facility closure costs during fiscal years and  respectively 
during fiscal years  and  we settled various commitments related to the divestiture of other discontinued operations and recognized a pre tax loss of million in fiscal year  a pre tax loss of million in fiscal year and a pre tax loss of million in fiscal year during fiscal year  we reached a settlement with the landlord of a closed facility and recognized a pre tax loss of million

acquisition of analytica of branford  inc in may  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of analytica of branford  inc analytica 
analytica is a leading developer of mass spectrometry and ion source technology 
this acquisition allows us to offer our customers access to critical technologies such as time of flight and quadrupole mass spectrometers and new ion sources that provide more complete information as well as better throughput 
we also gained significant intellectual property in the field of mass spectrometry and ion source technology 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as non capitalizable intangible assets  such as the employee workforce acquired 
we paid the shareholders of analytica approximately million in cash for this acquisition 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we agreed to pay approximately million to the shareholders of analytica as additional purchase price for the election to treat the acquisition as a deemed asset sale 
based on the effect of this election  at the acquisition date we have retrospectively adjusted the fiscal year comparative information 
the adjustment resulted in a decrease in deferred tax liability  included in long term liabilities  of million  an increase in accrued expenses of million and an increase in other current assets of million  offset by a decrease in goodwill of million 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill  all of which is tax deductible 
we have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our environmental health segment from the acquisition date 
allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocation 
the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business  and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets  in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including contingent consideration  are based on management s estimates and assumptions  as well as other information compiled by management  including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques 
contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash 
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values  the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill  or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets 
we do not consider these acquisitions to be material to our results of operations and is therefore not presenting pro forma financial information of operations 
we have also determined that the presentation of the results of operations for each of these acquisitions  from the date of acquisition  is impracticable due to the integration of the operations upon acquisition 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional details 
as of january   the purchase price and related allocation for the acquisitions completed in fiscal years and were final 
for acquisitions completed subsequent to fiscal year  during the measurement period  we will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that  if known  would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date 
adjustments to the initial allocation of the purchase price during the measurement period require the revision of comparative prior period financial information when reissued in subsequent financial statements 
the effect of measurement period adjustments to the allocation of the purchase price would be as if the adjustments had been completed on the acquisition date 
the effects of measurement period adjustments may cause changes in depreciation  amortization  or other income or expense recognized in prior periods 
all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings 

table of contents contingencies  including tax matters we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and  along with other companies  have been named a potentially responsible party prp for certain waste disposal sites 
we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated 
we have accrued million as of january   which represents our management s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters 
this amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements 
these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables  including the stage of the environmental investigations  the magnitude of the possible contamination  the nature of the potential remedies  possible joint and several liability  the time period over which remediation may occur  and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations 
for sites where we have been named a prp  our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute 
we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years 
as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site  these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available 
there have been no environmental problems to date that have had  or are expected to have  a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred  the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 
enzo biochem  inc and enzo life sciences  inc 
collectively  enzo filed a complaint dated october  in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  civil action no 
 against amersham plc  amersham biosciences  perkinelmer  inc  perkinelmer life sciences  inc  sigma aldrich corporation  sigma chemical company  inc  molecular probes  inc  and orchid biosciences  inc the new york case 
the complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with enzo  infringed enzo s patents  engaged in unfair competition and fraud  and committed torts against enzo by  among other things  engaging in commercial development and exploitation of enzo s patented products and technology  separately and together with the other defendants 
enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief 
in  the court severed the lawsuit and ordered enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants 
we subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that enzo s patents are invalid 
in july  the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in enzo s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and  we believe  excludes certain of our products from the coverage of enzo s patents 
summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in january  and a hearing with oral argument on those motions took place in july in january  the case was assigned to a new district court judge and in march  the new judge denied the pending summary judgment motions without prejudice and ordered a stay of the case until the federal appellate court decides enzo s appeal of the judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut in enzo biochem vs 
applera corp 
and tropix  inc the connecticut case  which involves a number of the same patents and which could materially affect the scope of enzo s case against us 
on march   the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit cafc affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment in the connecticut case 
pending further disposition of the connecticut case  the new york case against us and other defendants remains stayed 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to the matter described above  and we are contesting the action vigorously 
while this matter is subject to uncertainty  in the opinion of our management  based on its review of the information available at this time  the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we re measured several of our uncertain tax positions related to fiscal years through during fiscal years and based on new information arising from events during the year that affected positions for those years 
we also effectively settled several income tax audits worldwide 
the re measurements and closure of audits included uncertain tax positions in hong kong  the united kingdom  australia  the philippines  and the federal and certain state governments within the united states 
the net effect of these re measurements and closure of audits  statute of limitations lapses  provision to return adjustments  interest expense accruals  as 
table of contents well as other discrete items  resulted in the recognition of million of income tax benefits in continuing operations during fiscal year and million of income tax benefits in continuing operations during fiscal year during fiscal year  we effectively settled several income tax audits worldwide  including in canada  the netherlands  the united kingdom and the united states covering various years ranging from through the closing of these audits resulted in the recognition of million of income tax benefits in continuing operations and million of income tax benefits in discontinued operations 
tax years ranging from through remain open to examination by various tax jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations  such as singapore  canada  germany  the united kingdom and the united states 
the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction 
we regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits 
we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change  causing a change in management s judgment regarding that tax position  ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority  and or iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 
we are also subject to various other claims  legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities 
although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable  in the opinion of our management  based on its review of the information available at this time  the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at january  should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
however  each of these matters is subject to uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us

the analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected sales by product type for fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions 
the increase in sales in our human health segment was primarily a result of an increase in diagnostics market sales of million and an increase in research market sales of million 
this increase in our human health segment sales during fiscal year was due primarily to the increased demand for our medical imaging products in the diagnostics market  as well as increased growth in the academic sector for both instruments and reagents in the research market 
the demand for our medical imaging products resulted from improved market conditions that eased the constraints on medical providers capital budgets allowing us to increase our customer base  including expanding into non medical applications

the decrease in sales in our human health segment reflects a decrease in diagnostics market sales of million and a decrease in research market sales of million 
this decline in our human health segment sales during fiscal year was due primarily to the decreased demand for our medical imaging products in the diagnostics market  which has resulted from constraints on medical providers capital budgets and a lack of financing availability  as well as government stimulus related order delays in the research market  as many of our customers were redirecting their budgets in hopes of obtaining grants for larger instrument purchases

liquidity and capital resources we require cash to pay our operating expenses  make capital expenditures  make strategic acquisitions  service our debt and other long term liabilities  repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends on our common stock 
our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets  particularly the debt markets 
we anticipate that our internal operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses  capital expenditures  smaller acquisitions  interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock 
however  we expect to use external sources to satisfy the balance of our debt when due  any larger acquisitions and other long term liabilities 
principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include deterioration of sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services  and changes in our working capital requirements 
principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity  increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt  a ratings downgrade that would limit our ability to borrow under our amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market  increases in interest rates or credit spreads  as well as limitations on the availability of credit  that affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis  a decrease in the market price for our common stock  and volatility in the public debt and equity markets

we use the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate 
table of contents purposes  which may include working capital  refinancing existing indebtedness  capital expenditures  share repurchases  acquisitions and strategic alliances 
the interest rates under the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin  or the base rate from time to time 
the base rate is the higher of i the corporate base rate announced from time to time by bank of america  na and ii the federal funds rate plus basis points 
we may allocate all or a portion of our indebtedness under the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility to interest based upon the eurocurrency rate plus a margin  or the base rate 
the eurocurrency margin as of january  was basis points 
the weighted average eurocurrency interest rate as of january  was  resulting in a weighted average effective eurocurrency rate  including the margin  of

during fiscal year  we established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to maintain a receivables purchase agreement with a third party financial institution 
under this arrangement  we sold  on a revolving basis  certain of our accounts receivable balances to the consolidated subsidiary which simultaneously sold an undivided percentage ownership interest in designated pools of receivables to a third party financial institution 
as collections reduced the balance of sold accounts receivable  new receivables were sold 
our consolidated subsidiary retained the risk of credit loss on the receivables 
accordingly  the full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts had been provided for on our balance sheets 
the amount of receivables sold and outstanding with the third party financial institution was not to exceed million  reduced to million in march under the terms of this agreement  our consolidated subsidiary 
table of contents retained collection and administrative responsibilities for the balances 
the agreement required the third party financial institution to be paid interest during the period from the date the receivable was sold to its maturity date 
the servicing fees received constituted adequate compensation for services performed 
no servicing asset or liability was therefore recorded 
in march  our consolidated subsidiary entered into an agreement to extend the term of the accounts receivable securitization facility to december  on june   our consolidated subsidiary exercised the right to terminate the receivables purchase agreement with a third party financial institution  releasing both parties of their rights  liabilities and obligations under this agreement

the amount includes accrued interest  net of tax benefits  and penalties 
we have excluded million  including accrued interest  net of tax benefits  and penalties  from the amount related to our uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments 
capital expenditures during fiscal year  we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year  primarily to introduce new products  to improve our operating processes  to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations  and to develop information technology 
we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 

table of contents other potential liquidity considerations at january   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and an amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility with million available for additional borrowing 
most of our cash is denominated in foreign currencies 
almost all of the amounts held outside of the us are available for repatriation  subject to relevant tax consequences 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 
with the exception of million related to the sale of our ids business  we expect accumulated non us cash balances will remain outside of the non us and that we will meet us liquidity needs through future cash flows  use of us cash balances  external borrowings  or some combination of these sources

in november  we sold our ids business for approximately million  million net of payments for acquired cash balances  subject to an adjustment for working capital as of the closing date 
the divestiture of our ids business is expected to reduce the complexity of our product offerings and organizational structure  and to provide capital to reinvest in other human health and environmental health end markets

we recognized a pre tax gain of million  inclusive of the net working capital adjustment  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result of the sale of our ids business 
the gain was recognized as a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations 
as a result of the sale of the ids and photoflash businesses  we concluded that the remaining operations within those foreign subsidiaries previously containing ids and photoflash operations did not require the same 
table of contents level of capital as previously required  and therefore we plan to repatriate million of cash and have provided for the taxes on the related previously unremitted earnings 
taxes have not been provided for unremitted earnings that we continue to consider permanently reinvested  which is based on our future operational and capital requirements 
the impact of this tax provision in fiscal year was an increase to our tax provision of million in discontinued operations 
we expect to utilize existing tax attributes to repatriate these earnings and expect the taxes to be paid to repatriate these earnings will be minimal 
in november  the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of was enacted and allowed businesses with net operating losses for or to carry back those losses for up to five years 
we had anticipated carrying back losses of up to million at the end of fiscal and classified certain deferred taxes anticipated to be monetized with the filing of the tax return as a tax receivable 
subsequently  we decided not to implement all of the tax deferral strategies previously anticipated  and carried back losses of million from fiscal year to fiscal year as a result  the tax attributes that related to tax deferral strategies not implemented have reduced our deferred tax liability balances  with a corresponding reduction in income tax receivable 
we received a federal income tax refund of million in january and generated general business tax credit carryforwards of million 
in connection with the settlement of an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred at our facility in boston  massachusetts in march  we accrued million during the second quarter of fiscal year  representing our management s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building  including environmental matters  which was damaged in the fire 
we paid million during fiscal year  million during fiscal year and million during fiscal year towards decommissioning the building 
we sold the building on april  net proceeds from the sale were million  and we recorded a pre tax gain of million in operating income 
distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability  creating increased volatility in security prices  widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments 
the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold 
increases in credit spreads  as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable  could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis  which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 
in difficult global financial markets  we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost  or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities 
our pension plans have not experienced any material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets 
as a result of significant losses experienced in global equity markets during fiscal year  although our pension funds had modest gains for fiscal year and fiscal year  we experienced increased pension costs in fiscal year we could potentially experience increased costs in additional future periods for all pension plans 
we may be required to fund our pension plans with contributions of up to million by the end of fiscal year  and we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans 
during fiscal year  we made a voluntary contribution of million for the plan year to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states  to realize the benefit received from favorable tax provisions included in the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  as described above 
during fiscal year  we also made contributions of million for the plan year to our defined benefit pension plans outside the united states 
effects of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board the fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective dates 
unless otherwise discussed below  we believe that the impact of recently issued and adopted pronouncements will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows or do not apply to our operations 

table of contents in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this guidance establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue generating activities 
this guidance provides amendments to the criteria for separating and measuring deliverables and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the amendments in this guidance also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  including information about the nature and terms of significant deliverables  and a vendor s performance within those arrangements 
once adopted  the amendments will also require a company to provide information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about the way the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
we will be required to adopt this authoritative guidance on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements in the first quarter of fiscal year we are evaluating the requirements of this guidance and have not yet determined the impact of its adoption on our condensed consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
this guidance changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements that are essential to the functionality of the product and excludes these products from current software revenue guidance 
the new guidance will include factors to help companies determine what software elements are considered essential to the functionality of the product 
once adopted  the amendments will subject software enabled products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements  such as guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we will be required to adopt this authoritative guidance on certain revenue arrangements that include software elements in the first quarter of fiscal year we are evaluating the requirements of this guidance and have not yet determined the impact of its adoption on our condensed consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the milestone method of revenue recognition 
once adopted  this guidance will allow the milestone method as an acceptable revenue recognition methodology when an arrangement includes substantive milestones 
this guidance provides a definition of a substantive milestone that should be applied regardless of whether the arrangement includes single or multiple deliverables or units of accounting 
the scope of the applicability of this definition is limited to transactions involving milestones relating to research and development deliverables 
this guidance also includes enhanced disclosure requirements about each arrangement  individual milestones and related contingent consideration  information about substantive milestones and factors considered in the determination of whether this methodology is appropriate 
early application and retrospective application are permitted 
we will be required to adopt this authoritative guidance on the milestone method of revenue recognition in the first quarter of fiscal year we expect the adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other postretirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for products that include installation  if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element  we recognize product revenue upon delivery  and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete 
for sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria  we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met 
we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period  or as we render services and the customer accepts them 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long term customized projects  we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates 
further  we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 
warranty costs 
we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale 
warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material incurred in the warranty period 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by i applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible  and ii specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty 
therefore  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
this would reduce our earnings 
inventory valuation 
we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and or manufacture 
we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost 
generally  reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand  or technological obsolescence of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and  when necessary  record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements  or historical trailing usage of the product 
if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels  we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
this would reduce our earnings 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 
business combinations 
business combinations are accounted for at fair value 
acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred and recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses  previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest  in process research and development ipr d is recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally affect income tax expense 
all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings 
the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business  and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets  in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including contingent consideration  are based on management s estimates and assumptions  as well as other information compiled by management  including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques 
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates  the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill  or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets 

table of contents value of long lived assets  including intangibles 
we carry a variety of long lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment  investments  identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill 
we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based  in part  upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows 
we undertake this review i on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets and ii on a periodic basis for other long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished 
any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings 
the goodwill impairment test consists of a two step process 
the first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss  and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit 
we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january or the first day of each fiscal year 
this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered 
non amortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized 
in addition  we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our non amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite  the assets will be tested for impairment 
these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 
through fiscal year  we assessed the annual impairment testing using the analytical sciences and laboratory services  genetic screening  bio discovery and medical imaging reporting units 
we completed the annual impairment test using a measurement date of january  and january   and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment 
while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
employee compensation and benefits 
retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business  and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future  and therefore are subject to estimation 
retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales  research and development  and selling  general and administrative expenses  in our consolidated statements of operations 
we incurred expenses of million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year for our retirement and postretirement plans 
we expect expenses of approximately million in fiscal year for our retirement and postretirement plans 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made 
we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied  to determine service cost and interest cost  in order to arrive at pension income or expense for the year 
as of january   we estimated the expected long term rate of return on assets in our pension portfolios in the united states was and was for all plans outside the united states 
we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets  as well as our current expectations for long term rates of returns for our pension assets 
our management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions  and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate 
discount rate assumptions have been  and continue to be  based on the prevailing market long term interest rates at the measurement date 
if any of our assumptions were to change  our pension plan expenses would also change 
a one quarter percent increase in the discount rate would decrease our net periodic benefit cost by million for fiscal year in the united states and by million for fiscal year for all plans outside the united states 
a one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pre tax pension expense by million for fiscal year in the united 
table of contents states and by million for fiscal year for all plans outside the united states 
we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year under the defined dollar plan feature  our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount  regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree 
our maximum future liability  therefore  cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 
restructuring activities 
our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals 
our pre tax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of i severance benefits to be granted to employees  based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades  ii costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub rental income and iii asset impairments as discussed above under value of long lived assets  including intangibles 
because these accruals are estimates  they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention 
for example  actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance  or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected 
in addition  unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates 
when such changes in estimates occur  they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statement of operations line entitled restructuring and lease charges reversals  net 
gains or losses on dispositions 
when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation  we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition 
this estimate is based on a variety of factors  including current interest in the market  alternative markets for the assets  and other relevant factors 
if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation  we record a loss 
if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation  we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated 
accordingly  we may realize amounts different than were first estimated 
during the fiscal year ended january   we recorded million in pre tax gains from disposition of fixed assets 
we recorded million in pre tax gains from the disposition of discontinued operations 
any such changes decrease or increase current earnings  and are recorded either against the gains on disposition or discontinued operations line items appearing in our consolidated statement of operations 
income taxes 
our business operations are global in nature  and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions 
tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions  and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries 
we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law 
our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions 
any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change 
such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are operational decisions  transactions  facts and circumstances  and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain 
furthermore  our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world 
every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits 
adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change  causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position  ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority  and or iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 
any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts  law  tax rates  tax audit  or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense  our effective tax rate  or our cash flow 
additionally  we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  foreign tax credits  other income tax credits and certain pension accruals 
valuation 
table of contents allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable 
improvements or other changes in our operations  domestically and internationally  could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future 
the release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments  marketable securities and accounts receivable 
we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of january  we use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only  and include derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments 
by nature  all financial instruments involve market and credit risks 
we enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties 
we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
approximately of our business is conducted outside of the united states  generally in foreign currencies 
therefore  the fluctuations in foreign currency can increase the costs of financing  investing and operating the business 
in the ordinary course of business  we may enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third party receivables and payables 
the contracts are primarily denominated in european and asian currencies  have maturities that do not exceed months  have no cash requirements until maturity  and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets 
unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and  for hedges designated as cash flow  the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs and impacts earnings 
we did not have any outstanding cash flow hedges during fiscal year principal hedged currencies include the british pound gbp  canadian dollar cad  euro eur  japanese yen jpy  and singapore dollar sgd 
we held forward foreign exchange contracts with us equivalent notional amounts totaling million at january  and million at january   and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant 
the duration of these contracts was generally days or less during fiscal years  and we entered into forward interest rate contracts in october  with notional amounts totaling million and a weighted average interest rate of  that were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance 
in may  we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling million upon the issuance of our senior unsecured notes  and recognized million  net of taxes of million  of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive loss income 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance  with a notional amount totaling million  was no longer probable 
as a result of the debt issuance no longer being probable  we discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling million and recognized a loss of million in interest and other income expense  net 

table of contents as of january   the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the effective cash flow hedges was million  net of taxes of million 
the derivative losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense 
we amortized million into interest expense during each of the fiscal years and  and million during fiscal year market risk market risk 
we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 
foreign exchange risk 
the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us  as approximately of our business is conducted outside of the united states  generally in foreign currencies 
our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures 
the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures  with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures 
moreover  we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states  material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the united states  resulting in natural hedges 
although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities  when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business  generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted 
foreign currency risk value at risk disclosure 
we utilize a value at risk model to determine the potential earning fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments 
as discussed above  we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program 
our value at risk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation  utilizing a confidence interval and a holding period of days 
as of january   this computation estimated that there is a chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than million 
this value at risk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program 
specifically  during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year  the value at risk ranged between million and million  with an average of approximately million 
interest rate risk 
as described above  our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments 
fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short term cash flows  as they relate to interest  and our earnings 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures 
we entered into forward interest rate contracts in october  with notional amounts totaling million and a weighted average interest rate of  that were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance 
in may  we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling million upon the issuance of our senior unsecured notes  and recognized million  net of taxes of million  of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive loss income 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance  with a notional amount totaling million  was no longer probable 
as a result of the debt issuance no longer being probable  we discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling million and recognized a loss of million in interest and other income expense  net 
as of january   the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the effective cash flow hedges was million  net of taxes of million 
the derivative losses are being 
table of contents amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense 
we amortized million into interest expense during each of the fiscal years and  and million during fiscal year interest rate risk sensitivity 
as of january   our debt portfolio consisted of million of variable rate debt 
in addition  our cash and cash equivalents  for which we receive interest at variable rates  were million at january  our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows i changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt  consisting of million of revolving debt facilities  to fluctuate 
an increase of  or approximately basis points  in current interest rates would cause an additional pre tax charge to our earnings of million for fiscal year ii changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate 
as described above  an increase of  or approximately basis points  in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by million for fiscal year iii changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate
