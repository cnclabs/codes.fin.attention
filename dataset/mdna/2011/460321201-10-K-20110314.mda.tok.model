for additional information  see the description of our business included above in item of this report  as well as item of this report below 
critical accounting policies set forth below is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates that we believe are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  financial condition  and results of operations and which require complex management judgments or estimates and entail material uncertainties 
information regarding our other accounting policies is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
voyage revenue and expense recognition revenues and expenses relating to our rail ferry service segment voyages are recorded over the duration of the voyage 
our voyage expenses are estimated at the beginning of the voyages based on historical actual costs or from industry sources familiar with those types of charges 
as the voyage progresses  these estimated costs are revised with actual charges and timely adjustments are made 
the expenses are allocated over the voyage based on the number of days in progress at the end of the period 
we believe there is no material difference between recording estimated expenses ratably over the voyage versus recording expenses as incurred 
revenues and expenses relating to our other segments voyages  which require no estimates or assumptions  are recorded when earned or incurred during the reporting period 
depreciation provisions for depreciation are computed on the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of our depreciable assets 
various methods are used to estimate the useful lives and salvage values of our depreciable assets 
due to the capital intensive nature of our business and our large base of depreciable assets  changes in such estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations 
drydocking costs we defer certain costs related to the drydocking of our vessels 
deferred drydocking costs are capitalized as incurred and amortized on a straight line basis over the period between drydockings generally two to five years 
because drydocking charges can be material in any one period  we believe that the acceptable deferred method provides a better matching for the amortization of those costs over future revenue periods benefiting from the drydocking of our vessel 
we capitalize only those costs that are incurred to meet regulatory requirements or upgrades  or that add economic life to the vessel 
normal repairs  whether incurred as part of the drydocking or not  are expensed as incurred 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with asc topic provisions for income taxes include deferred income taxes that are provided on items of income and expense  which affect taxable income in one period and financial income in another 
certain foreign operations are not subject to income taxation under pertinent provisions of the laws of the country of incorporation or operation 
however  pursuant to existing us tax laws  earnings from certain of our foreign operations are subject to us income taxes when those earnings are repatriated to the us we intend to permanently re invest   and  of our  and foreign earnings  respectively  and accordingly  have not provided deferred taxes against those earnings 
as described further in item of this report  the jobs creation act  which first applied to us on january   changed the united states tax treatment of the foreign operations of our us flag vessels and our international flag shipping operations 
we made an election under the jobs creation act to have our qualifying us flag operations taxed under a tonnage tax rather than under the usual us corporate income tax regime 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc topic asc clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
asc also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
as of december   our net deferred tax asset liability was reduced to zero as a result of the establishment of a full valuation allowance with respect to our net deferred tax asset during the fourth quarter of the valuation allowance was established as a result of recent losses incurred with respect to our operations taxed at the us corporate statutory rate 
the establishment of the valuation allowance resulted in a higher effective tax rate during self retention insurance we maintain provisions for estimated losses under our self retention insurance based on estimates of the eventual claims settlement costs 
our estimates are determined based on various factors  such as severity of the injury for personal injuries and estimated potential liability based on past judgments and settlements  advice from legal counsel based on its assessment of the facts of the case and its experience in other cases  probability of pre trial settlement which would mitigate legal costs  historical experience on claims for each specific type of cargo for cargo damage claims  and whether our seamen are employed in permanent positions or temporary revolving positions 
it is reasonably possible that changes in our estimated exposure may occur from time to time 
the measurement of our exposure for self insurance liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of loss provisions recorded during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
asbestos claims we maintain provisions for estimated losses for asbestos claims based on estimates of eventual defense and settlement costs 
our policy is to establish provisions based on a range of estimated exposure 
we estimate this potential range of exposure using input from legal counsel and internal estimates based on the individual deductible levels for each policy year 
we believe that insurance and the indemnification of a previous owner of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries will partially mitigate our exposure 
the measurement of our exposure for asbestos liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of the loss provisions recorded during the period 
our estimates and assumptions are formed from variables such as the maximum deductible levels in a claim year  the amount of the indemnification recovery and the claimant employment history with the company 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
derivative instruments and hedging activities under asc topic  in order to consider a derivative instrument as a hedge  i we must designate the instrument as a hedge of future transactions  and ii the instrument must reduce our exposure to the applicable risk 
if the above criteria are not met  we must record the fair market value of the instrument at the end of each period and recognize the related gain or loss through earnings 
if the instrument qualifies as a hedge  net settlements under the agreement are recognized as an adjustment to earnings  while changes in the fair market value of the hedge are recorded through stockholders investment in other comprehensive income loss 
we currently employ  or have employed in the recent past  interest rate swap agreements  foreign currency contracts  and commodity swap contracts 
pension and postretirement benefits our pension and postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by asc topic these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation rates  rate of compensation increases  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuary and information as to historical experience and performance 
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and postretirement obligations and future expense 
we account for our pension and post retirement benefit plans in accordance with asc topic this statement requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans 
under asc topic  actuarial gains and losses  prior service costs or credits  and any remaining transition assets or obligations that have not been recognized under previous accounting standards must be recognized in other comprehensive income  net of tax effects  until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost 
in addition  the measurement date  the date at which plan assets and the benefit obligation are measured  is required to be the company s fiscal year end 
impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying amounts of our vessels for possible impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a particular vessel may not be recoverable 
the carrying values of the our vessels may not represent their fair market value at any point in time because the market prices of vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates  second hand vessel sales and the cost of newbuildings 
we record impairment losses only when events occur that cause us to believe that future cash flows for any individual vessel will be less than its carrying value 
in such instances  we would recognize an impairment charge in the period in which that determination is made if the estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the vessel and its eventual disposition is less than the vessel s carrying amount 
in developing estimates of future cash flows  we must make assumptions about future charter rates  ship operating expenses  and the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels 
these assumptions are based on historical trends as well as future expectations 
although management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate  such assumptions are highly subjective 
for information on recent fixed asset impairment charges  see liquidity and capital resources rail ferry service 
impairment of investments our holdings in marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are thus carried on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in carrying value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the investments are sold 
we review these investments for impairment when there is evidence that fair value may be below the carrying cost 
we write down an investment if fair value is below the carrying cost and the impairment is other than temporary 
if we determine that a material decline in fair value below the carrying cost is other than temporary  we would record a noncash impairment loss in our consolidated statement of income in the period in which that determination is made 
the carrying value of that security would then be written down to its fair value at the end of that period  establishing a new cost basis 
in determining the fair value of an investment and assessing whether any identified impairment is other than temporary  we use significant estimates and considerable judgments 
although management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate  such assumptions are highly subjective 
for information on recent investment impairment charges  see the discussion of our other income and expenses for  and appearing below 

table of contents executive summary overview of overall strategy the company operates a diversified fleet of us and international flag vessels that provide international and domestic maritime transportation services to customers primarily under medium to long term contracts 
our business strategy consists of identifying growth opportunities as market needs change  utilizing our extensive experience to meet those needs  and continuing to maintain a diverse portfolio of medium to long term contracts  under which we can serve our long standing customer base by providing quality transportation services 
consolidated financial performance overall adjusted net income decreased from million in to million for  excluding impairment charges of million in and million in  respectively as described further in the non gaap reconciliation table below 
the decrease of million can be attributed to i a decrease in gross profits of million  ii a non cash foreign exchange loss in of million on our yen facility debt and iii a decrease in our tax benefits of million  partially offset by iv a decrease in administrative and general expenses of million  v a million increase in income from unconsolidated entities and vi a loss on the sale of assets occurring in of million 
key developments include the following decrease in consolidated gross voyage profit was primarily due to a drop in supplemental cargo income partially offset by income from the addition of an international flagged pctc in the first quarter of decrease in overhead expenses of million was primarily due to a charge in related to the repayment of incentive awards to governmental agencies 
non cash foreign exchange loss was due to the strengthening of the yen to us dollar exchange ratio from at year end to at year end lower tax benefits were due to changes in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
increase in income from our unconsolidated entities was primarily due to a gain on the sale of the one remaining panamax bulk carrier in a decrease in of our depreciation and amortization costs discussed further in note w had the effect of increasing our net income by million  or 
per share 
segment performance time charter contracts us flag decrease in gross profits from million in to million in decrease in our supplemental cargo volumes 
time charter contracts international flag improved gross profit results of million 
delivery of new pctc in the first quarter of contract of affreightment decrease in gross profits of million primarily due to a scheduled freight rate reduction 
rail ferry overall improvement in gross profit of million  excluding million impairment charge in continued to operate at maximum capacity on southbound voyages 
improvements in northbound volumes at the end of other net income from unconsolidated entities increased by million mainly due to the sale of the one remaining panamax bulk carrier in the first quarter of financial discipline strong balance sheet operating cash flow increased from million in to million in temporary decrease in working capital current assets less current liabilities from million at year end to million for year end due to final construction payments on three handy size bulk carriers delivered in january permanent financing replenished the installment payments in early cash dividend payments of per share for the fiscal year 
non gaap financial measures in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we refer to adjusted net income and adjusted gross voyage profit  which excludes non cash impairment charges on fixed assets 
we believe this is useful information to investors because it provides comparable information with respect to our financial condition and results of operations excluding such non cash charges 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income and gross voyage profit to adjusted gross voyage profit

beginning with the second quarter  we split time charter contracts operations into two different operating segments  us flag and international flag 
the changes of revenue and expenses associated with each of our segments are discussed within the gross voyage analysis below 
time charter contracts us flag the decrease in this segment s gross voyage profit from million in to million in is primarily due to the decrease in the carriage of supplemental cargoes on our us flag pure car truck carriers  which is partially offset by the reduction in in depreciation expense on our us flag coal carrier from extending its economic life to match the extension of the vessel s time charter contract 
gross revenues for the segment decreased from million in to million in primarily as a result of the decrease in supplemental cargoes 
our fixed revenues of million in and million in represent revenues derived from our fixed time charter contracts  and our variable revenues of million in and million in represent revenues derived from our supplemental cargoes 
time charter contracts international flag the increase in this segment s gross voyage profit from million in to million in is primarily due to more operating days on vessels servicing our indonesian customer  and the initial employment of a newly constructed pctc commencing in late march revenues for the segment decreased from million in to million in due to vessels with lower profit margins ending their service in late and early contract of affreightment the decrease in this segment s gross voyage profit from million in to a loss of  in was primarily due to a decrease in revenues due to a contractually scheduled freight rate adjustment 
although the current results for the segment have decreased  the benefit from a sale leaseback is reflected in a lower consolidated effective tax rate 
rail ferry service adjusted gross voyage profit improved from a million loss in to a million loss for  excluding a million impairment charge recognized in on the segment s two roll on roll off special purpose double deck vessels 
this improvement is mainly due to reduced amortization costs which are discussed further in note w 
in december  we were notified by one of our major northbound customers of their intention to discontinue using the service effective immediately sighting a sourcing decision as their reason for the change 
we were able to offset this loss partially with additional northbound volumes driven by our service being used as an alternative source of transportation resulting from outages in mexico s cross border rail service and a negotiated retroactive settlement to reduce our port costs 
we based the aforementioned non cash impairment charge taken in the third quarter of on our determination that the cash flows expected to be generated by the long lived assets of the rail ferry segment were less than the carrying amount of these assets due partially to the challenge of replacing a major customer lost in late other gross voyage profit for this segment increased from million in to million in this was primarily due to an increase in chartering brokerage income 

table of contents other income and expenses administrative and general expenses a g decreased from million in to million in an increase in executive stock compensation was offset by a charge in related to the repayment of certain incentives received from various alabama agencies 
the following table shows the significant a g components for the twelve months ending december  and respectively all amounts in thousands year ended december  a g account variance wages and benefits executive stock compensation professional services office building expense other consulting fees total fees associated with unaffiliated company s offer to purchase the company 
interest expense increased from million in to million in due to i entering into a new loan agreement in the third quarter of to finance the purchase of two multi purpose vessels that were subsequently sold to an indonesian company and ii higher interest expense due to the incurrence of bank indebtedness in to fund the final installment owed on our international flag pctc newbuilding 
derivative loss in represents the ineffective portion of a derivative contract and the related mark to market adjustment associated with this portion of the derivative 
see foreign currency exchange rate risk on page investment income loss improved from a loss of  in to income of million in due to other than temporary impairment losses taken on certain investments in  higher average cash balances in the first quarter and higher average balances of interest bearing debt securities 
other income from vessel financing increased from  in to million in due to interest earned on a note receivable on vessels sold to an indonesian company in the third quarter of foreign exchange loss in reflects the strengthening of the japanese yen against the us dollar related to the non cash revaluation of our yen denominated loan facility associated with the financing of our international flag pctc delivered in march see item a risk factors 
income taxes for  we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million on million of income from continuing operations before income from unconsolidated entities  reflecting tax losses on operations taxed at the us corporate statutory rate 
for  our benefit was million on million of income from continuing operations before income from unconsolidated entities 
our tax benefit decreased from the comparable prior year primarily as a result of improved gross profits of the company s us flag coal carrier and establishment of a valuation allowance with respect to our net deferred tax asset as discussed below 
as a result of the recent losses on operations taxed at the us corporate statutory rate  we are unable to rely on projections of future taxable income in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets associated with such operations 
accordingly  we have assessed the realizability of such deferred tax assets based on the future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities  which resulted in the establishment of a full valuation allowance with respect to our net deferred tax assets as of december  the establishment of the valuation allowance had a negative impact on our effective tax rate and future changes to the valuation allowance will impact the effective tax rate 
equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  net of taxes  increased from million in to million in the results were driven by our investment in dry bulk cape holding ltd dry bulk  which owns two capesize bulk carriers and has two handymax bulk carrier newbuildings on order for delivery in dry bulk contributed million in as compared to million in included in the results is a gain of million on the sale of the remaining panamax bulk carrier by a dry bulk affiliate 
offsetting dry bulk s favorable results were losses of million and  attributable to our investments in oslo and tony bulkers  respectively see note l

time charter contracts us flag the increase in this segment s gross voyage profit from million in to million in is primarily due to an increase in the carriage of supplemental cargoes on our us flag pure car truck carriers 
gross revenues for the segment increased from million in to million in primarily as a result of the increase in supplemental cargoes 
our fixed revenues of million in and million in represent revenue derived from our fixed time charter contracts  and our variable revenues of million in and million in represent revenues derived from our supplemental cargoes 
time charter contracts international flag the decrease in this segment s adjusted gross voyage profit from million in to million in is due to reduced charter hire rates on two container vessels  with one ending service in august contract of affreightment the increase in this segment s gross voyage profit from million in to million in was primarily due to lower fuel costs in  which was partially offset by a decrease in revenues due to contractually scheduled freight rate adjustment 
rail ferry service gross voyage results for this segment decreased from a profit of million in to a loss of million in  while revenues decreased from million in to million in the weak market conditions had a negative impact especially with the northbound service 
in december  we were notified by one of our major northbound customers of their intention to discontinue using the service effective immediately sighting a sourcing decision as their reason for the change 
this loss represents approximately of total revenue for this segment 
other gross voyage profit for this segment decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses related to our unconsolidated interest in an entity in mexico  an exchange loss on the yen denominated facility revaluation adjustment and a favorable earnings adjustment for one of our owned investments  which increased gross profit and were recorded in other income and expenses administrative and general expenses a g increased from million in to million in a substantial portion of this increase was due to the expansion of our executive stock compensation program initiated in april and the accrual of a contingent liability associated with incentives received from various alabama agencies 
the following table shows the significant a g components for the twelve months ending december  and respectively all amounts in thousands year ended december  a g account variance wages and benefits executive stock compensation professional services office building expense other consulting fees total interest expense decreased from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower principal balances 
investment income loss decreased from  of income in to a loss of  in included in these amounts are recognized impairment losses of  in the fourth quarter of and  in the first three quarters of on the company s investments in marketable securities 
these charges reflect investments in certain equity securities whose market values had been materially impacted by poor economic conditions 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold our stock portfolio and recognized a gain of approximately  on the sale  which is reported as a separate line item under interest and other on the income statement 
income taxes for  we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million on million of income from continuing operations before income from unconsolidated entities  reflecting tax losses on operations taxed at the us corporate statutory rate 
for  our benefit was  on million of income from continuing operations before income from unconsolidated entities 
our tax benefit increased from the comparable prior year primarily as a result of lower results of the company s us flag coal carrier and rail ferry segments  which are subject to the higher corporate statutory rate 
equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  net of taxes  decreased from million in to million in the results were driven by our investment in dry bulk cape holding ltd dry bulk  which owns one panamax size bulk carrier  two capesize bulk carriers and has two handymax bulk carrier newbuildings on order for delivery in dry bulk contributed million in as compared to million in the results included a gain on the sale of one of dry bulk s vessels  a panamax bulk carrier  of approximately million in june 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the more detailed consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere herein as part of our consolidated financial statements 
our working capital which we define as the difference between our total current assets and total current liabilities decreased from million at december   to million at december  the decrease in our working capital was temporary and is primarily related to construction payments on our three handy size bulk carriers delivered in january permanent financing replenished the installment payments in early january cash and cash equivalents decreased during by million to a total of million 
this decrease was due to cash provided by operating activities of million and cash provided by financing activities of million being offset by cash used by investing activities of million 
of the million in current liabilities at december   million related to current maturities of long term debt 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for was generated after adjusting for the items listed in our consolidated statements of cash flows  including non cash items such as i a million impairment loss on two of our special purpose vessels  ii amortization of deferred charges of million and iii an million loss on a foreign currency exchange related to the revaluation of our yen denominated loan facility 
these items were partially offset by a non cash deduction of million from the equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  and deferred drydocking payments of million 
during  we received cash dividends of million from the normal operations of our unconsolidated entities 
net cash used in investing activities of million for included capital outlays of million and the purchase  net of sale  of short term corporate bonds of million  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of million  principal payments received under direct financing leases of million  and cash investments in unconsolidated entities of million 
included in the million of capital payments are million for the final installment payment on an international flag pure car truck carrier delivered in late march and installment payments of million on three handy size bulk carrier newbuildings delivered in the first quarter of we have obtained permanent financing for both of these as noted below 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for included outflows of regularly scheduled debt payments of million  an additional million paid toward principal payment on debt affiliated with the purchase of two multi purpose vessels in  the buyback of shares of our common stock of million and cash dividends paid of million 
these cash outflows were offset by the net effect of i a line of credit draw of million offset by line of credit payments of million  ii a debt payment of million and loan proceeds of million from the refinancing of the us flag pctc  iii loan proceeds of million and subsequent pay off of a bridge loan for million  iv proceeds of million from the final bank draw associated with financing of the international flag pctc newbuilding and v proceeds of million from bank draws on the facility agreement to finance the construction and delivery of three handy size dry bulk carriers delivered in january in  we acquired a built pctc  which we reflagged as a us flag vessel 
the vessel was financed with a three year yen denominated loan with a balloon payment of billion yen due on september  immediately after being delivered to us in september of  we chartered this vessel through august of to a far east based shipping company  which held an option to purchase the vessel at the end of the contract 
a portion of the charter was based on yen capital hire payments which corresponded with our yen debt payments 
on february   the charterer notified us of their intention not to exercise their option to purchase the vessel and did not exercise their option on the due date of february  on february   we negotiated a mutually acceptable early redelivery of the vessel under the time charter 
on march   we entered into a us denominated bridge loan which converted our total outstanding debt of billion yen to approximately million 
on june  we entered into a refinancing loan agreement to establish long term financing on this vessel for million 
as a result of the time charterer s redelivery of the vessel in february  we reclassified on our balance sheet million of net investment in direct financing leases from current assets to vessels in the first quarter of this vessel is currently employed on a long term time charter 
on march  we adjusted our million unsecured revolving line of credit upward to million and extended the maturity date to april  as of december   we had pledged million as collateral for a letter of credit 
the remaining million was available as of december   after a million draw late in the fourth quarter of associated with this credit facility is a commitment fee of 
per year on the undrawn portion of this facility 
we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission which was declared effective on october  we believe this registration statement will provide us with additional flexibility to access the public equity and debt capital markets as needed for accretive opportunities 
for further information  see the form s  filed with the securities and exchange commission on october  we routinely evaluate the acquisition of additional vessels or businesses 
at any given time  we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding additional acquisitions 
we generally do not announce our acquisitions or dispositions until we have entered into a definitive agreement 
we may require additional financing in connection with any such acquisitions  the consummation of which could have a material impact on our financial condition or operations 
stock repurchase program on january   our board of directors approved a share repurchase program for up to a total of  shares of our common stock 
we expect that any share repurchases under this program will be made from time to time for cash in open market transactions at prevailing market prices 
the timing and amount of any purchases under the program will be determined by management based upon market conditions and other factors 
in  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million 
thereafter  we suspended repurchases until the second quarter of  when we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million 
unless and until the board otherwise provides  this authorization will remain open indefinitely  or until we reach the  share limit 
debt and lease obligations as of december   we held five vessels under operating contracts  five vessels under bareboat charter or lease agreements and two vessels under time charter agreements 
the types of vessels held under these agreements include i two pure car truck carriers  two breakbulk multi purpose vessels  three roll on roll off vessels and four container vessels  all of which operate in our time charter us flag and time charter international flag segments  and ii a molten sulphur carrier operating in our contracts of affreightment segment 
we also conduct certain of our operations from leased office facilities 
see item of this report 
we have lease agreements on our offices in mobile  al  new york  ny and shanghai  china  which expire in april  june and june  respectively 
we also have a lease agreement on our office in singapore  which expires in september  with an option to renew for a further period of three years 
debt covenants substantially all of our credit agreements require us to comply with various loan covenants  including financial covenants that stipulate minimum levels of net worth and maximum amounts of debt leverage 
while we currently believe that we have available options to prevent or mitigate such breaches  we cannot be sure that we will be able to implement them timely or at all  or that they will enable us to meet all of our current covenants 
in the unanticipated event that our cash flow and capital resources are not sufficient to fund our debt service obligations  we could be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  obtain additional equity capital  enter into financings of our unencumbered vessels or restructure debt 
we believe we can continue to fund our working capital and routine capital investment liquidity needs through cash flow from operations 
to the extent we are required to seek additional capital  our efforts could be hampered by the recent turmoil in the credit markets 
see risk factors in item a of this annual report 
we presently have variable to fixed interest rate swaps on of our long term debt

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to foreign currency  interest rate  and commodity price risk 
we utilize derivative financial instruments including interest rate swap agreements and forward exchange contracts  and in the past we have also utilized commodity swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures 
we hedge only firm commitments or anticipated transactions and do not use derivatives for speculation 
we neither hold nor issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the fair value of our cash and short term investment portfolio at december   approximated its carrying value due to its short term duration 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates at year end for our investment portfolio is not material 
the fair value of long term debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million compared to a carrying value of million 
the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the borrowing rates applicable to our long term debt at december  is not material 
we have entered into seven interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks  two in september of  one in november of  three in september of  and one in january  in order to reduce the possible impact of higher interest rates in the long term market by utilizing the fixed rate available with the swap 
for each of these agreements  the fixed rate payor is the company  and the floating rate payor is the commercial bank 
while these arrangements are structured to reduce our exposure to increases in interest rates  it also limits the benefit we might otherwise receive from any decreases in interest rates  and our weighted average cost of capital 
the fair value of these agreements at december   estimated based on the amount that the banks would receive or pay to terminate the swap agreements at the reporting date  taking into account current market conditions and interest rates  is a liability of million 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates as of december  would have resulted in a million liability 
commodity price risk as of december   we do not have commodity swap agreements in place to manage our exposure to price risk related to the purchase of the estimated fuel requirements for our rail ferry service segment 
we have fuel surcharges in place for our rail ferry service  which we expect to effectively manage the price risk for those services during revenue from fuel surcharges in for the rail ferry service was million 
if we had commodity swap agreements  they could be structured to reduce our exposure to increases in fuel prices 
however  they would also limit the benefit we might otherwise receive from any price decreases associated with this commodity 
a increase in the price of fuel for the period january  through december  would have resulted in an increase of approximately  in our fuel costs for the same period  and in a corresponding decrease of approximately in our basic earnings per share based on the shares of our common stock outstanding as of december  the additional fuel costs assumes no additional revenue was generated from fuel surcharges  however  we believe that some or all of the price increase could have been passed on to our customers through the aforementioned fuel surcharges during the same period but might have been limited by our need to maintain competitive rates 
our charterers in the time charter segment are responsible for purchasing vessel fuel requirements  thus  we have no fuel price risk in this segment 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm purchase commitments during these contracts mature on various dates during the fair value of these contracts at december   is an asset of  the potential fair value of these contracts that would have resulted from a hypothetical adverse change in the exchange rates would be an asset of  on january   a wholly owned subsidiary of the company entered into a senior secured term loan facility denominated in japanese yen for the purchase of a ceu newbuilding pctc  which was completed and delivered in march the decision to enter into this yen loan was driven by the lower yen interest rates versus the usd interest rates at that time 
subsequently  we entered into a yen interest rate swap designed to cap the interest at 
in june  we received notification that the banking institution would be exercising their option to reduce the yen financing on this vessel from to of the delivered vessel cost 
the loan was fully drawn in march to the full amount available of yen  under current accounting guidelines  since this facility is not denominated in our functional currency  the outstanding balance of the facility as of the end of each reporting period is to be revalued  with any adjustments recorded to earnings 
due to the amount of the facility  we may sustain fluctuations that may cause material swings in our reported results 
as an example  a hypothetical to yen increase or decrease on the exchange rate between the us dollar and yen  which was to yen at december   would impact our earnings by approximately  to million for the reporting period see item a risk factors 
while we believe that these fluctuations may smooth out over time  any particular reporting period could be materially impacted by these adjustments 
there was a appreciation in the yen to usd exchange rate at december  compared to december   resulting in a million foreign exchange loss for the year ended december   reported under interest and other on our consolidated statement of income 
we continue to monitor the movements in the foreign currency markets in order to take advantage of potential opportunities 
during the month of september  the japanese government intervened into the foreign currency market causing a temporary weakening of the yen to usd 
we bought forward contracts to purchase yen to cover our installments due under the facility for the periods december  and march  the rate of exchange for these transactions was approximately yen to usd  with total usd equivalents of  on january  we purchased another million yen to cover the june  installment for to usd  or a usd equivalent of
