item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements about our business and operations  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many important factors  including the factors we describe under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a medical device company focused on developing and commercializing interventional treatment systems for vascular disease 
our primary products  the diamondback pad system diamondback  diamondback predator pad system predator and stealth pad system stealth  are catheter based platforms capable of treating a broad range of plaque types in arteries throughout the leg and 
table of contents address many of the limitations associated with existing treatment alternatives 
we also intend to pursue approval of our products for coronary use 
we refer to the diamondback  predator and stealth collectively in this report as the pad systems 
we were incorporated as replidyne  inc in delaware in on february   replidyne  inc completed its business combination with cardiovascular systems  inc  a minnesota corporation csi mn  in accordance with the terms of the agreement and plan of merger and reorganization  dated as of november  the merger agreement 
pursuant to the merger agreement  csi mn continued after the merger as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of replidyne 
replidyne changed its name to cardiovascular systems  inc csi and csi mn merged with and into csi  with csi continuing after the merger as the surviving corporation 
these transactions are referred to herein as the merger 
unless the context otherwise requires  all references herein to the company  csi  we  us and our refer to csi mn prior to the completion of the merger and to csi following the completion of the merger and the name change  and all references to replidyne refer to replidyne prior to the completion of the merger and the name change 
replidyne was a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing  in licensing and commercializing anti infective products 
at the closing of the merger  replidyne s net assets  as calculated pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  were approximately million as adjusted 
as of immediately following the effective time of the merger  former csi stockholders owned approximately of the outstanding common stock of the combined company  and replidyne stockholders owned approximately of the outstanding common stock of the combined company 
csi was incorporated in minnesota in from to  we engaged in research and development on several different product concepts that were later abandoned 
since  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development of the pad systems 
from to  we conducted numerous bench and animal tests in preparation for application submissions to the fda 
we initially focused our testing on providing a solution for coronary in stent restenosis  but later changed the focus to pad 
in  we obtained an investigational device exemption from the fda to conduct our pivotal oasis clinical trial  which was completed in january the oasis clinical trial was a prospective center study that involved patients with lesions 
in august  the fda granted us k clearance for the use of the diamondback as a therapy in patients with pad 
we commenced commercial introduction of the diamondback in the united states in september we were granted k clearance of the predator in march and stealth in march we market the pad systems in the united states through a direct sales force and expend significant capital on our sales and marketing efforts to expand our customer base and utilization per customer 
we assemble at our facilities the saline infusion pump used with our stealth product and the single use catheter used in the pad systems with components purchased from third party suppliers  as well as with components manufactured in house 
the control unit and guidewires are purchased from third party suppliers 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect our losses to continue but generally decline as revenue grows from continued commercialization activities  development of additional product enhancements  accumulation of clinical data on our products  and further regulatory submissions 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily from the issuance of common and preferred stock  convertible promissory notes  and debt 
financial overview revenues 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of pad systems and other ancillary products 
the pad systems each use a disposable  single use  low profile catheter that travels over our proprietary viperwire guidewire 
the diamondback and predator pad systems use an external control unit that powers the system  while the stealth pad system uses a saline infusion pump as a power supply for the operation of the catheter 
our ancillary products include the viperslide lubricant and vipertrack radiopaque tape 
we also have an exclusive distribution agreement with asahi intecc  ltd 
to market its peripheral guide wire line in the united states 

table of contents cost of goods sold 
we assemble the single use catheter with components purchased from third party suppliers  as well as with components manufactured in house 
the control unit and guidewires are purchased from third party suppliers 
our cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials  direct labor  and manufacturing overhead 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include compensation for executive  sales  marketing  finance  information technology  human resources and administrative personnel  including stock based compensation 
other significant expenses include travel and marketing costs and professional fees 
research and development 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the design  development  testing  enhancement and regulatory approval of our products 
research and development expenses include employee compensation including stock based compensation  supplies and materials  patent expenses  consulting expenses  travel and facilities overhead 
we also incur significant expenses to operate clinical trials  including trial design  third party fees  clinical site reimbursement  data management and travel expenses 
all research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
interest and other income expense 
interest and other income expense primarily includes interest expense net of premium and discount amortization  interest income  change in the fair value of conversion option  net write offs upon conversion option and unamortized premium  decretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants  and gain on investments 
interest expense including premium and discount amortization 
interest expense results from outstanding debt balances  and debt premium and discount amortization 
interest income 
interest income is attributed to interest earned on deposits in investments that consist of money market funds 
change in fair value of conversion option 
change in fair value of conversion option represents the period to period change in fair value of the conversion option associated with outstanding convertible debt 
net write offs upon conversion option and unamortized premium or discount 
net write offs upon conversion option and unamortized premium is the result of the conversion of convertible debt  and includes the write off of the related conversion option and any unamortized debt premium or discount 
decretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants 
decretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants reflected the change in the current estimated fair market value of the preferred stock warrants on a quarterly basis  as determined by management and the board of directors 
decretion was recorded as a decrease to redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants in the consolidated balance sheet and a decrease to net loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
concurrent with the merger  all preferred stock warrants were converted into warrants to purchase common stock and  accordingly  we stopped recording decretion as of the merger date 
gain on investments 
gain on investments reflects the change in the fair value of investments 
decretion accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock 
decretion accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock reflected the change in the current estimated fair market value of the redeemable preferred stock on a quarterly basis  as determined by management and the board of directors 
decretion accretion was recorded as a decrease increase to redeemable convertible preferred stock in the consolidated balance sheet and a decrease increase to the loss attributable to common stockholders in the consolidated statement of operations 
the redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the merger with replidyne 
as such  the preferred stockholders forfeited their liquidation preferences and we stopped recording decretion accretion as of the merger date 
net operating loss carryforwards 
we have established valuation allowances to fully offset our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty about our ability to generate the future taxable income necessary to realize these deferred assets  particularly in light of our historical losses 
the future use of net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on us attaining profitable operations and will be limited in any one year under internal revenue code 
table of contents section due to significant ownership changes as defined in section resulting from our equity financings 
at june   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax reporting purposes of approximately million  which will expire at various dates through fiscal critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect amounts reported in those statements 
our estimates  assumptions and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  excess and obsolete inventory  debt conversion option  stock based compensation  and preferred stock warrants are updated as appropriate at least quarterly 
we use authoritative pronouncements  our technical accounting knowledge  cumulative business experience  judgment and other factors in the selection and application of our accounting policies 
while we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments that we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements are appropriate  these estimates  assumptions and judgments are subject to factors and uncertainties regarding their outcome 
therefore  actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
some of our significant accounting policies require us to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we believe that the following are our critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
we sell the majority of our products via direct shipment to hospitals or clinics 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time of delivery when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer 
we record estimated sales returns  discounts and rebates as a reduction of net sales in the same period revenue is recognized 
costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials  direct labor  and manufacturing overhead 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is an estimate and is regularly evaluated for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer base  age of the receivable balances  both individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts attributed to bad debt are recorded in general and administrative expenses 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we have inventories that are principally comprised of capitalized direct labor and manufacturing overhead  raw materials and components  and finished goods 
due to the technological nature of our products  there is a risk of obsolescence to changes in our technology and the market  which is impacted by technological developments and events 
accordingly  we write down our inventories as we become aware of any situation where the carrying amount exceeds the estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future demands and market conditions 
the evaluation includes analyses of inventory levels  expected product lives  product at risk of expiration  sales levels by product and projections of future sales demand 
debt conversion option 
the fair value of the conversion option is related to the loan and security agreement with partners for growth and has been included as a component of debt conversion option and other assets on our balance sheet 
the monte carlo option pricing model used to determine the value of the conversion option included various inputs including historical volatility  stock price simulations  and the assessed behavior of us and partners for growth based on those simulations 
stock based compensation 
we recognize stock based compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments computed at the date of grant 
the fair value of all stock option and restricted stock awards and units are expensed in the consolidated statements of operations over the related vesting period 
we calculate the fair value on the date of grant using a black scholes model 

table of contents to determine the inputs for the black scholes option pricing model  we are required to develop several assumptions  which are highly subjective 
these assumptions include our common stock s volatility  the length of our options lives  which is based on future exercises and cancellations  the number of shares of common stock pursuant to which options will ultimately be forfeited  the risk free rate of return  and future dividends 
prior to the consummation of the merger  we used comparable public company data to determine volatility for option grants 
expected volatility is now based on the historical volatility of our stock 
we use a weighted average calculation to estimate the time our options will be outstanding 
we estimated the number of options that are expected to be forfeited based on our historical experience 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option 
we use our judgment and expectations in setting future dividend rates  which is currently expected to be zero 
all options we have granted become exercisable over periods established at the date of grant 
the option exercise price is generally not less than the estimated fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant  as determined by management and the board of directors 
the absence of an active market for our common stock prior to the merger required our management and board of directors to estimate the fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting options and for determining stock based compensation expense 
in response to these requirements  prior to the merger our management and board of directors estimated the fair market value of common stock at each date at which options are granted based upon stock valuations and other qualitative factors 
our management and board of directors conducted stock valuations using two different valuation methods the option pricing method and the probability weighted expected return method 
both of these valuation methods took into consideration the following factors financing activity  rights and preferences of our preferred stock  growth of the executive management team  clinical trial activity  the fda process  the status of our commercial launch  our mergers and acquisitions and public offering processes  revenues  the valuations of comparable public companies  our cash and working capital amounts  and additional objective and subjective factors relating to our business 
our management and board of directors set the exercise prices for option grants based upon their best estimate of the fair market value of the common stock at the time they made such grants  taking into account all information available at those times 
in some cases  management and the board of directors made retrospective assessments of the valuation of the common stock at later dates and determined that the fair market value of the common stock at the times the grants were made was different than the exercise prices established for those grants 
in cases in which the fair market was higher than the exercise price  we recognized stock based compensation expense for the excess of the fair market value of the common stock over the exercise price 
following the merger  our stock valuations are based upon the market price for our common stock 
legal proceedings 
in accordance with fasb guidance  we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements related to legal proceedings when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range  and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other  the minimum amount of the range is accrued 
if a loss is possible  but not known or probable  and can be reasonably estimated  the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in most cases  significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded 
our significant legal proceedings are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts in thousands  and  for certain line items  the changes between the specified periods expressed as percent increases or decreases year ended june  year ended june  percent change percent change revenues cost of goods sold gross profit expenses selling  general and administrative research and development total expenses loss from operations interest and other income expense net loss decretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock net loss available to common stockholders comparison of fiscal year ended june  with fiscal year ended june  revenues 
revenues increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  this increase was attributable to an million  or  increase in sales of pad systems and a million  or  increase in sales of supplemental and other revenue during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  supplemental products include our viper product line and distribution partner products 
currently  all of our revenues are in the united states  however  we may potentially sell internationally in the future 
we expect our revenue to increase as we continue to increase the number of physicians using the devices  and increase the usage per physician as we continue to focus on physician education programs  introduce new and improved products  and generate clinical data 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  these amounts represent the cost of materials  labor and overhead for single use catheters  guidewires  control units  pumps  and other supplemental products 
the increase in gross margin from during the year ended june  to for the year ended june  was primarily due to operating efficiencies  product cost reductions  and a favorable product mix resulting in a reduction in shipments of lower margin control units 
cost of goods sold for the years ended june  and includes  and  respectively  for stock based compensation 
we expect that gross margin will slightly decline in the first half of fiscal due to stealth becoming a higher percentage of revenue  as the stealth has higher unit costs compared to the diamondback or predator due to lower production volumes 
in addition  we expect the ramp up of our second manufacturing facility in texas  with higher future production capacity  will temporarily increase production costs but enhance efficiencies over time 
we expect that gross margin in the second half of fiscal will be fairly consistent with fiscal  although quarterly fluctuations could occur based on production volumes  timing of new product introductions  sales mix  pricing changes  or other unanticipated circumstances 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expense was million for the years ended june  and june  our selling  general and administrative expenses for 
table of contents the year ended june  have increased due to building our sales organization  along with increased professional fees offset by lower stock based compensation 
selling  general  and administrative expenses for the years ended june  and includes million and million  respectively  for stock based compensation

research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  research and development expenses relate to specific projects to improve our product or expand into new markets  such as the development of electric versions of the pad systems  shaft designs  crown designs  and pad and coronary clinical trials 
the reduction in these expenses related to the decreased numbers and sizes of pad development projects in fiscal  as well as the timing of those projects 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  and includes  and million  respectively  for stock based compensation 
as we continue to expand our product portfolio within the market for the treatment of peripheral arteries and leverage our core technology into the coronary market  we generally expect to incur research and development expenses above amounts incurred for the year ended june   however  we expect these expenses to remain fairly consistent as a percentage of revenue 
fluctuations could occur based on the number of projects and studies and the timing of expenditures 
interest and other income expense 
interest and other income expense decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  significant changes in interest and other income expense during these periods included interest income

change in fair value of conversion option was  for the year ended june   which was primarily driven by an increase in the market value of our common stock since the convertible debt issuance date 
there was no change in fair value of the conversion option during the year ended june  the change in the fair value of the conversion option represents the period to period change in fair value of the conversion option associated with outstanding convertible debt 
net write offs upon conversion option and unamortized premium or discount 
net write offs upon conversion was million during the year ended june  there were no net write offs upon conversion during the year ended june  net write offs upon conversion are the result of the conversion of convertible debt  and include the write off of the conversion option and any unamortized debt premium or discount

all of our revenues were in the united states 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  this decrease in cost of goods sold 
table of contents resulted in an increase to gross margin of six percentage points  from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  these amounts represent the cost of materials  labor and overhead for single use catheters  guidewires  control units  and other supplemental products 
the increase in gross margin from the year ended june  to june  was primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies  product cost reductions  and a favorable product mix resulting in a reduction in shipments of lower margin control units

interest income decreased by million  from million for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  the decrease was due to million recorded during the year ended june  related to accepting the ubs offer to repurchase our auction rate securities  establishing an auction rate securities put option agreement 
decretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants 
decretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants reflects the change in estimated fair value of preferred stock warrants at the balance sheet dates 
decretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants for the year ended june  was million 
there was no decretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants during the year ended june  because all preferred stock was converted to common stock in conjunction with the merger

table of contents net loss available to common stockholders 
net loss available to common stockholders for year ended june  was million  or per basic and diluted share  compared to million  or per basic and diluted share for the year ended june  non gaap financial information to supplement our consolidated condensed financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap  our management uses a non gaap financial measure referred to as adjusted ebitda 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to the most comparable us gaap measure expressed as dollar amounts in thousands year ended june  loss from operations add stock based compensation add depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda the improvement in adjusted ebitda of million  or  is primarily the result of the million  or  improvement in the loss from operations 
the loss from operations was significantly impacted by increases in revenue and gross margin  and a decrease in operating expenses  as discussed above 
adjusted ebitda was also impacted by a decrease in stock based compensation and increase in depreciation and amortization 
stock based compensation decreased million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  stock based compensation decreased as a result of prior year charges for extending the terms of certain expired stock options 
depreciation and amortization increased as a result of additional investment in capital equipment 
use and economic substance of non gaap financial measures used and usefulness of such non gaap financial measures to investors we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of performance and believe this measure facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by factoring out potential differences caused by depreciation and amortization expense and non cash charges such as stock based compensation 
our management uses adjusted ebitda to analyze the underlying trends in our business  assess the performance of our core operations  establish operational goals and forecasts that are used to allocate resources and evaluate our performance period over period and in relation to our competitors operating results 
additionally  our management is partially evaluated on the basis of adjusted ebitda when determining achievement of their incentive compensation performance targets 
we believe that presenting adjusted ebitda provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management for its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management 
we also believe that providing this information better enables our investors to understand our operating performance and evaluate the methodology used by our management to evaluate and measure such performance 
adjusted ebitda is also used to measure performance in our financial covenants as required by silicon valley bank and partners for growth 
the following is an explanation of each of the items that management excluded from adjusted ebitda and the reasons for excluding each of these individual items stock based compensation 
we exclude stock based compensation expense from our non gaap financial measures primarily because such expense  while constituting an ongoing and recurring expense  is not an expense that requires cash settlement 
our management also believes that excluding this item from our non gaap results is useful to investors to understand its impact on our operational performance  liquidity and ability to make additional investments in the company  and it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense 
we exclude depreciation and amortization expense from our non gaap financial measures primarily because such expenses  while constituting ongoing and recurring expenses  are not expenses that require cash settlement and are not used by our management to assess the core profitability of our business operations 
our management also believes that excluding these items from our non gaap results is useful to investors to understand our operational performance  liquidity and ability to make additional investments in the company 
material limitations associated with the use of non gaap financial measures and manner in which we compensate for these limitations non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with gaap 
some of the limitations associated with our use of these non gaap financial measures are items such as stock based compensation do not directly affect our cash flow position  however  such items reflect economic costs to us and are not reflected in our adjusted ebitda and therefore these non gaap measures do not reflect the full economic effect of these items 
non gaap financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore other companies may calculate similarly titled non gaap financial measures differently than we do  limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes 
our management exercises judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non gaap financial measures we use 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily upon our gaap results and using non gaap financial measures only supplementally 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million at june  and  respectively 
during the year ended june   net cash used in operations amounted to million 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have historically funded our operating losses primarily from the issuance of common and preferred stock  convertible promissory notes  debt  and the merger with replidyne in february loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank on march   we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
the agreement includes a million term loan and a million line of credit 
the terms of each of these loans are as follows the million term loan has a fixed interest rate of and a final payment amount equal to of the loan amount due at maturity 
this term loan has a month maturity  with repayment terms that include interest only payments during the first six months followed by equal principal and interest payments 
this term loan also includes an acceleration provision that requires us to pay the entire outstanding balance  plus a penalty ranging from to of the principal amount  upon prepayment or the occurrence and continuance of an event of default 
in connection with entering into the agreement  we amended a warrant previously granted to silicon valley bank 
the warrant provided an option to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant was exercised in june the balance outstanding on the term loan at june  was million  net of the unamortized discount associated with the warrant 
the million line of credit has a two year maturity and a floating interest rate equal to silicon valley bank s prime rate  plus  with an interest rate floor of 
interest on borrowings is due monthly and the principal balance is due at maturity 
borrowings on the line of credit are based on a of eligible domestic receivables  plus b the lesser of of eligible inventory or of eligible domestic receivables or million  minus c to the extent in effect  certain loan reserves as defined in the 
table of contents agreement 
accounts receivable receipts are deposited into a lockbox account in the name of silicon valley bank 
the accounts receivable line of credit is subject to non use fees  annual fees  and cancellation fees 
the agreement provides that initially of the outstanding principal balance of the million term loan reduces available borrowings under the line of credit 
upon the achievement of certain financial covenants  the amount reducing available borrowings will be reduced to zero 
there was not an outstanding balance on the line of credit at june  borrowings from silicon valley bank are secured by all of our assets 
the borrowings are subject to prepayment penalties and financial covenants  including maintaining certain liquidity and fixed charge coverage ratios and certain three month ebitda targets 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of june  the agreement also includes subjective acceleration clauses which permit silicon valley bank to accelerate the due date under certain circumstances  including  but not limited to  material adverse effects on our financial status or otherwise 
any non compliance by us under the terms of our debt arrangements could result in an event of default under the silicon valley bank loan  which  if not cured  could result in the acceleration of this debt 
loan and security agreement with partners for growth on april   we entered into a loan and security agreement with partners for growth iii  lp pfg 
the agreement provides that pfg will make loans to us up to million 
the agreement has a maturity date of april  the loans bear interest at a floating per annum rate equal to above silicon valley bank s prime rate  and such interest is payable monthly 
the principal balance of and any accrued and unpaid interest on any notes are due on the maturity date and may not be prepaid by us at any time in whole or in part 
under the agreement  pfg provided us with an initial loan of million the initial loan on april  during the three months ended december   pfg  at its option  converted the entire million at par into  shares of our common stock in accordance with the conversion terms set forth in the note for the initial loan 
on december   and january   we issued pfg additional convertible notes under the agreement of million and  respectively subsequent loans 
during the three months ended june   pfg  at its option  converted the million subsequent loan at par into  shares of our common stock in accordance with the conversion terms set forth in the note for the subsequent loan 
on june   we issued pfg an additional convertible note under the agreement of million the current loans 
at any time prior to the maturity date  pfg may at its option convert the remaining  subsequent loan or the million current loan into shares of our common stock at or per share  respectively  which equaled the ten day volume weighted average price per share of our common stock prior to the issuance date of each note 
we may also effect at any time a mandatory conversion of amounts  subject to certain terms  conditions and limitations provided in the agreement  including a requirement that the ten day volume weighted average price of our common stock prior to the date of conversion is at least greater than the conversion price 
we may reduce the conversion price to a price that represents a discount to the ten day volume weighted average price of its common stock to satisfy this condition and effect a mandatory conversion 
as a result of the various note issuances and conversions  we have reflected a net expense of  for the year ended june  as a component of interest and other  net on the accompanying statement of operations which represents the net effect of i the write off of the conversion option on the initial loan and subsequent loan  ii the write off of the unamortized debt premium on the initial and subsequent loan and iii the change in fair value of the conversion options on all loans
