cna competes with stock and mutual insurance companies  reinsurance companies and other entities for both producers and customers 
cna must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services 
rates among insurers vary according to the types of insurers and methods of operation 
cna competes for business not only on the basis of rate  but also on the basis of availability of coverage desired by customers  financial strength  ratings and quality of service  including claim adjustment services 
there are approximately  individual companies that sell property and casualty insurance in the united states 
based on statutory net written premiums  cna is the seventh largest commercial insurance writer and the th largest property and casualty insurance organization in the united states 
regulation the insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout the united states 
each state has established supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relative to licensing insurers and agents  approving policy forms  establishing reserve requirements  prescribing the form and content of statutory financial reports  and regulating capital adequacy and the type  quality and amount of investments permitted 
such regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations  which require that rates not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
in addition to regulation of dividends by insurance subsidiaries  intercompany transfers of assets may be subject to prior notice or approval by the state insurance regulators  depending on the size of such transfers and payments in relation to the financial position of the insurance affiliates making the transfer or payment 
insurers are also required by the states to provide coverage to insureds who would not otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers 
each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks 
cna s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state 
further  insurance companies are subject to state guaranty fund and other insurance related assessments 
guaranty fund assessments are levied by the state departments of insurance to cover claims of insolvent insurers 
other insurance related assessments are generally levied by state agencies to fund various organizations including disaster relief funds  rating bureaus  insurance departments  and workers compensation second injury funds  or by industry organizations that assist in the statistical analysis and ratemaking process 
although the federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance  federal legislative and regulatory initiatives can impact the insurance industry in a variety of ways 
these initiatives and legislation include tort reform proposals  proposals addressing natural catastrophe exposures  terrorism risk mechanisms  federal financial services reforms  various tax proposals affecting insurance companies  and possible regulatory limitations  impositions and restrictions arising from the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  as well as the patient protection and affordable care act  both enacted in various legislative and regulatory efforts to reform the tort liability system have  and will continue to  impact cna s industry 
although there has been some tort reform with positive impact to the insurance industry  new causes of action and theories of damages continue to be proposed in state court actions or by federal or state legislatures that continue to expand liability for insurers and their policyholders 
for example  some state legislatures have from time to time considered legislation addressing direct action against insurers related to bad faith claims 
as a result of this 
table of contents unpredictability in the law  insurance underwriting is expected to continue to be difficult in commercial lines  professional liability and other specialty coverages 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act expands the federal presence in insurance oversight and may increase the regulatory requirements to which cna may be subject 
the act s requirements include streamlining the state based regulation of reinsurance and nonadmitted insurance property or casualty insurance placed from insurers that are eligible to accept insurance  but are not licensed to write insurance in a particular state 
the act also establishes a new federal insurance office within the us department of the treasury with powers over all lines of insurance except health insurance  certain long term care insurance and crop insurance  to  among other things  monitor aspects of the insurance industry  identify issues in the regulation of insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry or the overall financial system  coordinate federal policy on international insurance matters and preempt state insurance measures under certain circumstances 
the act calls for numerous studies and contemplates further regulation 
the patient protection and affordable care act and the related amendments in the health care and education reconciliation act may increase cna s operating costs and underwriting losses 
this landmark legislation may lead to numerous changes in the health care industry that could create additional operating costs for cna  particularly with respect to workers compensation and long term care products 
these costs might arise through the increased use of health care services by claimants or the increased complexities in health care bills that could require additional levels of review 
in addition  due to the expected number of new participants in the health care system and the potential for additional malpractice claims  cna may experience increased underwriting risk in the lines of business that provide management and professional liability insurance to individuals and businesses engaged in the health care industry 
the lines of business that provide professional liability insurance to attorneys  accountants and other professionals who advise clients regarding the health care reform legislation may also experience increased underwriting risk due to the complexity of the legislation

table of contents diamond offshore drilling  inc 
diamond offshore drilling  inc diamond offshore  is engaged  through its subsidiaries  in the business of owning and operating drilling rigs that are used in the drilling of offshore oil and gas wells on a contract basis for companies engaged in exploration and production of hydrocarbons 
diamond offshore owns offshore rigs 
diamond offshore accounted for  and of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended december   and rigs diamond offshore owns and operates semisubmersible rigs  consisting of high specification and intermediate rigs 
semisubmersible rigs consist of an upper working and living deck resting on vertical columns connected to lower hull members 
such rigs operate in a semi submerged position  remaining afloat  off bottom  in a position in which the lower hull is approximately feet to feet below the water line and the upper deck protrudes well above the surface 
semisubmersible rigs are typically anchored in position and remain stable for drilling in the semi submerged floating position due in part to their wave transparency characteristics at the water line 
semisubmersible rigs can also be held in position through the use of a computer controlled thruster dynamic positioning system to maintain the rig s position over a drillsite 
five semisubmersible rigs in diamond offshore s fleet have this capability 
diamond offshore s high specification semisubmersible rigs are generally capable of working in water depths of  feet or greater or in harsh environments and have other advanced features  as compared to intermediate semisubmersible rigs 
five high specification rigs have nominal water depth capability of  feet  one of  feet  one of  feet  five of  to  feet  and one of  feet 
as of january   six of diamond offshore s high specification semisubmersible rigs were located offshore brazil  and two were located in the us gulf of mexico gom 
of diamond offshore s remaining high specification semisubmersible rigs  one was located offshore each of angola  egypt  indonesia and the republic of congo and one was in a shipyard in singapore 
diamond offshore s intermediate semisubmersible rigs generally work in maximum water depths up to  feet 
as of january   diamond offshore had intermediate semisubmersible rigs in various locations around the world 
nine of these semisubmersible rigs were operating in the south america region  including eight offshore brazil and one offshore the falkland islands  three were located in the north sea  two were located offshore australia  one was located offshore vietnam and one was cold stacked in malaysia 
diamond offshore s remaining three intermediate semisubmersible rigs are located in the gom  where two have been cold stacked 
diamond offshore has one high specification drillship  the ocean clipper  which was located offshore brazil as of january  drillships  which are typically self propelled  are positioned over a drillsite through the use of either an anchoring system or a dynamic positioning system similar to those used on certain semisubmersible rigs 
deepwater drillships compete in many of the same markets as do high specification semisubmersible rigs 
diamond offshore has jack up drilling rigs 
jack up rigs are mobile  self elevating drilling platforms equipped with legs that are lowered to the ocean floor until a foundation is established to support the drilling platform 
the rig hull includes the drilling rig  jacking system  crew quarters  loading and unloading facilities  storage areas for bulk and liquid materials  heliport and other related equipment 
diamond offshore s jack up rigs are used for drilling in water depths from feet to feet 
the water depth limit of a particular rig is principally determined by the length of the rig s legs 
a jack up rig is towed to the drillsite with its hull riding in the sea  as a vessel  with its legs retracted 
once over a drillsite  the legs are lowered until they rest on the seabed and jacking continues with the legs penetrating the seabed until resistance is sufficient to elevate the hull above the surface of the water 
after completion of drilling operations  the hull is lowered until it rests in the water and then the legs are retracted for relocation to another drillsite 
as of january   six of diamond offshore s jack up rigs were located in the gom  of which four rigs have been cold stacked  consisting of two mat supported cantilevered rigs  one mat supported slot rig and one independent leg  cantilevered rig 
of diamond offshore s seven remaining jack up rigs  all of which are independent leg cantilevered rigs  two each were located offshore egypt and mexico  and one was located offshore each of brazil and montenegro 
diamond offshore s remaining jack up rig was en route to thailand 
fleet upgrades diamond offshore s long term strategy has been to economically upgrade its fleet to meet customer demand for advanced  efficient  high tech rigs  particularly deepwater semisubmersible rigs  in order to maximize the utilization of  and dayrates earned by  the rigs in its fleet 
in december and january  diamond offshore 
table of contents entered into separate turnkey contracts with hyundai heavy industries co 
ltd  hyundai  for the construction of two dynamically positioned  ultra deepwater drillships with deliveries scheduled for late in the second and fourth quarters of diamond offshore expects total cost for the sister drillships  including commissioning  spares and project management  to aggregate approximately billion 
in addition  diamond offshore has also obtained from hyundai a fixed price option for the purchase of a third drillship  which it has the right to exercise at any time before the end of the first quarter of in june and september  diamond offshore acquired two new build deepwater  dynamically positioned  semisubmersible drilling rigs  the ocean courage and the ocean valor 
including diamond offshore s rig acquisitions in and its two recent drillship orders  diamond offshore has purchased  ordered or upgraded seven rigs with capabilities in  feet of water over the last four years 
markets the principal markets for diamond offshore s contract drilling services are the following south america  principally offshore brazil and the falkland islands  australia and asia  including malaysia  indonesia  thailand and vietnam  the middle east  including kuwait  qatar and saudi arabia  europe  principally in the united kingdom  or uk  and norway  west africa  including angola and the republic of congo  the mediterranean basin  including egypt  and the gulf of mexico  including the us and mexico 
diamond offshore actively markets its rigs worldwide 
from time to time diamond offshore s fleet operates in various other markets throughout the world as the market demands 
diamond offshore believes its presence in multiple markets is valuable in many respects 
for example  diamond offshore believes that its experience with safety and other regulatory matters in the uk has been beneficial in australia and other international areas in which diamond offshore operates  while production experience it has gained through brazilian and north sea operations has potential application worldwide 
additionally  diamond offshore believes its performance for a customer in one market segment or area enables it to better understand that customer s needs and better serve that customer in different market segments or other geographic locations 
diamond offshore s contracts to provide offshore drilling services vary in their terms and provisions 
diamond offshore typically obtains its contracts through competitive bidding  although it is not unusual for diamond offshore to be awarded drilling contracts without competitive bidding 
drilling contracts generally provide for a basic drilling rate on a fixed dayrate basis regardless of whether or not such drilling results in a productive well 
drilling contracts may also provide for lower rates during periods when the rig is being moved or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns  adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond the control of diamond offshore 
under dayrate contracts  diamond offshore generally pays operating expenses of the rig  including wages and the cost of incidental supplies 
historically  dayrate contracts have accounted for the majority of diamond offshore s revenues 
in addition  from time to time  diamond offshore s dayrate contracts may also provide for the ability to earn an incentive bonus from its customer based upon performance 
a dayrate drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering either the drilling of a single well or a group of wells  which diamond offshore refers to as a well to well contract  or a fixed term  which diamond offshore refers to as a term contract  and may be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling rig is destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for an extended period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or  in some cases  due to other events beyond the control of either party to the contract 
in addition  certain of diamond offshore s contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice  and in most circumstances may require the payment of an early termination fee by the customer 
the contract term in many instances may also be extended by the 
table of contents customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time  generally at competitive market rates and mutually agreeable terms at the time of the extension 
customers diamond offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government owned oil companies 
during  and  diamond offshore performed services for  and different customers

as of the date of this report  the greatest concentration of diamond offshore s operating assets outside the united states is offshore brazil  where rigs in its fleet are currently working 
diamond offshore s contract backlog attributable to its expected operations offshore brazil is billion  billion and million for the years  and  and billion in the aggregate for the years to please see md a under item for additional information 
competition the offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants  none of which at the present time has a dominant market share 
the drilling industry has experienced consolidation in recent years and may experience additional consolidation  which could create additional large competitors 
some of diamond offshore s competitors may have greater financial or other resources than diamond offshore 
diamond offshore competes with offshore drilling contractors that together have more than mobile rigs available worldwide 
the offshore contract drilling industry is influenced by a number of factors  including global economies and demand for oil and natural gas  current and anticipated prices of oil and natural gas  expenditures by oil and gas companies for exploration and development of oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs 
drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis 
intense price competition is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job 
customers may also consider rig availability and location  a drilling contractor s operational and safety performance record  and condition and suitability of equipment 
diamond offshore believes it competes favorably with respect to these factors 
governmental regulation diamond offshore s operations are subject to numerous international  us  state and local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its operations  including regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment  requiring removal and clean up under some circumstances  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  and may include laws or regulations pertaining to climate change  carbon emissions or energy use 
operations outside the united states diamond offshore s operations outside the us accounted for approximately  and of its total consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and properties diamond offshore owns an eight story office building containing approximately  net rentable square feet on approximately acres of land located in houston  texas  where its corporate headquarters is located  two buildings totaling  square feet and acres of land in new iberia  louisiana  for its offshore drilling warehouse and storage facility  a  square foot building and five acres of land in aberdeen  scotland  for its north sea operations  two buildings totaling  square feet and acres of land in macae  brazil  for its south american operations and two buildings totaling  square feet and two acres of land in ciudad del carmen  mexico  for its mexican operations

boardwalk pipeline conducts all of its operations through its three operating subsidiaries gulf crossing pipeline company llc gulf crossing the gulf crossing pipeline system  which originates in texas and proceeds into louisiana  operates approximately miles of natural gas pipeline 
the pipeline system has a peak day delivery capacity of bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended december  was bcf per day 
gulf south pipeline company  lp gulf south the gulf south pipeline system runs approximately  miles along the gulf coast in the states of texas  louisiana  mississippi  alabama and florida 
gulf south has two natural gas storage facilities with bcf of working gas storage capacity 
the pipeline system has a peak day delivery capacity of bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended december  was bcf per day 
texas gas transmission  llc texas gas the texas gas pipeline system originates in louisiana  east texas and arkansas and runs for approximately  miles north and east through louisiana  arkansas  mississippi  tennessee  kentucky  indiana  and into ohio  with smaller diameter lines extending into illinois 
the pipeline system has a peak day delivery capacity of bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended december  was bcf per day 
texas gas owns nine natural gas storage fields  of which it owns the majority of the working and base gas  with bcf of working gas storage capacity 
boardwalk pipeline serves a broad mix of customers  including producers  local distribution companies  marketers  intrastate and interstate pipelines  electric power generators and direct industrial users located throughout the gulf coast  midwest and northeast regions of the us competition boardwalk pipeline competes with other pipelines to maintain current business levels and to serve new demand and markets 
boardwalk pipeline also competes with other pipelines for contracts with producers that would support new growth opportunities 
the principal elements of competition among pipelines are available capacity  rates  terms of service  access to gas supplies  flexibility and reliability of service 
due to the construction of new pipeline systems in the us over the past several years  as well as pipelines currently under development  competition has become stronger in boardwalk pipeline s market areas 
many of these new pipelines are in areas outside boardwalk pipeline s service area and are closer to end users than boardwalk pipeline s pipeline systems 
in addition  regulators continuing efforts to increase competition in the natural gas industry have increased the natural gas transportation options of boardwalk pipeline s traditional customers 
as a result of the regulators policies  segmentation and capacity release have created an active secondary market which increasingly competes with boardwalk pipeline s services 
additionally  natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to boardwalk pipeline s customers  including electricity  coal  fuel oils and other alternative fuel sources 

table of contents the new pipeline infrastructure mentioned above is supporting the development across the us of unconventional natural gas supply basins  such as gas shales and tight sand formations 
the new sources of natural gas have created changes in pricing dynamics between supply basins  pooling points and market areas 
as a result of the increase in overall pipeline capacity and the new sources of supply  in the price differentials between physical locations basis spreads on boardwalk pipeline s pipeline systems began to narrow 
this trend continued into basis spreads have impacted  and will continue to impact  the rates boardwalk pipeline has been able to negotiate with its customers on contracts due for renewal for firm transportation services  as well as the rates boardwalk pipeline is able to charge for interruptible and short term firm transportation services 
capacity that boardwalk pipeline has available on a short term basis has decreased as long term capacity commitments on the recently completed pipeline expansion projects have increased in accordance with the contracts supporting those projects 
however  some of boardwalk pipeline s capacity will continue to be available for sale on a short term firm or interruptible basis and each year a portion of boardwalk pipeline s existing contracts expire 
the revenues boardwalk pipeline will be able to earn from that available capacity and from renewals of expiring contracts will be heavily dependent upon basis spreads 
seasonality boardwalk pipeline s revenues can be affected by weather and natural gas price levels and volatility 
weather impacts natural gas demand for heating needs and power generation  which in turn influences the short term value of transportation and storage across boardwalk pipeline s pipeline systems 
colder than normal winters can result in an increase in the demand for natural gas for heating needs and warmer than normal summers can impact cooling needs  both of which typically result in increased pipeline transportation revenues and throughput 
while traditionally peak demand for natural gas occurs during the winter months driven by heating needs  the increased use of natural gas for cooling needs during the summer months has partially reduced the seasonality of revenues over time 
during  approximately of boardwalk pipeline s revenue was recognized in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
governmental regulation ferc regulates boardwalk pipeline s operating subsidiaries under the nga of and the nga of ferc regulates  among other things  the rates and charges for the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce and the extension  enlargement or abandonment of facilities under its jurisdiction 
where required  boardwalk pipeline s operating subsidiaries hold certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by ferc covering certain of their facilities  activities and services 
the maximum rates that may be charged by boardwalk pipeline for all aspects of the gas transportation services it provides are established through ferc s cost of service rate making process 
the maximum rates that may be charged by boardwalk pipeline for storage services on texas gas  with the exception of services associated with a portion of the working gas capacity on that system  are also established through ferc s cost of service rate making process 
key determinants in ferc s cost of service rate making process are the costs of providing service  the volumes of gas being transported  the rate design  the allocation of costs between services  the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn 
ferc has authorized gulf south to charge market based rates for its firm and interruptible storage 
texas gas is authorized to charge market based rates for the firm and interruptible storage services associated with approximately bcf of its storage capacity 
neither gulf south nor texas gas has an obligation to file a new rate case 
gulf crossing has an obligation to file either a rate case or a cost and revenue study by the end of the first quarter of to justify its rates 
boardwalk pipeline is also regulated by the dot under the natural gas pipeline safety act of  as amended by title i of the pipeline safety act of  which regulates safety requirements in the design  construction  operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipelines 
boardwalk pipeline has received authority from the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa  an agency of dot  to operate certain pipeline assets under special permits that will allow it to operate those assets at higher than normal operating pressures of up to of the pipe s specified minimum yield strength smys 
operating at the higher than normal operating pressures will allow each of these pipelines to transport all of the volumes boardwalk pipeline has contracted for with its customers 
phmsa retains discretion whether to grant or maintain authority for boardwalk pipeline to operate these pipelines at higher pressures 
boardwalk pipeline s operations are also subject to extensive federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment 
such regulations impose  among other things  restrictions  liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation  handling  use  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste and in connection with spills  releases and emissions of various substances into the environment 
environmental regulations also require that boardwalk pipeline s facilities  sites and other properties be operated  maintained  abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities 

table of contents properties boardwalk pipeline is headquartered in approximately  square feet of leased office space located in houston  texas 
boardwalk pipeline also has approximately  square feet of office space in owensboro  kentucky in a building that it owns 
boardwalk pipeline s operating subsidiaries own their respective pipeline systems in fee 
however  substantial portions of these systems are constructed and maintained on property owned by others pursuant to rights of way  easements  permits  licenses or consents

risk factors 
our business faces many risks 
we have described below some of the more significant risks which we and our subsidiaries face 
there may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be significant that may also impact our business or the business of our subsidiaries 
each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows  financial condition or equity and or the business  results of operations  financial condition or equity of one or more of our subsidiaries 
you should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports we may file with the sec or make available to the public before investing in any securities issued by us 
our subsidiaries  cna financial corporation  diamond offshore drilling  inc and boardwalk pipeline partners  lp  are public companies and file reports with the sec 
you are also cautioned to carefully review and consider the information contained in the reports filed by those subsidiaries before investing in any of their securities 

table of contents risks related to us and our subsidiary  cna financial corporation if cna determines that its recorded loss reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims  cna may need to increase its loss reserves 
cna maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses  including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process  for reported and unreported claims and for future policy benefits 
reserves represent cna s best estimate at a given point in time 
insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates derived by cna  generally utilizing a variety of reserve estimation techniques from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events  many of which are highly uncertain  such as estimates of claims severity  frequency of claims  mortality  morbidity  expected interest rates  inflation  claims handling  case reserving policies and procedures  underwriting and pricing policies  changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement 
many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and require significant judgment on cna s part 
as trends in underlying claims develop  particularly in so called long tail or long duration coverages  cna is sometimes required to add to its reserves 
this is called unfavorable net prior year development and results in a charge to earnings in the amount of the added reserves  recorded in the period the change in estimate is made 
these charges can be substantial 
cna is also subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change 
these issues have had  and may continue to have  a negative effect on cna s business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims  resulting in further increases in cna s reserves which can have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and equity 
the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict 
examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include the effects of recessionary economic conditions  which have resulted in an increase in the number and size of claims due to corporate failures  these claims include both directors and officers d o and errors and omissions e o insurance claims  class action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices  and mass tort claims  including bodily injury claims related to welding rods  benzene  lead  noise induced hearing loss  injuries from various medical products including pharmaceuticals  and various other chemical and radiation exposure claims 
in light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels  cna reviews and changes its reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled 
if estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason  the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against earnings for the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient 
these charges could be substantial 
cna has exposure related to asbestos and environmental pollution a ep claims  which could result in additional losses 
cna s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries also have exposures related to a ep claims 
cna s experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to a ep claims are subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims 
additionally  traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for a ep 
as a result  estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported a ep claims is subject to a higher degree of variability 
on august   cna completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of its legacy a ep liabilities were ceded to national indemnity company nico  a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway inc  subject to an aggregate limit of billion loss portfolio transfer 
if the other parties to the loss portfolio transfer do not fully perform their obligations  cna s liabilities for a ep claims covered by the loss portfolio transfer exceed the aggregate limit of billion  or cna determines it has exposures to a ep claims not covered by the loss 
table of contents portfolio transfer  cna may need to increase its recorded reserves which would result in a charge against cna s earnings 
these charges could be substantial 
catastrophe losses are unpredictable 
catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of cna s business 
various events can cause catastrophe losses 
these events can be natural or man made  and may include hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  hail  severe winter weather  fires  and acts of terrorism  and their frequency and severity are inherently unpredictable 
in addition  longer term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change  a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures  and includes effects on global weather patterns  greenhouse gases  sea  land and air temperatures  sea levels  rain and snow 
the extent of cna s losses from catastrophes is a function of both the total amount of its insured exposures in the affected areas and the frequency and severity of the events themselves 
in addition  as in the case of catastrophe losses generally  it can take a long time for the ultimate cost to cna to be finally determined 
as cna s claim experience develops on a particular catastrophe  cna may be required to adjust its reserves  or take unfavorable development  to reflect revised estimates of the total cost of claims 
cna s premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and cost of reinsurance 
cna purchases reinsurance to help manage its exposure to risk 
under cna s reinsurance arrangements  another insurer assumes a specified portion of cna s claim and claim adjustment expenses in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums 
market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection cna purchases  which affects the level of its business and profitability  as well as the level and types of risk cna retains 
if cna is unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost it deems acceptable  cna may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of its underwriting commitments 
cna may not be able to collect amounts owed to it by reinsurers 
cna has significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables in its balance sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves 
the ceding of insurance does not  however  discharge cna s primary liability for claims 
as a result  cna is subject to credit risk relating to its ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers 
certain of cna s reinsurance carriers have experienced deteriorating financial condition or have been downgraded by rating agencies 
in addition  reinsurers could dispute amounts which cna believes are due to it 
if cna is not able to collect the amounts due from reinsurers  its incurred losses will be higher 
cna s key assumptions used to determine reserves and deferred acquisition costs for its long term care product offerings could vary significantly from actual experience 
cna s reserves and deferred acquisition costs for its long term care product offerings are based on certain key assumptions including morbidity  which is the frequency and severity of illness  sickness and diseases contracted  policy persistency  which is the percentage of policies remaining in force  interest rates and future health care cost trends 
if actual experience differs from these assumptions  the deferred acquisition cost asset may not be fully realized and the reserves may not be adequate  requiring cna to add to reserves  or take unfavorable development 
cna has incurred and may continue to incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from volatility in the capital and credit markets 
cna s portfolio is exposed to various risks  such as interest rate  credit and currency risks  many of which are unpredictable 
investment returns are an important part of cna s overall profitability 
general economic conditions  changes in financial markets such as fluctuations in interest rates  long term periods of low interest rates  credit conditions and currency  commodity and stock prices  including the short and long term effects of losses in relation to asset backed securities  and many other factors beyond cna s control can adversely affect the value of its investments and the realization of investment income 
further  cna invests a portion of its assets in equity securities and limited partnerships which are subject to greater market volatility than its fixed income investments 
limited partnership 
table of contents investments generally present greater market volatility  higher illiquidity  and greater risk than fixed income investments 
as a result of all of these factors  cna may not realize an adequate return on its investments  may incur losses on sales of its investments  and may be required to write down the value of its investments 
cna s valuation of investments and impairment of securities requires significant judgment 
cna exercises significant judgment in analyzing and validating fair values  primarily provided by third parties  for securities in its investment portfolio including those that are not regularly traded 
cna also exercises significant judgment in determining whether the impairment of particular investments is temporary or other than temporary 
securities with exposure to residential and commercial mortgage and other loan collateral can be particularly sensitive to fairly small changes in actual collateral performance and assumptions as to future collateral performance 
due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these types of risks and the resulting judgments  cna may incur unrealized losses and conclude that other than temporary write downs of its investments are required 
cna is subject to capital adequacy requirements and  if it is unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements  regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit cna from operating its business 
insurance companies such as cna are subject to risk based capital standards set by state regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention 
these standards apply specified risk factors to various asset  premium and reserve components of cna s statutory capital and surplus reported in cna s statutory basis of accounting financial statements 
current rules require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the risk based capital formula 
if cna does not meet these minimum requirements  state regulators may restrict or prohibit it from operating its business 
if cna is required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimates or circumstances or if it incurs significant unrealized losses related to its investment portfolio  cna may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless it is able to raise sufficient additional capital 
examples of events leading cna to record a material charge against earnings include impairment of its investments or unexpectedly poor claims experience 
while we have provided cna with substantial amounts of capital in prior years 
we may be restricted in our ability or may not be willing to provide additional capital support to cna in the future 
if cna is in need of additional capital  cna may be required to secure this funding from sources other than us 
cna may be limited in its ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all 
cna s insurance subsidiaries  upon whom cna depends for dividends in order to fund its working capital needs  are limited by state regulators in their ability to pay dividends 
cna is a holding company and is dependent upon dividends  loans and other sources of cash from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations 
ordinary dividend payments or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries domiciliary state departments of insurance are generally limited to amounts determined by formula which varies by state 
the formula for the majority of the states is the greater of of the prior year statutory surplus or the prior year statutory net income  less the aggregate of all dividends paid during the twelve months prior to the date of payment 
some states  however  have an additional stipulation that dividends cannot exceed the prior year s earned surplus 
if cna is restricted  by regulatory rule or otherwise  from paying or receiving inter company dividends  cna may not be able to fund its working capital needs and debt service requirements from available cash 
as a result  cna would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all 
rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of cna and thereby adversely affect its ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all 
ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
cna s insurance company subsidiaries  as well as cna s public debt  are rated by rating agencies  namely  am best company am best  moody s investors service  inc moody s and standard poor s 
ratings reflect the rating agency s opinions of an insurance company s or insurance holding company s financial strength  capital adequacy  operating performance  strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders 

table of contents due to the intense competitive environment in which cna operates  the uncertainty in determining reserves and the potential for cna to take material unfavorable development in the future  and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies  the rating agencies may take action to lower cna s ratings in the future 
if cna s property and casualty insurance financial strength ratings are downgraded below current levels  cna s business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the severity of the impact on cna s business is dependent on the level of downgrade and  for certain products  which rating agency takes the rating action 
among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers  the inability to sell a material volume of cna s insurance products to certain markets  and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves 
in addition  it is possible that a lowering of our corporate debt ratings by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse impact on cna s ratings  independent of any change in cna s circumstances 
cna has entered into several settlement agreements and assumed reinsurance contracts that require collateralization of future payment obligations and assumed reserves if its ratings or other specific criteria fall below certain thresholds 
the ratings triggers are generally more than one level below cna s current ratings 
risks related to us and our subsidiary  diamond offshore drilling  inc diamond offshore s business depends on the level of activity in the oil and gas industry  which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices 
diamond offshore s business depends on the level of activity in offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production in markets worldwide 
worldwide demand for oil and gas  oil and gas prices  market expectations of potential changes in these prices and a variety of political and economic factors significantly affect this level of activity 
however  higher or lower commodity demand and prices do not necessarily translate into increased or decreased drilling activity since diamond offshore s customers project development time  reserve replacement needs  as well as expectations of future commodity demand and prices all combine to affect demand for diamond offshore s rigs 
oil and gas prices have been  and are expected to continue to be  extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond diamond offshore s control  including worldwide demand for oil and gas  the level of economic activity in energy consuming markets  the worldwide economic environment or economic trends  such as recessions  the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  commonly called opec  to set and maintain production levels and pricing  the level of production in non opec countries  the worldwide political and military environment  including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities in the middle east  other oil producing regions or other geographic areas or further acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere  civil unrest  the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and gas  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  the rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves  available pipeline and other oil and gas transportation capacity  the ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital  
table of contents weather conditions in the united states and elsewhere  the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves  development and exploitation of alternative fuels  competition for customers drilling budgets from land based energy markets around the world  domestic and foreign tax policy  and advances in exploration and development technology 
the aftermath of the moratorium on offshore drilling in the us gulf of mexico and new regulations adopted as a result of the investigation into the macondo well blowout could negatively impact diamond offshore 
on april   the macondo well operated by bp plc and drilled by transocean ltd in the gom experienced a blowout and immediately began flowing oil into the gom the macondo incident 
efforts to permanently plug and abandon the well and contain the spill were successfully completed in september in the near term aftermath of the macondo incident  on may   the us government imposed a six month moratorium on certain drilling activities in water deeper than feet in the gom and subsequently implemented enhanced safety requirements applicable to all drilling operations in the gom  including operations in water shallower than feet 
on october   the us government lifted the moratorium subject to compliance with enhanced safety requirements including those set forth in notices to lessees ntl n and n  both of which were implemented during the drilling ban 
currently  all operations in the gom are required to comply with the interim final rule to enhance safety measures for energy development on the outer continental shelf drilling safety rule and the workplace safety rule on safety and environmental management systems  both of which were issued on september   as well as ntl n known as the compliance and review ntl 
diamond offshore continues to evaluate these new measures to ensure that its rigs and equipment are in full compliance  where applicable 
additional requirements could be forthcoming based on further recommendations by regulatory agencies investigating the macondo incident  as well as restructuring within the department of the interior and the bureau of ocean energy management  regulation and enforcement boemre 
diamond offshore is not able to predict the likelihood  nature or extent of additional rulemaking  nor is diamond offshore able to predict when the boemre will issue drilling permits to diamond offshore s customers 
diamond offshore is not able to predict the future impact of these events on its operations 
even with the drilling ban lifted  requirements regarding certain deepwater drilling activities may remain uncertain until the boemre resumes its regular permitting of those activities 
the current and future regulatory environment in the gom could result in a number of rigs being  or becoming available to be  moved to locations outside of the gom  which could potentially put downward pressure on global dayrates and adversely affect diamond offshore s ability to contract its floating rigs that are currently not contracted or coming off contract 
additional governmental regulations concerning licensing  taxation  equipment specifications  training requirements or other matters could increase the costs of diamond offshore s operations  and escalating costs borne by its customers  along with permitting delays  could reduce exploration activity in the gom and therefore demand for diamond offshore s services 
in addition  insurance costs across the industry are expected to increase as a result of the macondo incident  and in the future certain insurance coverage is likely to become more costly  and may become less available or not available at all 
diamond offshore s industry is cyclical 
diamond offshore s industry has historically been cyclical 
there have been periods of lower demand  excess rig supply and low dayrates followed by periods of high demand  short rig supply and high dayrates 
diamond offshore cannot predict the timing or duration of such business cycles 
periods of excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in rigs being idle for long periods of time 
in response to a contraction in demand for its services  diamond offshore has cold stacked seven of its rigs as of the date of this report 
diamond offshore also may be required to idle additional rigs or to enter into lower rate contracts 
prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates could also result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain of diamond offshore s drilling rigs if future cash 
table of contents flow estimates  based upon information available to management at the time  indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable 
significant new rig construction and upgrades of existing drilling rigs could intensify price competition 
as of the date of this report  based on analyst reports  diamond offshore believes that there are approximately jack up rigs and floaters on order and scheduled for delivery between and the resulting increases in rig supply could be sufficient to further depress rig utilization and intensify price competition from both existing competitors  as well as new entrants into the offshore drilling market 
as of the date of this report  not all of the rigs currently under construction have been contracted for future work  which may further intensify price competition as scheduled delivery dates occur 
the majority of the floaters on order are dynamically positioned drilling rigs  which further increases competition with diamond offshore s fleet in certain circumstances  depending on customer requirements 
diamond offshore can provide no assurance that its current backlog of contract drilling revenue will be ultimately realized 
as of february   diamond offshore s contract drilling backlog was approximately billion for contracted future work extending  in some cases  until generally  contract backlog only includes future revenues under firm commitments  however  from time to time  diamond offshore may report anticipated commitments for which definitive agreements have not yet been  but are expected to be  executed 
diamond offshore can provide no assurance that it will be able to perform under these contracts due to events beyond its control or that diamond offshore will be able to ultimately execute a definitive agreement in cases where one does not currently exist 
in addition  diamond offshore can provide no assurance that its customers will be able to or willing to fulfill their contractual commitments 
diamond offshore s inability to perform under its contractual obligations or to execute definitive agreements or its customers inability to fulfill their contractual commitments may have a material adverse effect on diamond offshore s business 
diamond offshore relies heavily on a relatively small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer and or a dispute that leads to the loss of a customer could have a material adverse impact on its financial results 
diamond offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government owned oil companies 
however  the number of potential customers has decreased in recent years as a result of mergers among the major international oil companies and large independent oil companies 
in  diamond offshore s five largest customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately of its consolidated revenues 
diamond offshore expects petrobras  which accounted for approximately of diamond offshore s consolidated revenues in and ogx  which accounted for approximately of diamond offshore s consolidated revenues in  to continue to be significant customers in diamond offshore s contract drilling backlog  as of the date of this report  includes billion  or of its contracted backlog for  which is attributable to contracts with petrobras and ogx for operations offshore brazil in while it is normal for diamond offshore s customer base to change over time as work programs are completed  the loss of any major customer may have a material adverse effect on diamond offshore s business 
the terms of diamond offshore s dayrate drilling contracts may limit its ability to attain profitability in a declining market or to benefit from increasing dayrates in an improving market 
the duration of offshore drilling contracts is generally determined by customer requirements and  to a lesser extent  the respective management strategies of the offshore drilling contractors 
in periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs  drilling contractors generally prefer longer term contracts  but often at flat or slightly lower dayrates  to preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization  while customers prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly obtain the benefit of lower dayrates 
conversely  in periods of rising demand for offshore rigs  contractors typically prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly profit from increasing dayrates 
in contrast  during these periods customers with reasonably definite drilling programs typically prefer longer term contracts to maintain dayrate prices at a consistent level 
an inability to obtain longer term contracts in a declining market or to fully benefit from increasing dayrates in an improving market through shorter term contracts may limit diamond offshore s profitability 

table of contents contracts for diamond offshore s drilling rigs are generally fixed dayrate contracts  and increases in diamond offshore s operating costs could adversely affect the profitability on those contracts 
diamond offshore s contracts for its drilling rigs provide for the payment of a fixed dayrate per rig operating day  although some contracts do provide for a limited escalation in dayrate due to increased operating costs incurred by diamond offshore 
many of diamond offshore s operating costs  such as labor costs  are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond diamond offshore s control 
the gross margin that diamond offshore realizes on these fixed dayrate contracts will fluctuate based on variations in diamond offshore s operating costs over the terms of the contracts 
in addition  for contracts with dayrate escalation clauses  diamond offshore may be unable to recover increased or unforeseen costs from its customers 
diamond offshore s drilling contracts may be terminated due to events beyond its control 
diamond offshore s customers may terminate some of their drilling contracts if the drilling rig is destroyed or lost or if diamond offshore has to suspend drilling operations for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of major equipment or  in some cases  due to other events beyond the control of either party 
in addition  some of diamond offshore s drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract after specified notice periods by tendering contractually specified termination amounts 
these termination payments may not fully compensate diamond offshore for the loss of a contract 
in addition  the early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time 
during periods of depressed market conditions  diamond offshore may be subject to an increased risk of its customers seeking to repudiate their contracts 
diamond offshore s customers ability to perform their obligations under drilling contracts may also be adversely affected by restricted credit markets and the economic downturn 
diamond offshore s business involves numerous operating hazards which could expose it to significant losses and significant damage claims 
diamond offshore is not fully insured against all of these risks and its contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect diamond offshore 
diamond offshore s operations are subject to the significant hazards inherent in drilling for oil and gas offshore  such as blowouts  reservoir damage  loss of production  loss of well control  unstable or faulty sea floor conditions  fires and natural disasters such as hurricanes 
the occurrence of any of these types of events could result in the suspension of drilling operations  damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury or death to rig personnel  damage to producing or potentially productive oil and gas formations  and oil spillage  oil leaks  well blowouts and extensive uncontrolled fires  any of which could cause significant environmental damage 
in addition  offshore drilling operations are subject to perils peculiar to marine operations  including capsizing  grounding  collision and loss or damage from severe weather 
diamond offshore maintains liability insurance  which includes coverage for environmental damage  however  because of contractual provisions and policy limits  its insurance coverage may not adequately cover diamond offshore s losses and claim costs 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks are generally not fully insurable when they are determined to be the result of criminal acts 
also  diamond offshore does not typically purchase loss of hire insurance to cover lost revenues when a rig is unable to work 
operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns  abnormal drilling conditions  failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services or personnel shortages 
generally diamond offshore s contracts with its customers contain contractual rights to indemnity from its customer for  among other things  pollution originating from the well  while diamond offshore retains responsibility for pollution originating from the rig 
however  diamond offshore s contractual rights to indemnification may be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts of commission or omission by diamond offshore  its subcontractors and or suppliers and its customers may dispute  or be unable to meet  their contractual indemnification obligations to diamond offshore 
diamond offshore believes that the policy limit under its marine liability insurance is within the range that is customary for companies of diamond offshore s size in the offshore drilling industry and is appropriate for its business 
however  if an accident or other event occurs that exceeds diamond offshore s coverage limits or is not an insurable event under its insurance policies  or is not fully covered by contractual indemnity  it could have a material adverse effect 
table of contents on diamond offshore s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
there can be no assurance that diamond offshore will continue to carry the insurance it currently maintains  that its insurance will cover all types of losses or that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify diamond offshore will necessarily be financially able to indemnify diamond offshore against all of these risks 
in addition  no assurance can be made that diamond offshore will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers to be reasonable or that diamond offshore will be able to obtain insurance against some risks 
diamond offshore has elected to self insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the gom 
because the amount of insurance coverage available to diamond offshore has been limited  and the cost for such coverage has increased substantially  diamond offshore has elected to self insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the gom 
this results in a higher risk of losses  which could be material  that are not covered by third party insurance contracts 
a significant portion of diamond offshore s operations are conducted outside the united states and involve additional risks not associated with domestic operations 
diamond offshore operates in various regions throughout the world that may expose it to political and other uncertainties  including risks of terrorist acts  war and civil disturbances  piracy or assaults on property or personnel  kidnapping of personnel  expropriation of property or equipment  renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts  changing political conditions  foreign and domestic monetary policies  the inability to repatriate income or capital  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  regulatory or financial requirements to comply with foreign bureaucratic actions  travel limitations or operational problems caused by public health threats  and changing taxation policies 
diamond offshore is subject to the us treasury department s office of foreign assets control and other us laws and regulations governing its international operations in addition to worldwide anti bribery laws 
in addition  international contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which diamond offshore operates  including laws and regulations relating to the equipping and operation of drilling rigs  import export quotas or other trade barriers  
table of contents repatriation of foreign earnings or capital  oil and gas exploration and development  taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel  and use and compensation of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors 
some foreign governments favor or effectively require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors  require use of a local agent or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
these practices may adversely affect diamond offshore s ability to compete in those regions 
it is difficult to predict what governmental regulations may be enacted in the future that could adversely affect the international drilling industry 
the actions of foreign governments may adversely affect diamond offshore s ability to compete 
as of the date of this report  the greatest concentration of diamond offshore s operating assets outside the united states is in brazil  where it has rigs in its fleet either currently working or contracted to work during in addition  as of the date of this report  diamond offshore has one high specification floater and two jack up rigs contracted offshore egypt 
although these rigs have continued to work throughout the recent political unrest in egypt  there have been  and in the future there may be other  disruptions to the support networks within egypt  including the banking institutions 
diamond offshore s drilling contracts offshore mexico expose it to greater risks than they normally assume 
diamond offshore currently operates and expects to continue to operate rigs drilling offshore mexico for pemex exploracion y produccion pemex  the national oil company of mexico 
the terms of these contracts expose diamond offshore to greater risks than they normally assume  such as exposure to greater environmental liability 
in addition  each contract can be terminated by pemex on days notice  contractually or by statute  subject to certain conditions 
while diamond offshore believes that the financial terms of these contracts and its operating safeguards in place mitigate these risks  diamond offshore can provide no assurance that the increased risk exposure will not have a negative impact on its future operations or financial results 
fluctuations in exchange rates and nonconvertibility of currencies could result in losses 
due to diamond offshore s international operations  diamond offshore may experience currency exchange losses where revenues are received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where it does not effectively hedge an exposure to a foreign currency 
diamond offshore may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation  controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital 
diamond offshore can provide no assurance that financial hedging arrangements will effectively hedge any foreign currency fluctuation losses that may arise 
diamond offshore may be required to accrue additional tax liability on certain of its foreign earnings 
certain of diamond offshore s international rigs are owned and operated  directly or indirectly  by diamond offshore international limited doil  a wholly owned cayman islands subsidiary of diamond offshore 
since forming this subsidiary it has been diamond offshore s intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of this subsidiary to finance foreign operations  except for the earnings of diamond east asia limited  a wholly owned subsidiary of doil 
it is diamond offshore s intention to repatriate the earnings of diamond east asia limited  and us income taxes will be provided on such earnings 
diamond offshore does not expect to provide for us taxes on any future earnings generated by doil  except to the extent that these earnings are immediately subjected to us federal income tax or as they relate to diamond east asia limited 
should a future distribution be made from any unremitted earnings of this subsidiary  diamond offshore may be required to record additional us income taxes 

table of contents rig conversions  upgrades or new builds may be subject to delays and cost overruns 
from time to time  diamond offshore may undertake to add new capacity through conversions or upgrades to existing rigs or through new construction 
projects of this type are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project resulting from numerous factors  including the following shortages of equipment  materials or skilled labor  work stoppages  unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment  unanticipated cost increases  weather interferences  difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions  design and engineering problems  customer acceptance delays  shipyard failures or unavailability  and failure or delay of third party service providers and labor disputes 
failure to complete a rig upgrade or new construction on time  or failure to complete a rig conversion or new construction in accordance with its design specifications may  in some circumstances  result in the delay  renegotiation or cancellation of a drilling contract  resulting in a loss of revenue to diamond offshore 
if a drilling contract is terminated under these circumstances  diamond offshore may not be able to secure a replacement contract with equally favorable terms 
risks related to us and our subsidiary  highmount exploration production llc highmount may not be able to replace reserves and sustain production at current levels 
replacing reserves is risky and uncertain and requires significant capital expenditures 
highmount s success depends largely upon its ability to find  develop or acquire additional reserves that are economically recoverable 
unless highmount replaces the reserves produced through successful development  exploration or acquisition  its proved reserves will decline over time 
highmount may not be able to successfully find and produce reserves economically in the future or to acquire proved reserves at acceptable costs 
highmount makes a substantial amount of capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration and development of reserves 
highmount expects to fund its capital expenditures with cash from its operating activities 
if highmount s cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund its capital expenditure budget  there can be no assurance that financing will be available or available at favorable terms to meet those requirements 
estimates of natural gas and ngl reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise 
estimating the volume of proved natural gas and ngl reserves is a complex process and is not an exact science because of numerous uncertainties inherent in the process 
the process relies on interpretations of available geological  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  such as oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  commodity prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable reserves most likely will vary from highmount s estimates 
any significant variance could 
table of contents materially affect the quantities and present value of highmount s reserves 
in addition  highmount may adjust estimates of proved reserves upward or downward to reflect production history  results of exploration and development drilling  prevailing commodity prices and prevailing development expenses 
the timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and ngl properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the discount factor  used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate representation of their value 
if commodity prices decrease  highmount may be required to take additional write downs of the carrying values of its properties 
highmount may be required  under full cost accounting rules  to write down the carrying value of its natural gas and ngl properties 
a number of factors could result in a write down  including a significant decline in commodity prices  a substantial downward adjustment to estimated proved reserves  a substantial increase in estimated development costs  or deterioration in exploration results 
highmount utilizes the full cost method of accounting for its exploration and development activities 
under full cost accounting  highmount is required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the ceiling test is an impairment test and generally establishes a maximum  or ceiling  of the book value of highmount s natural gas properties that is equal to the expected after tax present value discounted at the required rate of of the future net cash flows from proved reserves  including the effect of cash flow hedges  calculated using the average first day of the month price for the preceding month period 
if the net book value of highmount s exploration and production e p properties reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability exceeds its ceiling limitation  highmount will impair or write down the book value of its e p properties 
a write down may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher natural gas and ngl prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
depending on the magnitude of any future impairment  a ceiling test write down could significantly reduce highmount s income  or produce a loss 
natural gas  ngl and other commodity prices are volatile 
the commodity price highmount receives for its production heavily influences its revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
highmount is subject to risks due to frequent and possibly substantial fluctuations in commodity prices 
ngl prices generally fluctuate on a basis that correlates to fluctuations in crude oil prices 
in the past  the prices of natural gas and crude oil have been extremely volatile  and highmount expects this volatility to continue 
the markets and prices for natural gas and ngls depend upon factors beyond highmount s control 
these factors include  among others  economic and market conditions  domestic production and import levels  storage levels  basis differentials  weather  government regulations and taxation 
lower commodity prices may decrease highmount s revenues and reduce the amount of natural gas and ngls that highmount can produce economically 
highmount engages in commodity price hedging activities 
the extent of highmount s commodity price risk is related to the effectiveness and scope of highmount s hedging activities 
to the extent highmount hedges its commodity price risk  highmount will forego the benefits it would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in its favor 
furthermore  because highmount has entered into derivative transactions related to only a portion of its natural gas and ngl production  highmount will continue to have direct commodity price risk on the unhedged portion 
highmount s actual future production may be significantly higher or lower than highmount estimates at the time it enters into derivative transactions for that period 
as a result  highmount s hedging activities may not be as effective as highmount intends in reducing the volatility of its cash flows  and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of cash flows 
in addition  even though highmount s management monitors its hedging activities  these activities can result in substantial losses 
such losses could occur under various circumstances  including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the applicable hedging arrangement or if the hedging arrangement is imperfect or ineffective 

table of contents risks related to us and our subsidiary  boardwalk pipeline partners  lp boardwalk pipeline may not be able to maintain or replace expiring gas transportation and storage contracts at attractive rates or on a long term basis 
boardwalk pipeline is exposed to market risk when its transportation contracts expire and need to be renewed or replaced 
boardwalk pipeline may not be able to extend contracts with existing customers or obtain replacement contracts at attractive rates or on a long term basis 
key drivers that influence the rates and terms of boardwalk pipeline s transportation contracts include the current and anticipated basis differentials between physical locations on its pipeline systems  which can be affected by  among other things  the availability and supply of natural gas  competition from other pipelines  including pipeline under development  available capacity  storage inventories  regulatory developments  weather and general market demand in the respective areas 
the new sources of natural gas that have been identified throughout the us have created changes in pricing dynamics between supply basins  pooling points and market areas 
as a result of the increase in overall pipeline capacity and the new sources of supply  in basis spreads on boardwalk pipeline s pipeline systems began to narrow 
basis spreads have impacted  and will continue to impact  the rates boardwalk pipeline has been able to negotiate with its customers on contracts due for renewal for firm transportation services  as well as the rates it can charge for interruptible and short term firm transportation services 
the principal elements of competition among pipelines are availability of capacity  rates  terms of service  access to gas supplies  flexibility and reliability of service 
ferc s policies promote competition in natural gas markets by increasing the number of gas transportation options available to boardwalk pipeline s customer base 
increased competition could reduce the volumes of gas transported by boardwalk pipeline s pipeline systems or  in instances where boardwalk pipeline does not have long term contracts with fixed rates  could cause boardwalk pipeline to decrease transportation or storage rates charged to its customers 
competition could intensify the negative impact of factors that could significantly decrease demand for natural gas in the markets served by boardwalk pipeline s operating subsidiaries  such as a recession or adverse economic conditions  weather  higher fuel costs and taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that directly or indirectly increase the cost or limit the use of natural gas 
boardwalk pipeline needs to maintain authority from phmsa to operate portions of its pipeline systems at higher than normal operating pressures 
boardwalk pipeline has entered into firm transportation contracts with shippers which utilize the maximum design capacity of certain of its pipeline assets  assuming that boardwalk pipeline operates those pipelines at higher than normal operating pressures up to smys 
boardwalk pipeline has authority from phmsa to operate those pipeline assets at such higher pressures  however  phmsa retains discretion to withdraw or modify this authority 
if phmsa were to withdraw or materially modify such authority  boardwalk pipeline may not be able to transport all of its contracted quantities of natural gas and could incur significant additional costs to re obtain such authority or to develop alternate ways to meet its contractual obligations 
boardwalk pipeline s natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to ferc s rate making policies which could limit boardwalk pipeline s ability to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines  including earning a reasonable return 
boardwalk pipeline is subject to extensive regulations relating to the rates it can charge for its transportation and storage operations 
for cost based services  ferc establishes both the maximum and minimum rates boardwalk pipeline can charge 
the basic elements that ferc considers are the costs of providing service  the volumes of gas being transported  the rate design  the allocation of costs between services  the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn 
while neither gulf south nor texas gas has an obligation to file a rate case  gulf crossing pipeline has an obligation to file either a rate case or a cost and revenue study by the end of the first quarter of to justify its rates 
customers of boardwalk pipeline s subsidiaries or ferc can challenge the existing rates on any of its pipelines 
during the past two years ferc has challenged the rates of several pipelines not affiliated with boardwalk pipelines 
such a challenge against boardwalk pipeline could adversely affect its ability to establish reasonable transportation rates  to charge rates that would cover future increases in boardwalk pipeline s costs or even to continue to collect rates to maintain its current revenue levels that are designed to permit a reasonable opportunity to recover current costs and depreciation and earn a reasonable return 

table of contents if boardwalk pipeline were to file a rate case or defend its rates in a proceeding commenced by a customer or ferc  boardwalk pipeline would be required  among other things  to establish that the inclusion of an income tax allowance in boardwalk pipeline s cost of service is just and reasonable 
under current ferc policy  since boardwalk pipeline is a limited partnership and does not pay us federal income taxes  this would require boardwalk pipeline to show that its unitholders or their ultimate owners are subject to federal income taxation 
to support such a showing  boardwalk pipeline s general partner may elect to require owners of boardwalk pipeline s units to re certify their status as being subject to us federal income taxation on the income generated by boardwalk pipeline or may attempt to provide other evidence 
boardwalk pipeline can provide no assurance that the evidence it might provide to ferc will be sufficient to establish that its unitholders or their ultimate owners are subject to us federal income tax liability on the income generated by boardwalk pipeline s jurisdictional pipelines 
if boardwalk pipeline is unable to make such a showing  ferc could disallow a substantial portion of the income tax allowance included in the determination of the maximum rates that may be charged by boardwalk pipeline  which could result in a reduction of such maximum rates from current levels 
boardwalk pipeline may not be able to recover all of its costs through existing or future rates 
continued development of new supply sources could impact demand for boardwalk pipeline s services 
supplies of natural gas in production areas that are closer to key end user market areas than boardwalk pipeline s supply sources may compete with gas originating in production areas connected to boardwalk pipeline s system 
for example  the marcellus shale in pennsylvania  new york  west virginia and ohio  may cause gas in supply areas connected to boardwalk pipeline s system to be diverted to markets other than boardwalk pipeline s traditional market areas and may adversely affect capacity utilization on boardwalk pipeline s systems and its ability to renew or replace existing contracts at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows 
in addition  natural gas supplies from the rocky mountains  canada and liquefied natural gas import terminals may compete with and displace volumes from the gulf coast and mid continent supply sources where boardwalk pipeline is located  which could reduce boardwalk pipeline s transportation volumes and the rates it can charge for its services 
boardwalk pipeline is exposed to credit risk relating to nonperformance by its customers 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations 
boardwalk pipeline s exposure generally relates to receivables for services provided  future performance under firm agreements and volumes of gas owed by customers for imbalances or gas loaned by boardwalk pipeline to them under certain no notice and parking and lending services 
ferc gas tariffs only allow boardwalk pipeline to require limited credit support in the event that transportation customers are unable to pay for its services 
if any of boardwalk pipeline s significant customers have credit or financial problems which result in a delay or failure to pay for services provided by boardwalk pipeline or contracted for with boardwalk pipeline  or to repay the gas they owe boardwalk pipeline  it could have a material adverse effect on boardwalk pipeline s business 
in addition  as contracts expire  the failure of any of boardwalk pipeline s customers could also result in the non renewal of contracted capacity 
boardwalk pipeline depends on certain key customers for a significant portion of its revenues 
the loss of any of these key customers could result in a decline in boardwalk pipeline s revenues 
boardwalk pipeline relies on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of revenues 
boardwalk pipeline s largest customer in terms of revenue  devon gas services  lp represented over of boardwalk pipeline s revenues and boardwalk pipeline expects this customer to continue to account for more than of its revenues 
for  boardwalk pipeline s top ten customers comprised approximately of its revenues 
boardwalk pipeline may be unable to negotiate extensions or replacements of contracts with key customers on favorable terms which could materially reduce its contracted transportation volumes and the rates it can charge for its services 
boardwalk pipeline may pursue complex pipeline or storage projects which involve significant risks 
the most significant element of boardwalk pipeline s growth strategy in recent years was the completion of large development projects to enlarge and enhance its pipeline and storage systems 
boardwalk pipeline may undertake additional large development projects in the future as it continues to pursue its growth strategy 
the successful completion of such projects  and the returns boardwalk pipeline may realize from those projects after completion  are subject to many significant risks  including cost overruns  delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  difficult construction conditions  including adverse weather conditions  delays in obtaining key materials  shortages of qualified labor  and 
table of contents escalating costs of labor and materials  particularly in the event there is a high level of construction activity in the pipeline industry at that time 
as a result  boardwalk pipeline may not be able to complete future projects on the expected terms  cost or schedule  or at all 
in addition  boardwalk pipeline cannot be certain that  if completed  it will be able to operate these projects  or that they will perform in accordance with expectations 
other areas of boardwalk pipeline s business may suffer as a result of the diversion of management s attention and other resources from other business concerns 
any of these factors could impair boardwalk pipeline s ability to realize the benefits anticipated from the projects 
significant changes in energy prices could affect natural gas market supply and demand  or potentially reduce the competitiveness of natural gas compared with other forms of energy available to boardwalk pipeline s customers  which could reduce system throughput and adversely affect boardwalk pipeline s revenues and available cash 
due to the natural decline in traditional gas production connected to boardwalk pipeline s system  boardwalk pipeline s success depends on its ability to obtain access to new sources of natural gas  which is dependent on factors beyond its control including the price level of natural gas 
in general terms  the price of natural gas fluctuates in response to changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors  including economic conditions  weather conditions  seasonal trends and hurricane disruptions  new supply sources  the availability of adequate transportation capacity  storage inventory levels  the price and availability of other forms of energy  the effect of energy conservation measures  the nature and extent of  and changes in  governmental regulation  for example greenhouse gas legislation and taxation  and the anticipated future prices of natural gas and other commodities 
it is difficult to predict future changes in gas prices 
however  the abundance of natural gas supply discoveries over the last few years would generally indicate a bias toward downward pressure on prices 
downward movement in gas prices could negatively impact producers in nontraditional supply areas such as the barnett shale  the bossier sands  the caney woodford shale  the fayetteville shale and the haynesville shale  including producers who have contracted for capacity with boardwalk pipeline 
significant financial difficulties experienced by boardwalk pipeline s producer customers could impact their ability to pay for services rendered or otherwise reduce their demand for boardwalk pipeline s services 
high natural gas prices may result in a reduction in the demand for natural gas 
a reduced level of demand for natural gas could reduce the utilization of capacity on boardwalk pipeline s systems  reduce the demand for boardwalk pipeline s services and could result in the non renewal of contracted capacity as contracts expire 
risks related to us and our subsidiaries generally in addition to the specific risks and uncertainties faced by our subsidiaries  as discussed above  we and all of our subsidiaries face risks and uncertainties related to  among other things  terrorism  hurricanes and other natural disasters  competition  government regulation  dependence on key executives and employees  litigation  dependence on information technology and compliance with environmental laws 

table of contents acts of terrorism could harm us and our subsidiaries 
future terrorist attacks and the continued threat of terrorism in this country or abroad  as well as possible retaliatory military and other action by the united states and its allies  could have a significant impact on the assets and businesses of certain of our subsidiaries 
cna issues coverages that are exposed to risk of loss from a terrorism act 
terrorist acts or the threat of terrorism  including increased political  economic and financial market instability and volatility in the price of oil and gas  could affect the market for diamond offshore s drilling services  boardwalk pipeline s transportation  gathering and storage services and highmount s exploration and production activities 
in addition  future terrorist attacks could lead to reductions in business travel and tourism which could harm loews hotels 
while our subsidiaries take steps that they believe are appropriate to secure their assets  there is no assurance that they can completely secure them against a terrorist attack or obtain adequate insurance coverage for terrorist acts at reasonable rates 
our subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal  state and local governmental regulations 
the businesses operated by our subsidiaries are impacted by current and potential federal  state and local governmental regulations which impose or might impose a variety of restrictions and compliance obligations on those companies 
governmental regulations can also change materially in ways that could adversely affect those companies 
risks faced by our subsidiaries related to governmental regulation include the following cna 
the insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout the united states 
most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of cna s policyholders rather than its investors 
each state in which cna does business has established supervisory agencies that regulate its business  including standards of solvency  including risk based capital measurements  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of investments  restrictions on cna s ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance or unprofitable market areas  the required use of certain methods of accounting and reporting  the establishment of reserves for unearned premiums  losses and other purposes  potential assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired  insolvent or failed private or quasi governmental insurers  licensing of insurers and agents  approval of policy forms  limitations on the ability of cna s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us  and limitations on the ability to non renew  cancel or change terms and conditions in policies 
regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
cna also is required by the states to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers 
each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks 
cna s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and is generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state 
diamond offshore 
the drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas exploration industry and  accordingly  is affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the energy business generally 
diamond offshore may be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations 
it is also possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to diamond offshore s operating costs or may significantly limit drilling activity 

table of contents governments in some countries are increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions  the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries 
the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and gas for economic  environmental or other reasons could materially and adversely affect diamond offshore s operations by limiting drilling opportunities 
highmount 
all of highmount s operations are conducted onshore in the united states 
the us oil and gas industry  and highmount s operations  are subject to regulation at the federal  state and local level 
such regulation includes requirements with respect to  among other things permits to drill and to conduct other operations  provision of financial assurances such as bonds covering drilling and well operations  the location of wells  the method of drilling and completing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells  the marketing  transportation and reporting of production  the valuation and payment of royalties  the size of drilling and spacing units regarding the density of wells which may be drilled in a particular area  the unitization or pooling of natural gas and oil properties  maximum rates of production from natural gas and oil wells  venting or flaring of natural gas and the ratability of production 
the conference committee report for the department of the interior  environment  and related agencies appropriations act for fiscal year requested the epa to conduct a study of hydraulic fracturing  particularly the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water 
hydraulic fracturing is a technique commonly used by oil and gas exploration companies  including highmount  to stimulate the production of oil and natural gas by injecting fluids and sand into underground wells at high pressures  causing fractures or fissures in the geological formation which allow oil and gas to flow more freely 
in recent years  concerns have been raised that the fracturing process may contaminate underground sources of drinking water 
several bills were introduced in the th congress seeking federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing  which has historically been regulated at the state level  though none of the proposed legislation was passed into law 
indications are that similar bills will be introduced in the new congress 
if hydraulic fracturing is banned or significantly restricted by federal regulation or otherwise  it could impair highmount s ability to economically drill new natural gas wells  which would reduce its production  revenues and profitability 
boardwalk pipeline 
boardwalk pipeline s natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation by ferc and the dot among other federal and state authorities 
in addition to ferc rules and regulations related to the rates boardwalk pipeline can charge for its services  federal regulations extend to pipeline safety  operating terms and conditions of service  the types of services boardwalk pipeline may offer  construction or abandonment of facilities  accounting and record keeping  and relationships and transactions with affiliated companies 
these regulations can adversely impact boardwalk pipeline s ability to compete for business  construct new facilities  including by increasing the lead times to develop projects  offer new services  or recover the full cost of operating its pipelines 
our subsidiaries face significant risks related to compliance with environmental laws 
our subsidiaries have extensive obligations and or financial exposure related to compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws  many of which have become increasingly stringent in recent years and may in some cases impose strict liability  which could be substantial  rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person 
for example  diamond offshore could be liable for damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills related to its operations  including for conduct of or conditions caused by others 
highmount is also subject to extensive environmental regulation in the conduct of its business  particularly related to the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products  water and air pollution control procedures  and the remediation of petroleum product contamination 
we are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change 
as awareness of climate change issues increases  governments around the world are beginning to address the matter 
this may result in new environmental regulations that may unfavorably impact us  our subsidiaries and their suppliers and customers 
we and our subsidiaries may be exposed to risks related to new laws or regulations pertaining to climate change  carbon emissions or energy use that could decrease the use of oil or natural gas  thus reducing demand for hydrocarbon based fuel and related services provided by our energy subsidiaries 
governments also may pass laws or regulations encouraging or mandating the use of alternative energy sources  such as wind power and solar energy  which 
table of contents may reduce demand for oil and natural gas 
in addition  changing global weather patterns have been associated with extreme weather events and could change longer term natural catastrophe trends  including increasing the frequency and severity of hurricanes and other natural disasters which could increase future catastrophe losses at cna and damage to property  disruption of business and higher operating costs at diamond offshore  boardwalk pipeline  highmount and loews hotels 
there is currently no federal regulation that limits ghg emissions in the us however  several bills were introduced in congress in recent years that would regulate us ghg emissions under a cap and trade system 
although these bills were not passed into law  some regulation of that type may be enacted in the us in the near future 
in addition  in  the epa adopted regulations under the clean air act requiring the monitoring and reporting of annual ghg emissions by operators of facilities that emit more than  metric tons of ghg per year  which includes boardwalk pipeline and highmount 
numerous states and several regional multi state climate initiatives have announced or adopted plans to regulate ghg emissions  though the state programs vary widely 
the establishment of a ghg reporting system and registry may be a first step toward broader regulation of ghg emissions

we could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of the long lived assets and goodwill of our subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries regularly evaluate their long lived assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
most notably  we could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of offshore drilling equipment at diamond offshore  natural gas and oil properties at highmount  pipeline equipment at boardwalk pipeline and hotel properties owned by loews hotels 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists 
the goodwill impairment test requires us to identify reporting units and estimate each unit s fair value as of the testing date 
we calculate the fair value of our reporting units each of our principal operating subsidiaries based on estimates of future discounted cash flows  which reflect management s judgments and assumptions regarding the appropriate risk adjusted discount rate  future industry conditions and operations and other factors 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets which could impact the need to record an impairment charge and the amount of any charge taken 
we are a holding company and derive substantially all of our income and cash flow from our subsidiaries

claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and our creditors and shareholders 
we could have liability in the future for tobacco related lawsuits 
as a result of our ownership of lorillard  inc lorillard prior to the separation of lorillard from us in the separation  from time to time we have been named as a defendant in tobacco related lawsuits 
we are currently a defendant in three such lawsuits and could be named as a defendant in additional tobacco related suits  notwithstanding the completion of the separation

table of contents management s report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules a f and d f for us 
our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 
there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any control system  however well designed  including the possibility of human error and the possible circumvention or overriding of controls 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
management must make judgments with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of any specific control measure 
the design of a control system also is based in part upon assumptions and judgments made by management about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that a control will be effective under all potential future conditions 
as a result  even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting can provide no more than reasonable assurance with respect to the fair presentation of financial statements and the processes under which they were prepared 
our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  in making this assessment  management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control integrated framework 
based on this assessment  our management believes that  as of december   our internal control over financial reporting was effective 
our independent registered public accounting firm  deloitte touche llp  has issued an audit report on the company s internal control over financial reporting

we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 
a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by  or under the supervision of  the company s principal executive and principal financial officers  or persons performing similar functions  and effected by the company s board of directors  management  and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use  or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting  including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls  material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
also  projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
in our opinion  the company maintained  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission
