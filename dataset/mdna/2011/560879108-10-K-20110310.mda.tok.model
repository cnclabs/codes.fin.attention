item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an emerging medical device company that markets our advanced robotic arm solution and orthopedic implants for orthopedic procedures 
we offer makoplasty  an innovative  restorative surgical solution that enables orthopedic surgeons to consistently  reproducibly and precisely treat patient specific osteoarthritic disease 
in february  our common stock began trading on the nasdaq global market under the ticker symbol mako in connection with the closing of our initial public offering 
we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses as we increase our sales and marketing activities and otherwise continue to invest capital in the development and expansion of our products and our business generally 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase to support the sales and marketing efforts associated with the growing commercialization of makoplasty and to support our continued growth in operations 
we also expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to expand our research and development activities  including the support of existing products and the research of potential future products  including our hip makoplasty application and associated implant systems 
recent key milestones in the development of our business include the following during the year ended december   we sold rio systems  including two to international distributors  increasing our commercial installed base to rio systems 
during the year ended december   a total of  makoplasty procedures were performed  representing a increase over the same period in in february  we received k marketing clearance from the fda for our hip makoplasty application  which assists a surgeon in performing all components of a total hip arthroplasty using the rio system 
we believe this represents achievement of a necessary milestone towards what we anticipate will be our continuing development and future commercialization of a hip makoplasty application 
the rio system and our classic restoris onlay unicompartmental knee implant system were approved for european union ce marking in december and january  respectively  which is a legal requirement for medical devices intended for sale in europe 
our restoris mck onlay unicompartmental implant system was approved for ce marking in april and our restoris mck onlay patellofemoral and bicompartmental implant systems were approved for ce marking in january during the second quarter of  we launched a clinical research study in partnership with glasgow royal infirmary  strathclyde university and national health services in glasgow  scotland 
in connection with the clinical research study  we placed a rio system at the glasgow royal infirmary 
the system is being utilized in a three year randomized prospective clinical trial with the objective of demonstrating the clinical  functional and ultimately  economic benefits of knee makoplasty 
glasgow royal infirmary reported that procedures were performed at its site during the year ended december in october  the first hip makoplasty procedure was completed as part of our surgeon preference evaluation process  designed to solicit user feedback in advance of mako s full commercial release of our hip makoplasty application  currently expected in the second half of as of december   hip makoplasty procedures were performed as part of our surgeon preference evaluation process 

table of contents we believe that the keys to growing our business are expanding the acceptance and application of knee makoplasty to unicompartmental and multicompartmental knee resurfacing procedures and introducing other potential future applications  including the hip makoplasty application and associated implant systems 
to successfully commercialize our products and grow our business  we must gain market acceptance for makoplasty procedures 
factors that may influence future results of operations the following is a description of factors that may influence our future results of operations  including significant trends and challenges that we believe are important to an understanding of our business and results of operations 
revenue revenue is generated from unit sales of our rio system  including associated instrumentation  installation services and training  sales of implants and disposable products  and sales of warranty and maintenance services 
future revenue from sales of our products is difficult to predict and we expect that it will only modestly reduce our continuing and increasing losses resulting from selling  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses and other activities for at least the next two or three years 
our future revenue may also be adversely affected by the current general economic downturn and the resulting tightening of the credit markets  which may cause purchasing decisions to be delayed or cause our customers to experience difficulties in securing adequate funding to buy our products 
the generation of recurring revenue through sales of our implants  disposable products and warranty service contracts is an important part of the makoplasty business model 
we anticipate that recurring revenue will constitute an increasing percentage of our total revenue as we leverage each new installation of our rio system to generate recurring sales of implants and disposable products and as we expand our implant product offering 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that we had incorrectly recognized revenue and expenses associated with the initial warranty obligation and maintenance services included in all previous rio system sales 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an adjustment to decrease revenue by million  to reverse the accrual for our warranty and maintenance obligation by  and to increase net loss by  or per basic and diluted share 
the adjustment arose over the quarters throughout and and did not materially affect our trend in earnings 
as the adjustment was related to the correction of an error  we performed the analysis required by staff accounting bulletin  materiality  and staff accounting bulletin  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
based on this analysis  we concluded that the effect of the error was not material to the quarters and years in the two year period ended december  from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective 
cost of revenue cost of revenue primarily consists of the direct costs associated with the manufacture of rio systems  implants and disposable products for which revenue has been recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
costs associated with providing services are expensed as incurred 
cost of revenue also includes the allocation of manufacturing overhead costs  royalties related to the sale of products covered by licensing arrangements and write offs of obsolete  impaired or excess inventory 
for the year ended december   we wrote off million  or per basic and diluted share  of excess restoris unicompartmental knee implant system  or restoris classic  implants and related instrumentation 
excess implants of million was charged to cost of revenue procedures  cancellation 
table of contents charges of  was charged to cost of revenue service and other and excess instrumentation of million was charged to selling  general and administrative expenses 
these charges were necessitated by the rapid adoption of the restoris mck multicompartmental knee implant system  or restoris mck  and the corresponding decline in the usage of restoris classic 
restoris classic was introduced in the third quarter of and was modeled after existing well known unicompartmental designs 
in connection with the launch of the rio system  in the second quarter of  we launched our next generation restoris mck which was designed as a premium addition to the restoris product family with the goal of delivering a more natural feeling knee by preserving bone and providing anatomical features such as high flexion 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  including stock based compensation and benefits  for sales  marketing  clinical research  operations  regulatory  quality  executive  finance  legal and administrative personnel 
other significant expenses include costs associated with sales and marketing activities  marketing and advertising materials  insurance  professional fees for legal and accounting services  consulting fees  travel expenses  facility and related operating costs  and recruiting expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase due to the planned increase in the number of employees necessary to support the sales and marketing efforts associated with the growing commercialization of makoplasty and an increased number of employees necessary to support our continued growth in operations 
in addition  we expect to incur additional costs associated with securing and protecting our intellectual property rights as necessary to support our future product offerings 
research and development expenses costs related to research  design and development of products are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
these costs include direct salary and benefit costs for research and development employees including stock based compensation  cost for materials used in research and development activities and costs for outside services 
we expect our research and development expense to increase as we continue to expand our research and development activities  including the support of existing products and the research and development of potential future products  including our hip makoplasty application and associated implant systems 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods 
the accounting estimates that require our most significant  difficult and subjective judgments include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets  impairment of long lived assets and the determination of stock based compensation 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in
