critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our revenues  income or loss from operations and net income or loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to an understanding of our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses and significant estimates and judgments applied by management 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include stock option accounting  accounting for income taxes  and valuation and evaluating impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value over the requisite service period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options award on the date of grant 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as by management assumptions regarding a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and the expected life of the award  which is based in part upon actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the expected terms of the options and employee stock purchase plan rights are based on evaluations of historical and expected future employee exercise behavior 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury rates at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected life at grant date 
volatility is based on historical and expected future volatility of the company s stock 
the company has not historically issued any dividends and does not expect to in the future 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of the grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimates 
if factors change  we may employ different assumptions in the calculation of compensation expense and the compensation expense recorded for future periods may differ significantly from the expense recorded in the current period 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  under which deferred income taxes are recognized based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate  estimates of future taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
if tax regulations  operating results  or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the recorded valuation allowance is based on significant estimates and judgments and if the facts and circumstances change the valuation allowance could materially change 
in accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
as of september   the company had us federal and state net operating loss nol carry forwards of approximately  and  respectively  which expire in fiscal years through if not utilized 
in fiscal year  the company completed an internal revenue code section analysis of the loss carry forwards and determined that all of the company s loss carry forwards were utilizable and not restricted under section the company has not updated its section analysis subsequent to and does not believe there have been any events subsequent to that would impact the analysis 
we recorded an income tax benefit of  for the year ended september   compared to income tax expense of  for the year ended september  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company reversed a portion of its valuation allowance in consideration of all available positive and negative evidence  including our historical operating results  current financial condition  and potential future taxable income 
the reduction in the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year resulted in a non cash income tax benefit of approximately million 
as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that these deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not or unknown  we must establish a valuation allowance 
our future potential taxable income was evaluated based primarily on anticipated operating results for fiscal years through we determined that projecting operating results beyond involves substantial uncertainty and we discounted forecasts beyond as a basis to support our deferred tax assets 
based upon the assessment of all available evidence  the company released  of additional valuation allowance for the year ended september  which was recorded as a one time income tax benefit 
as of september   the company has a remaining valuation allowance of approximately million  of which million is short term and million is long term  against its remaining deferred tax assets 
the company will continue to assess the assumptions used to determine the amount of our valuation allowance and may adjust the valuation allowance in future periods based on changes in assumptions of estimated future income and other factors 
if the valuation allowance is reduced  we would record an income tax benefit in the period the valuation allowance is reduced 
if the valuation allowance is increased  we would record additional income tax expense 
the company files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  and various state jurisdictions 
based on its evaluation  the company has concluded that it has no significant unrecognized tax benefits 
with limited exceptions  the company is no longer subject to us federal and state income tax examinations for fiscal years ending prior to in the company changed its fiscal year to september impairment of long lived assets and goodwill the company s long lived assets at september  consisted of property  plant and equipment  patents and goodwill 
the company reviews the carrying amount of its property  plant and equipment and patents if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
when this review indicates the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets  the company recognizes an asset impairment charge against operations for the amount by which the carrying amount of the impaired asset exceeds its fair value 
determining fair values of property  plant and equipment and patents using a discounted cash flow method involves significant judgment and requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions  including long term projections of cash flows  market conditions and appropriate discount rates 
judgments are based on historical experience  current market trends  consultations with external valuation specialists and other information 
if facts and circumstances change  the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in a materially different outcome 
the company generally develops these forecasts based on recent sales data for existing products  planned timing of new product launches  and estimated expansion of the fttp market 
the company reviews the carrying amount of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company measures the possible goodwill impairment loss based on an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any previously unrecognized intangible assets 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
this test for the period ended september  resulted in no change to goodwill from the prior period 
an impairment loss would be based on significant estimates and judgments and if the facts and circumstances change a potential impairment could have a material impact 
no impairment of long lived assets or goodwill has occurred during the years ended september  or  respectively 
results of operations year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues for the fiscal year increased to  from revenue of  in revenue growth was experienced from existing clients as well as from the development of new accounts 
the company experienced gains from independent telephone companies who operate within a community or regional location as well as an emerging presence among those carriers with a broader or national footprint 
in addition to its direct sales efforts  the company achieved increasing revenues from a broad range of emerging sales channels  including revenues derived from distributor arrangements and from private label agreements 
these gains were throughout the product line  with the most significant increase within optical component technologies 
the increase in revenues described above was due to a strengthening economic environment and in addition the revenues were positively affected by early stage deployments associated with the american recovery and reinvestment act 
as a result of the above factors  revenues in fiscal year to commercial data networks and broadband service providers were of sales  or  while revenues associated with contract manufacturing for original equipment manufacturers outside of the telecommunications market were of sales  or  for fiscal for fiscal year  revenues to commercial data networks and broadband service providers were of sales  or  while revenues associated with contract manufacturing for original equipment manufacturers outside of the telecommunications market were of sales  or  cost of sales for the fiscal year was  an increase of  or from the  in fiscal year gross margin improved to in fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year gross profit increased  or  from  for fiscal year to  for fiscal year the year over year gain is the result of enhanced collaboration with our global suppliers resulting in lower purchased product costs  product mix that favors clearfield value added features and continual improvements in our manufacturing processes  which together have resulted in greater manufacturing efficiency and absorption of factory overhead associated with the higher production volumes 
selling  general and administrative expense increased  or  from  for fiscal year to  for fiscal year compensation expenses associated with the achievement of revenue and operating income objectives increased  in fiscal year over fiscal year sales and marketing expenses increased  in fiscal year over fiscal year this increase was due mainly to additional head count and the associated travel expenses with those activities  as well as higher market development expenses 
stock based compensation increased  due mainly to expense related to new grants of stock options to company employees in the fourth quarter of fiscal year offsetting these increases was a decrease in depreciation of  for fiscal year  mainly as a result of a portion of our assets reaching their fully depreciated lives 
income from operations for fiscal year was  compared to  for fiscal year this increase is due to the increase in revenue  improved margins  and controlled expenses 
interest income in fiscal year was  compared to  for the fiscal year the decrease is a result of declining interest rates resulting in lower returns on our investments 
the company invests its excess cash primarily in fdic backed bank certificates of deposit and money market accounts 
we expect interest income may decline as interest rates continue to fall 
other income decreased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year this is attributable to rental income for both years from our aberdeen  sd facility which was sold in june at which time the rental arrangement ended 
income tax benefit for fiscal year was  reflecting recognition of a reversal of a portion of the deferred tax asset dta valuation allowance 
the reversal of a portion of the dta valuation allowance was  and was offset by tax amortization of goodwill of  which is deferred  federal alternative minimum tax of  and various state taxes in the amount of  income tax expense for was  consisting of tax amortization of goodwill of  alternative minimum tax of approximately  and various state taxes in the amount of  net income for fiscal year was  or per share for basic and for diluted compared to  or per basic and per diluted share for the year the increase in net income was primarily due to our increased strategic investment of sales and marketing programs  continued product acceptance that drove increased revenue  and the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   our principal source of liquidity was our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
those sources total  at september   compared to  at september  our excess cash is invested mainly in certificates of deposit backed by the fdic and money market accounts 
investments considered long term are  at september   compared to  at september  combined balances of short term cash and investments and long term investments total  at september  as compared to  at september  we have no long term debt obligations at september  or  respectively 
operating activities net cash generated from operations for the fiscal year ended september  totaled  cash provided by operations included net income of  which included non cash expenses for depreciation of  and stock based compensation of  along with gains on disposals of assets of  mainly related to the sale of the aberdeen  sd facility 
changes in working capital items included an increase in accounts receivable of  reflecting a lower number of days outstanding due to early payment terms with several customers 
inventory increased  due to higher stocking levels required to meet increased demand 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased  included within this amount are employee compensation accruals increasing by  mainly due to incentive payments related to fiscal  and an accounts payable increase of net cash generated from operations for the fiscal year ended september  totaled  this was primarily due to our net income of  depreciation of  and stock based compensation of  this was offset by an increase in accounts receivable of  an increase in inventory of  and a reduction in accounts payable of  investing activities for the fiscal year ended september   we used  in cash for the purchase of equipment 
included in this amount were purchases for manufacturing equipment in the amount of  and it equipment and software purchases of  during the same period we purchased  of fdic backed certificates of deposit and sold approximately  of fdic backed certificates of deposit 
in fiscal year we received proceeds from the sale of assets in the amount of  the majority of these proceeds were from the sale of the aberdeen facility which accounted for approximately  of the proceeds 
the result is a net increase in cash from investing activities of  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the company intends to continue to invest in the necessary and appropriate manufacturing equipment to help maintain a competitive position in manufacturing capability but has no material commitments for capital expenditures for fiscal year for the fiscal year ended september   we purchased  of manufacturing and it equipment and software 
during the same period we purchased  of fdic backed certificates of deposit and sold approximately  of fdic backed certificates of deposit 
in addition we received proceeds of  from the payoff of the note from an entity controlled by anil jain 
the result is a net decrease in cash from investing activities of  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year financing activities for the fiscal year ended september  we received  from employees participation and purchase of stock through our employee stock purchase plan espp   from the issuance of stock as a result of employees and directors exercising stock options and  from excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options 
the net cash received from financing activities was  for the fiscal year ended september   we used  to make scheduled debt principal payments principally associated with the financing of our it systems 
we received  from the issuance of stock from the exercise of employee stock options 
the net cash received from financing activities totaled  the company has current cash and cash equivalents and investments with a maturity of less than one year that total  which we believe provides a strong financial position and along with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital and investment requirements for the next months 
the company intends on utilizing its available cash and assets primarily for its continued organic growth  as well as potential future strategic transactions 
however  future growth  organically or through acquisition  may require the company to raise capital through additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that any such financing would be available on commercially acceptable terms
