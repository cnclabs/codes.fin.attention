application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company s accounting policies that affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
management has discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the board of directors and its audit committee 
revenue recognition revenues consist of product and service revenues and are recognized in accordance with asc topic  revenue recognition 
product revenues are recognized upon shipment  provided fees are fixed and determinable  a customer purchase order is obtained when applicable  and collection is probable 
sales tax collected from customers and remitted to the applicable taxing authorities is accounted for on a net basis  with no impact to revenues 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
deferred revenue consists primarily of service revenue not yet performed 
our fixed price contracts relate primarily to long term engineering design services projects 
the revenues for such projects that require significant customization and integration are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
in using the percentage of completion method  revenues are generally recorded based on the percentage of effort incurred to date on a contract relative to the estimated total expected contract effort 
significant judgment is required when estimating total contract effort and progress to completion on the arrangements as well as whether a loss is expected to be incurred on the contract 
management uses historical experience  project plans and an assessment of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the arrangement to establish these estimates 
uncertainties include implementation delays or performance issues that may or may not be within our control 
changes in these estimates could result in a material impact on revenues and net earnings loss 
if we are unable to develop reasonably dependable costs or revenue estimates  the completed contract method is applied under which all revenues and related costs are deferred until the contract is completed 
warranty reserve the company offers to its customers a limited warranty that its products will be free from defect in the materials and workmanship for a specified period 
the company has established a warranty reserve  as a component of accrued liabilities  for any potential claims 
the company estimates its warranty reserve based upon an analysis of all identified or expected claims and an estimate of the cost to resolve those claims 
changes in claim rates and differences between actual and expected warranty costs could impact the warranty reserve estimates 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the company records accounts receivable at their net realizable value and management is required to estimate the collectability of the company s trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
management evaluates all accounts periodically and a reserve is established based on the best facts available to management 
this reserve is also partially determined by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories based on historical results and is reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowance for returns the company estimates its allowance for returns based upon expected return rates 
the estimates of expected return rates are generally a factor of historical returns 
changes in return rates could impact allowance for return estimates 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market involves an inherent level of risk and uncertainty due to technology trends in the industry and customer demand for our products 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  management is required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
reserve requirements generally increase as projected demand decreases due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes as well as longer than previously expected usage periods 
the company has experienced significant changes in required reserves in the past due to changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuances of product lines as well as declining market conditions 
it is possible that significant changes in this estimate may occur in the future as market conditions change 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation under the provisions of asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
management estimates are necessary in determining compensation expense for both restricted stock and stock options with performance based vesting criteria 
compensation expense for this type of stock based award is recognized over the period from the date the performance condition is determined to be probable of occurring through the date the applicable condition is expected to be met 
if the performance condition is not considered probable of being achieved  no expense is recognized until such time as the performance condition is considered probable of being met  if ever 
management evaluates whether performance conditions are probable of occurring on a quarterly basis 
income taxes the company determines its deferred taxes using the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax law 
the company s consolidated financial statements include deferred income taxes arising from the recognition of revenues and expenses in different periods for income tax and financial reporting purposes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realizable 
the company considers recent historical losses  future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
management continuously assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets 
the company recognizes the impact of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return in the financial statements at the amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more likely than not of being sustained 
the company is periodically engaged in various tax audits by federal  state and foreign governmental authorities incidental to its business activities 
the company records reserves for its estimated probable losses of these proceedings  if applicable

many of these telecom equipment manufacturers continued to experience a shift in their customer demand and continued to lose market share to asian equipment providers located within the asian markets throughout several of these market leaders who experienced a decline in revenues over the past few years are customers of interphase  and as such  their demand for interphase products and services continued to decline during this was reflected in our financial results for interphase has responded to this global impact to the telecom market  and in  we launched a multi tiered strategy to diversify our product and service offerings into a number of new business areas  both within and outside of the telecommunications market in which we have traditionally operated over the past decade 
some of these new market opportunities include electronic manufacturing services  cloud computing  lte baseband products and embedded computer vision 
our goal in the above mentioned strategy is to diversify our product and service offerings and enter robust new market segments that will allow us to generate growth in a variety of ways 
we have continued to diligently manage our expenses and investments and look for efficiencies throughout our company in an effort to negate the impacts from our decline in revenue during as a result  we implemented a company wide restructuring plan in the second half of the year  which is expected to result in savings of approximately million in annualized operating costs 
these efforts were taken in order to bring our expenses in line with our recent revenue run rate 
we believe that the diversification work as well as the cost reduction measures will allow us to expand our revenue base as well as our ability to compete effectively in new markets in the future 
results of operations revenues total revenues for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively

these income tax benefits were primarily due to a research and development tax credit earned by our operations in france

our significant long term obligations are operating leases on facilities and future debt payments 
we have not paid any dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the following table summarizes our future contractual obligations and payment commitments as of december  in thousands contractual obligation payments due by period total years long term debt obligation  operating lease obligations  total at december   we had borrowings of million under a million revolving credit facility with a bank 
the revolving credit facility matures on december  and is secured throughout the term of the credit facility by marketable securities 
we incur interest expense on the borrowings from the revolving credit facility at a rate of libor plus to applicable margin rate based on certain factors included in our credit agreement 
at december   our interest rate on the borrowings from the revolving credit facility was 
we used the rate to estimate interest expense for through december the interest expense estimate is  annually for the years through december we lease our facilities under non cancelable operating leases with the longest terms extending to march our operating lease at our headquarters location includes a  letter of credit issued to our landlord which can only be used in the case of non payment of such lease 
the letter of credit  if accessed  would be funded by our existing revolving credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements in an attempt to mitigate foreign currency risk  we have entered into  from time to time  foreign exchange contracts to purchase a fixed amount of euros on a fixed date in the future at a fixed rate determined at the contract date 
at december  and  we had no foreign exchange contracts outstanding 
other management believes that cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility  together with cash on hand  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for working capital  capital expenditures and debt service 
to the extent that our actual operating results or other developments differ from our expectations  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
we periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and available resources in view of  among other things  our capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  we have in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital  refinance or restructure indebtedness  issue additional securities  repurchase shares of our common stock or take a combination of such steps to manage our liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  we may review opportunities for acquisitions  joint ventures or other business combinations 
in the event of any such transaction  we may consider using available cash  issuing additional equity securities or increasing the indebtedness of the company or its subsidiaries 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  to amend certain guidance in fasb asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
the amended guidance in asc modifies the separation criteria by eliminating the criterion that requires objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items and eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation 
instead  the amended guidance requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables based on their relative selling price 
the amended guidance in asc is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early application and retrospective application permitted 
we elected early application of asc and it was effective for us on january  our adoption of this standard did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  that reduces the types of transactions that fall within the current scope of software revenue recognition guidance 
existing software revenue recognition guidance requires that its provisions be applied to an entire arrangement when the sale of any products or services containing or utilizing software is considered more than incidental to the product or service 
as a result of the amendments included in asu no 
 many tangible products and services that rely on software will be accounted for under the multiple element arrangements revenue recognition guidance rather than under the software revenue recognition guidance 
under the asu  the following components would be excluded from the scope of software revenue recognition guidance the tangible element of the product  software products bundled with tangible products where the software components and non software components function together to deliver the product s essential functionality  and undelivered components that relate to software that is essential to the tangible product s functionality 
the asu also provides guidance on how to allocate transaction consideration when an arrangement contains both deliverables within the scope of software revenue guidance software deliverables and deliverables not within the scope of that guidance non software deliverables 
we expect to adopt and prospectively apply the provisions of this standard beginning january  our adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because we conduct business on a global basis and  in some cases  in foreign currencies 
the company s operations in france were transacted in the local currency and converted into us dollars based on published exchange rates for the periods reported and were therefore subject to risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
the euro to us dollar translation accounted for charges of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this risk will be significantly reduced in the future due to the closure of our french operations at the end of in an attempt to mitigate the risk described above  we have entered into  from time to time  foreign exchange contracts to purchase a fixed amount of euros on a fixed date in the future at a fixed rate determined at the contract date 
these derivative financial instruments do not meet the criteria to qualify as hedges under asc topic  derivatives and hedging  and therefore any change in the market value of these contracts resulting in a gain or loss is recognized as other loss income  net in the period of the change 
for the year ended december   we recognized a loss of approximately  related to a foreign exchange contract 
we held no foreign exchange contracts at any point during the year ended december   and thus there was no related gain or loss 
for the year ended december   we recognized a gain of  related to these foreign exchange contracts 
at december  and  there were no foreign exchange contracts outstanding 
market price risk we had no equity hedge contracts outstanding as of december   or interest rate risk our investments are subject to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected due to movements in interest rates 
we invest our cash in a variety of interest earning financial instruments  including bank time deposits  money market funds  and variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations and national governmental entities and agencies 
due to the demand nature of our money market funds and the short term nature of our time deposits and debt securities portfolio  these assets are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we manage this risk through investments with shorter term maturities and varying maturity dates 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate decrease of less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  this potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our marketable securities at december  actual results may differ materially 
the same hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate decrease of less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  we maintain a million revolving bank credit facility maturing december  with an applicable interest rate on any outstanding balances under the credit facility based on london interbank offered rate libor plus to applicable margin rate based on certain factors included in our credit agreement 
the interest rate on the borrowings under the revolving credit facility was and at december  and  respectively 
the unused portion of the credit facility is subject to an unused facility fee ranging from 
to 
depending on total deposits with the creditor 
a hypothetical basis point increase in libor would increase annual interest expense on this credit facility by approximately  all borrowings under this facility are secured by marketable securities
