item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview royal gold  together with its subsidiaries  is engaged in the business of acquiring and managing precious metals royalties and similar interests 
royalties are passive non operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to revenue or production from the project after deducting specified costs  if any 
we seek to acquire existing royalties or to finance projects that are in production or in development stage in exchange for royalties or similar interests 
we are engaged in a continual review of opportunities to acquire existing royalties  to create new royalties or similar interests through the financing of mine development or exploration  or to acquire companies that hold royalties or similar interests 
we currently  and generally at any time  have acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review  including  for example  our engagement of consultants and advisors to analyze particular opportunities  analysis of technical  financial and other confidential information  submission of indications of interest  participation in preliminary discussions and involvement as a bidder in competitive auctions 

table of contents as of june   the company owns royalties on producing properties  development stage properties and exploration stage properties  of which the company considers to be evaluation stage projects 
the company uses evaluation stage to describe exploration stage properties that contain mineralized material and on which operators are engaged in the search for reserves 
we do not conduct mining operations nor are we required to contribute to capital costs except as contractually obligated to as part of the mt

during the fiscal year ended june   we focused on the management of our existing royalty interests and the acquisition of royalty and similar interests 
our financial results are primarily tied to the price of gold  silver  copper  nickel and other metals  as well as production from our producing stage royalty interests 
the price of gold  silver  copper  nickel and other metals have fluctuated in recent years 
the marketability and the price of gold  silver  copper  nickel and other metals are influenced by numerous factors beyond the control of the company and may have a material and adverse effect on the company results of operations and financial condition 
for the fiscal years ended june   and  gold  silver  copper and nickel price averages and percentage of royalty revenues by metal were as follows fiscal year ended june  june  june  metal average price percentage of royalty revenue average price percentage of royalty revenue average price percentage of royalty revenue gold ounce silver ounce copper pound nickel pound other n a n a n a operators production estimates by royalty for calendar year we received annual production estimates from many of the operators of our producing mines during the first calendar quarter of the following table shows such production estimates for our principal producing properties for calendar as well as the actual production reported to us by the various operators through june  the estimates and production reports are prepared by the operators of the mining properties 
we do not participate in the preparation or calculation of the operators estimates or production reports and have not independently assessed or verified the accuracy of such information

table of contents critical accounting policies listed below are the accounting policies that the company believes are critical to its financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset  liability  revenue or expense being reported 
please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements 
use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our most critical accounting estimates relate to our assumptions regarding future gold  silver  nickel  copper and other metal prices and the estimates of reserves and recoveries of third party mine operators 
we rely on reserve estimates reported by the operators on the properties in which we have royalty interests 
these estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the potential impairments of long lived assets and the ability to realize income tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets 
these estimates and assumptions also affect the rate at which we charge depreciation  depletion and amortization to earnings 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates these estimates and assumptions  however  actual amounts could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
royalty interests in mineral properties royalty interests in mineral properties include acquired royalty interests in production  development and exploration stage properties 
the costs of acquired royalty interests in mineral properties are capitalized as tangible assets as such interests do not meet the definition of a financial asset under the accounting standards codification asc guidance 
acquisition costs of production and development stage royalty interests are depleted using the units of production method over the life of the mineral property  which is estimated using proven and probable reserves 
acquisition costs of royalty interests on exploration stage mineral properties  where there are no proven and probable reserves  are not amortized 
at such time as the associated exploration stage mineral interests are converted to proven and probable reserves  the cost basis is amortized over the remaining life of the mineral property  using proven and probable reserves 
the carrying values of exploration stage mineral interests are evaluated for impairment at such time as information becomes available indicating that the production will not occur in the future 
exploration costs are expensed when incurred 
asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of the carrying value of royalty interests in production and development stage mineral properties is evaluated based upon estimated future undiscounted net cash flows from each royalty interest property using estimates of proven and probable reserves and other relevant information received from the operators 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of royalty interests in exploration stage mineral properties in the event of significant decreases in the price of gold  silver  copper  nickel and other metals  and whenever new information regarding the mineral properties is obtained from the operator indicating that production will not likely occur in the future thus affecting the future recoverability of our royalty interests 
impairments in the carrying value of each property are 
table of contents measured and recorded to the extent that the carrying value in each property exceeds its estimated fair value  which is generally calculated using estimated future discounted cash flows 
our estimates of gold  silver  copper  nickel and other metal prices  operator estimates of proven and probable reserves related to our royalty properties  and operator estimates of operating  capital and reclamation costs are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which may affect the recoverability of our investment in these royalty interests in mineral properties 
although we have made our best assessment of these factors based on current conditions  it is possible that changes could occur  which could adversely affect the net cash flows expected to be generated from these royalty interests 
royalty revenue royalty revenue is recognized pursuant to guidance in asc and based upon amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying royalty agreement 
specifically  revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the underlying royalty agreements subject to i the pervasive evidence of the existence of the arrangements  ii the risks and rewards having been transferred  iii the royalty being fixed or determinable  and iv the collectability of the royalty being reasonably assured 
for royalty payments received in kind  royalty revenue is recorded at the average spot price of gold for the period in which the royalty was earned 
revenue recognized pursuant to the robinson royalty agreement is based upon of revenue received by the operator of the mine  quadra  for the sale of minerals from the robinson mine  reduced by certain costs incurred by quadra 
quadra concentrate sales contracts with third party smelters  in general  provide for an initial sales price payment based upon provisional assays and quoted metal prices at the date of shipment 
final true up sales price payments to quadra are subsequently based upon final assay and market metal prices on a specified future date  typically one to three months after the date the concentrate arrives at the third party smelter which generally occurs four to five months after the shipment date from the robinson mine 
we do not have all the key information regarding the terms of the operator smelter contracts  such as the terms of specific concentrate shipments to a smelter or quantities of metal or expected settlement arrangements at the time of an operator shipment of concentrate 
each monthly payment from quadra is typically a combination of revenue received by quadra for provisional payments during the month and any upward or downward adjustments for final assays and commodity prices for earlier shipments 
whether the payment to royal gold is based on quadra revenue in the form of provisional or final payments  royal gold records royalty revenue and the corresponding receivable based on the monthly amounts it receives from quadra  as determined pursuant to the royalty agreement 
the royalty contract does not provide royal gold with rights or obligations to settle any final assay and commodity price adjustments with quadra 
therefore  once a given monthly payment is received by royal gold it is not subject to later adjustment based on adjustments for assays or commodity prices 
under the royalty agreement  quadra may include such final adjustments as a component of future royalty payments 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the guidance of asc the company deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts measured by tax laws and regulations 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when management concludes it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

table of contents the company operations may involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions 
the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors  including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal  state  and international tax audits 
the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if the company estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional charge to income tax expense would result 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment  a tax benefit would result 
the company recognizes interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
reclassification cost and expenses previously classified as exploration and business development are now included within the general and administrative caption 
further  certain amounts previously classified as costs of operations are now included within the general and administrative caption or the production taxes caption in the company consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
the following table reflects these reclassifications for the fiscal years ended june  and fiscal year ended june  fiscal year ended june  previously reported balance reclass adjustment adjusted balance previously reported balance reclass adjustment adjusted balance costs and expenses costs of operations general and administrative production taxes exploration and business development these reclassifications had no effect on reported operating income or net income attributable to royal gold stockholders for the prior periods presented 
liquidity and capital resources overview at june   we had current assets of million compared to current liabilities of million for a current ratio of to this compares to current assets of million and current liabilities of million at june   resulting in a current ratio of approximately to the decrease in the current ratio is primarily due to a decrease in cash and equivalents during the period 
cash and equivalents decreased during the period as the company invested an aggregate of million from its available cash on hand for the investment in seabridge and the related option to acquire a royalty on the kerr sulphurets mitchell project in june  the mt

refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements and below for further discussion on our debt 

table of contents we believe that our current financial resources and funds generated from operations will be adequate to cover anticipated expenditures for debt service current and long term  general and administrative expense costs  exploration costs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
our current financial resources are also available to fund dividends and for royalty acquisitions  including the million commitment as part of the mt 
milligan gold purchase transaction 
our long term capital requirements are primarily affected by our ongoing acquisition activities 
the company currently  and generally at any time  has acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review 
in the event of a substantial royalty or other acquisition  we would seek additional debt or equity financing opportunities as necessary
