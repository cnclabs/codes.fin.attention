results of operations comparison of years ended december  and consolidated year ended december  change in millions  except share amounts consolidated revenues income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income loss net income loss per common share we reported net income of million or per share for compared to a net loss of million or per share for net income for includes settlement and curtailment gains totaling million from the termination of our postretirement health and life benefits  of which million was included in discontinued operations because they related to retirees from our former agriculture operations 
at the end of  we ceased all of our agriculture segment operations and we are reporting that segment as discontinued operations 
net income for also includes a million recognized gain from the march sale of the pgc 
losses from our equity investment in bay holdings of million in  impairment charges related to obsolete development plans  employee severance charges incurred as we downsized our operations  and operating losses from our resort operations caused by low visitor counts  were largely responsible for the losses in consolidated revenues were million and million in and  respectively 
most of the decrease in revenues in was due to the absence of revenues from the kapalua villas and the kapalua adventures as these operations were leased to third parties in december 
table of contents general and administrative in  general and administrative expenses decreased by to million compared to million for general and administrative salaries  wages  and stock compensation were lower in compared to by million due to a reduction in size of our workforce by approximately employees in and by approximately employees in in march  approximately positions were eliminated in the resort and community development segments and in corporate services in an effort to reduce costs  most of the other headcount reductions took place in december with the cessation of our agriculture segment operations  and transfer of the kapalua villas  kapalua adventures  and kapalua resort security and shuttle operations to third party operators 
in addition  a wage reduction was implemented in march that affected nearly all employees 
employee severance expense decreased by million in due primarily to fewer terminations 
pension and other postretirement expense decreased by million in due to the termination of our postretirement health and life insurance benefits for all retirees 
these actions resulted in settlement and curtailment gains totaling million in of which million was credited to discontinued operations 
in addition  our non bargaining pension plan was frozen as of january   so there was no service cost accrued for this plan in general and administrative expenses are incurred at the corporate level and at the operating segment level 
all general and administrative expenses incurred at the corporate level are allocated to the operating segments 
such allocations are consistent with our management evaluation of services provided to the operating segments 
interest expense interest expense was  for compared to  for the reduction in interest expense was primarily due to lower average interest rates and lower average borrowings in  and the extinguishment of our million convertible notes in august note to consolidated financial statements 
our average interest rate on borrowings was for compared to for and average borrowings were approximately million less in compared to community development year ended december  change in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating profit loss the community development segment reported an operating profit of million for compared to an operating loss of million for revenues from this operating segment were million for compared to million for the operating loss from this segment in largely reflects losses from our investment in bay holdings 
also in we recorded a charge of million for the write off of development plans and other project costs that were abandoned or were not otherwise expected to be recoverable because of the delay of the start of construction of new development projects caused by  among other things  the recent economic recession  uncertainty in the credit markets  high unemployment rates  reduced demand for investment real estate  and low consumer confidence 

table of contents in september  bay holdings recorded a million charge representing an impairment of the value of the residences at kapalua bay project 
we recorded losses from this joint venture of million in and stopped recording our share of bay holdings losses after our investment balance and other amounts advanced to bay holdings were reduced to zero  and the estimated remaining obligations to the joint venture were accrued 
in june  construction of the residences at kapalua bay project was substantially completed and through the end of  the sale of out of total whole ownership units and fractional out of total units had closed escrow note to consolidated financial statements 
real estate sales in  three real estate inventory sales resulted in revenues of million and pre tax income of million 
real estate inventory sales in produced revenues of million and pre tax income of million 
the real estate sales included the sale of the last lot in honolua ridge phase ii and two other land sale transactions 
our honolua ridge phase ii subdivision consisted of agricultural zoned lots  which began selling in august real estate development and sales are cyclical and depend on a number of factors see the risk factor entitled real estate investments are subject to numerous risks and we are negatively impacted by the downturn in the real estate market beginning in late under risk factors in item a above 
results for one period are therefore not necessarily indicative of future performance trends in this segment 
resort year ended december  change in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating profit loss the resort segment reported an operating profit of million for compared to an operating loss of million for resort segment revenues were million for compared to million for the decrease in resort segment revenues for primarily reflect the absence of revenues from the kapalua villas and kapalua adventures in as these operations were leased to third party operators in december we are now receiving lease and license income related to these operations that is reflected in the community development segment results 
partially offsetting the decrease in resort operations revenues from the kapalua villas and kapalua adventures was an increase in revenues from the kapalua spa that began operating in july operating profit for includes a million gain from the march sale of the pgc note to consolidated financial statements 
the improved results in also reflect better results from our golf and spa operations and general cost reductions throughout the resort segment operations 
the results reported by our operating segments include allocations of corporate and administrative overhead charges 
visitor counts to maui in increased over  which also contributed to the improved results 

table of contents golf and retail revenues from golf operations increased by in compared to primarily due to higher average green and cart fees 
paid rounds of golf decreased by approximately in compared to resort retail sales for were approximately lower than sales for  primarily reflecting the reduced spending by guests and a reduction in retail and food and beverage space with the closure of the kapalua adventures retail and caf in december and the closure of our tennis retail area in november effective april   we will no longer be the lessee and operator of the two kapalua golf courses 
in  these operations produced revenues of approximately million and a pre tax loss of approximately million

income from discontinued operations for includes million of settlement and curtailment gains from the termination of our postretirement health and life insurance plans 
the loss from discontinued operations for includes net charges of million related to the sale or other disposition of the agriculture segment assets  employee severance and cancellation of contracts 
liquidity and capital resources current debt position at december   our total debt  including capital leases  was million  which represents a decrease of million from december  the decrease in outstanding debt was primarily due to the repayment of million of outstanding debt as a result of i the completion of our million rights offering in july note to consolidated financial statements  and ii the sale of the bay course and maintenance facility in september for million in cash note to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the completion of our rights offering  our convertible notes with face value of million and book value of million were repaid at of their face value  or million in august in consideration of the release of the bay course from the collateral of our million revolving line of credit  we repaid million of outstanding borrowings under that line and the availability under the line was commensurately reduced 
at december   we had approximately million available under our revolving line of credit and million in cash and cash equivalents 
revolving line of credit with wells fargo bank  national association wells fargo we are parties to an amended and restated credit agreement with wells fargo as amended and modified from time to time  the line of credit  which initially provided a million revolving line of credit 
on september   in connection with our sale of the bay course and the concurrent repayment of million of borrowings under the line of credit  we entered into a first modification 
table of contents agreement with wells fargo  which reduced our availability under the line of credit to million and released the bay course from the collateral securing the line of credit 
on december   we entered into a second modification agreement and waiver with wells fargo  which further amended the line of credit by i extending the maturity date from march  to may   ii reducing the amount available under the million commitment to million in revolving loans and million in letters of credit  iii reducing the interest rate from libor plus to libor plus and eliminating the interest rate floor  and iv amending the financial covenants by reducing the minimum liquidity requirement from million to million  and reducing the maximum amount of total liabilities that may be owed by us from million to million 
on february   we entered into a third modification agreement with wells fargo  which further amended the line of credit by i extending the maturity date from may  to may   ii providing us with the option to further extend the maturity date to may   subject to the satisfactory achievement of certain pre defined conditions  and iii increasing the revolving credit commitment from million to million and availability under the loan facility from million to million 
as of december   we had irrevocable letters of credit totaling million that were secured by the line of credit  million of borrowings outstanding and million available for borrowing under the line of credit 
as of february   following execution of the third modification agreement  we had million available for borrowing under the line of credit 
term loan with american agcredit  flca american agcredit in september  we entered into a revolving line of credit agreement with american agcredit pursuant to which we were initially provided with a million revolving line of credit 
the revolving line of credit was amended on several occasions thereafter 
on december   we entered into a loan agreement the loan agreement with american agcredit that effectively amended and restated the revolving line of credit agreement  as amended 
the loan agreement amended the terms of the revolving line of credit agreement by i extending the maturity date from march  to may   ii changing the facility from a revolving line of credit to a term loan  iii eliminating the interest rate floor and specifying an interest rate based on the greater of or the day libor rate  plus an applicable spread of subject to reduction based on the principal balance of the loan  and iv amending the financial covenants by reducing the minimum liquidity requirement from million to million and reducing the maximum amount of total liabilities that may be owed by us from million to million 
upon entry into the third modification agreement with wells fargo discussed above  the maturity date of the loan agreement was automatically extended from may  to may  repurchase of senior secured convertible notes in july  we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional accredited investors and issued an aggregate of million in principal amount of the convertible notes 
the convertible notes accrued interest at a rate of per annum payable quarterly in cash in arrears 
the convertible notes were convertible  at any time following their issuance  into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
following the completion of our rights offering in july  we repurchased the full million of the convertible notes for of their face value  or million in the aggregate  plus a lock up fee of of face value  or  in the aggregate 

table of contents amended construction loan agreement with lehman brothers holdings inc bay holdings has a construction loan agreement with lehman and other lenders under which million was outstanding at december  the loan is collateralized by the residences of kapalua bay project assets including the land that underlies the project  which is owned by bay holdings 
we and the other members of bay holdings have guaranteed to the lenders completion of the project and recourse with regard to certain acts  but have not guaranteed payment of the loan 
bay holdings is currently in negotiations with the lenders to restructure the terms of the loan agreement to extend the maturity date and to provide available funding for continued operations 
operating cash flows net cash used in operating activities for and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities is primarily due to staff reductions and other cost cutting measures implemented in and interest paid in and was million and million  respectively 
tax refunds received in and were million and million  respectively 
investing and financing cash flows cash provided by investing and financing activities in included the following significant transactions gross proceeds from our right offering were million 
sale of the bay course produced net cash proceeds of million sale of three properties and miscellaneous equipment that were used in operations produced cash proceeds of million 
cash used in investing and financing activities in included the following significant transactions net payments of long term debt totaled million 
this included million of proceeds from the sale of the bay course and million of proceeds from the rights offering that were applied to pay down outstanding borrowings 
cash outflow for property purchases was million and was primarily for the replacement of the irrigation system at the pgc as required by the sale of the golf course in cash provided by investing and financing activities in included the following significant transactions sale of the pgc produced cash proceeds of million 
sale of two properties and miscellaneous equipment that were used in operations produced cash proceeds of million 
cash used in investing and financing activities in included the following significant transactions net payments of long term debt totaled million  as million in proceeds from sale of the pgc was used to pay down outstanding borrowings 
cash outflow  primarily for replacement of equipment and facilities in our resort and community development segments totaled million 

table of contents future cash inflows and outflows our plans for include the possible sale of certain operating and non operating real estate assets that could result in net cash proceeds which would be partially used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for general working capital 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell any of our real estate assets on acceptable terms  if at all 
our cash outlook for the next twelve months and our ability to continue to meet our financial covenants is highly dependent on selling certain real estate assets in a difficult market 
if we are unable to meet our financial covenants resulting in the borrowings becoming immediately due  we would not have sufficient liquidity to repay such outstanding borrowings 
in addition  we are subject to several commitments and contingencies that could negatively impact our future cash flows  including commitments related to our investment in bay holdings to purchase the spa  beach club improvements and the sundry store the amenities  an ongoing dispute with the lpga  an eeoc matter related to our discontinued agricultural operations  and funding requirements related to our defined benefit pension plans 
these matters are further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the aforementioned circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully achieve the initiatives discussed below in order to continue as a going concern 
in response to these circumstances  we continue to undertake several financial and strategic initiatives to reduce cash commitments  to generate cash flow from a variety of sources and to further reduce our debt  including the sale of several real estate assets and cost reduction efforts 
as part of the restructured credit agreement with wells fargo  we are allowed to use proceeds from the sale of certain properties to settle obligations related to our prior operations  instead of reducing borrowings under the line of credit as was previously required in the credit agreement 
we are currently in discussions with the other members of bay holdings and the lenders to negotiate the terms of the purchase and sale agreement including the purchase and payment terms  and are discussing whether we will even be required to purchase the amenities 
net cash outflows in attributable to our golf operations were approximately million including million annual lease rent for the pgc 
this cash outflow will cease effective april  contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately million in in  capital expenditures are expected to be incurred only as critically necessary 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in summary of significant accounting policies  note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of accounting estimates 
some of these estimates and assumptions involve a high level of subjectivity and judgment and therefore the impact of a change in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
the accounting policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to the consolidated financial statements are as follows our investment in bay holdings was written down to zero at december  to recognize an other than temporary impairment and to record losses incurred by bay holdings in the third quarter of in  we recorded impairment charges totaling million and equity in losses of bay holdings of million 
the equity in losses that we recorded was limited to the remaining carrying value of the investment on our consolidated balance sheet and our estimated share of completion and recourse guarantees 
bay holdings recorded losses of million in which included a million charge to reflect an impairment of the carrying value of its 
table of contents real estate inventories whole and fractional condominium units held for sale 
the impairment loss reflects higher estimated default rates on actual whole and fractional unit closings than was previously anticipated  and also reflects a change in forecasted sales revenue on the unsold whole and fractional units that substantially reduced the expected margins on the unsold units 
in determining the fair value of this investment and assessing whether any identified impairment was other than temporary  significant estimates and considerable judgment were involved 
these estimates and judgments were based  in part  on our current and future evaluation of economic conditions in general  as well as bay holdings current and future plans 
these impairment calculations contain additional uncertainties because they also require management to make assumptions and apply judgments to  among others  estimates of future cash flows  probabilities related to various cash flow scenarios  and appropriate discount rates 
the impairment losses recorded by bay holdings required bay holdings management to estimate total sales revenues that will be received by the project  as well as estimating the number of buyers of units from which nonrefundable deposits have been received that will not close on the purchase of their units 
our long lived assets are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived asset may not be recoverable 
management has evaluated certain long lived assets for impairment  and in has recognized impairment charges totaling million related to related to real estate assets held for sale or held as investment because carrying values were in excess of estimated fair values less the estimated costs of disposal 
in  impairment charges related to deferred development costs of million for costs that are not expected to be recovered due to the delay of the start of construction of new development projects and due to the decision to not proceed with certain projects 
these asset impairment loss analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and apply considerable judgments to  among others  estimates of the timing and amount of future cash flows  expected useful lives of the assets  uncertainty about future events  including changes in economic conditions  changes in operating performance  changes in the use of the assets  and ongoing costs of maintenance and improvements of the assets  thus  the accounting estimates may change from period to period 
if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods  our financial condition or future operating results could be materially impacted 
deferred development costs  principally predevelopment costs and offsite development costs related to various projects in the planning stages by our community development segment  totaled million at year end based on our future development plans for the kapalua resort and other properties such as kapalua mauka  the village at kapalua  pulelehua  and hali imaile town  and the estimated value of these future projects  management has concluded that these deferred costs will be recoverable from future development projects 
the volatility of this assumption arises because of the long term nature of our development plans and the uncertainty of when or if certain parcels will be developed 
determining pension expense for our two defined benefit pension plans utilizes actuarial estimates of employees expected service period  age at retirement  and compensation levels  as well as estimates regarding employee turnover  the long term rate of return on investments and other factors 
other post retirement benefits for life insurance and health care utilize actuarial estimates as to the retirees life span  the cost of future health insurance premiums and utilization of health benefits by the employees 
in addition  both pension and other post retirement expenses are sensitive to the discount rate utilized 
this rate should be commensurate to the interest rate yield of a high quality corporate fixed income investment portfolio 
these assumptions are subject to the risk of change as they require significant judgment and have inherent uncertainties that management or its consulting actuaries may not control or anticipate 

table of contents as of december   the fair value of the assets of our defined benefit plans totaled approximately million  compared with million as of december  the recorded net pension liability was approximately million as of december   compared to a net pension liability of million as of december  the post retirement life and health insurance plans were terminated in and the net recorded liability for such benefits was zero at december  and million at december  stock based compensation expense is calculated based on assumptions as to the expected life of the options  price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected forfeitures 
while management believes that the assumptions made are appropriate  compensation expense recorded currently and future compensation expense would vary based on the assumptions used 
management calculates the income tax provision  current and deferred income taxes along with the valuation allowance based upon various complex estimates and interpretations of income tax laws and regulations 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
to the extent we begin to generate taxable income in future years  and it is determined the valuation allowance is no longer required  the tax benefit for the remaining deferred tax assets will be recognized at such time 
as of december   valuation allowances of million have been established primarily for tax credits  net operating loss carryforwards  and accrued retirement benefits to reduce future tax benefits expected to be realized 
our results of operations could be affected by significant litigation or contingencies adverse to the company  including  but not limited to  liability claims  environmental matters  and contract terminations 
we record accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we make adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter 
predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from those estimates 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  we consider many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the nature of specific claims  our experience with similar types of claims  the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed  input from outside legal counsel  the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter current status 
a detailed discussion of significant litigation matters and contingencies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
see note to consolidated financial statements for a full description of the impact of recently issued accounting standards  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations and financial condition 
impact of inflation and changing prices most of the land owned by us was acquired from to and is carried at cost 
a small portion of real estate inventories represents land cost 
at kapalua  some of the fixed assets were constructed and placed in service in the mid to late s 
depreciation expense would be considerably higher if fixed assets were stated at current cost

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk because we qualify as a smaller reporting company  as defined in item f of regulation s k  we are not required to provide the information required by this item
