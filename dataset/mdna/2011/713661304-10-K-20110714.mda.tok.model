item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is included to describe our financial position and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended april  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company driven to develop and manufacture first in class monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer and viral infections 
we are advancing our two phase ii oncology programs with our lead product candidates bavituximab and cotara as well as our phase ii hepatitis c virus hcv program for bavituximab 
our pipeline of novel investigational monoclonal antibodies is based on two first in class technology platforms  including phosphatidylserine ps targeting antibodies and dna histone targeting antibodies 
bavituximab is our lead ps targeting antibody that has demonstrated broad therapeutic potential and represents a new approach to treating cancer 
ps is a highly immunosuppressive molecule usually located inside the membrane of healthy cells  but flips and becomes exposed on the outside of cells that line tumor blood vessels  creating a specific target for anti cancer treatments 
ps targeting antibodies target and bind to ps and block this immunosuppressive signal  thereby enabling the immune system to recognize and fight the tumor 
with respect to our bavituximab oncology program  we are currently conducting three randomized phase ii trials for bavituximab in combination with standard chemotherapy for front and second line non small cell lung cancer nsclc and previously untreated pancreatic cancer 
in addition to these company sponsored trials for bavituximab  we have also initiated four investigator sponsored trials ist as a means to evaluate new drug combinations and additional oncology indications 
current ist s include  i a phase i ii trial evaluating bavituximab combined with sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma hcc  or liver cancer  ii a phase i ii trial evaluating bavituximab combined with cabazitaxel in patients with second line castration resistant prostate cancer crpc  iii a phase ib trial evaluating bavituximab combined with pemetrexed and carboplatin in patients with front line nsclc  and iv a phase i trial evaluating bavituximab combined with paclitaxel in patients with her negative metastatic breast cancer 
for bavituximab in antiviral indications  we are advancing a randomized phase ii trial of bavituximab in combination with ribavirin for na ve  genotype hcv patients 
cotara is our lead dna histone targeting antibody based on our tumor necrosis therapy tnt technology platform 
a novel approach to treating brain cancer  cotara is a targeted monoclonal antibody linked to a radioisotope that is administered as a single infusion  one time therapy directly into the tumor  destroying the tumor from the inside out  with minimal exposure to healthy tissue 
with respect to our cotara brain cancer program that uses a single standalone treatment  we have recently reported promising interim median overall survival of months from a phase ii trial for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme gbm  the deadliest form of brain cancer 
cotara has been granted orphan drug status and fast track designation for the treatment of gbm and anaplastic astrocytoma by the us food and drug administration fda 
in addition to our clinical research and development efforts  we operate a wholly owned cgmp current good manufacturing practices contract manufacturing subsidiary  avid bioservices  inc avid 
avid is a contract manufacturing organization that provides fully integrated services from cell line development to commercial cgmp biomanufacturing for peregrine and avid s third party clients 
in addition to generating revenue from providing a broad range of biomanufacturing services to third party clients  avid is strategically integrated with peregrine to manufacture all clinical products to support our clinical trials while also preparing peregrine s products for potential commercial launch 
going concern our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the recorded assets or the classification of liabilities that may be necessary should it be determined that we are unable to continue as a going concern 
at april   we had  in cash and cash equivalents 
we have expended substantial funds on the research  development and clinical trials of our product candidates  and funding the operations of avid 
as a result  we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operations since our inception and we expect the negative cash flows from operations to continue for the foreseeable future 
our net losses incurred during the past three fiscal years ended april   and amounted to   and  respectively 
unless and until we are able to generate sufficient revenues from avid s contract manufacturing services and or from the sale and or licensing of our products under development  we expect such losses to continue for the foreseeable future 
therefore  our ability to continue our clinical trials and development efforts is highly dependent on the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand combined with our ability to raise additional capital to support our future operations through one or more methods  including but not limited to  issuing additional equity or debt 
with respect to financing our operations through the issuance of equity  during fiscal year  we raised  in gross proceeds as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to april  and through june  we raised  in gross proceeds as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of june   additional shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of up to  are available under two effective shelf registration statements 
although we believe we can raise sufficient capital to meet our obligations through fiscal year  our ability to raise additional capital in the equity markets is dependent on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the market demand for our common stock 
the market demand or liquidity of our common stock is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to  negative economic conditions  adverse market conditions  adverse clinical trials results  and significant delays in one or more clinical trials 
if our ability to access the capital markets becomes severely restricted  it could have a negative impact on our business plans  including our clinical trial programs and other research and development activities 
in addition  even if we are able to raise additional capital  it may not be at a price or on terms that are favorable to us 
we may also raise additional capital through licensing our products in development  procuring new government contracts and grants  or increasing revenue from our wholly owned subsidiary  avid 
with respect to financing our operations through procuring government contracts and grants  on october   we were awarded an aggregate cash grant of approximately  under section d of the internal revenue code as reimbursement for four separate qualifying therapeutic discovery projects  which we applied for under the patient protection and affordable care act of while we will continue to explore these potential opportunities  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in procuring additional government contracts and grants  or that sufficient additional revenue will be generated from avid or under potential licensing or partnering agreements to complete the research  development  and clinical testing of our product candidates 
based on our current projections  which include projected revenues under signed contracts with existing customers of avid  and assuming we do not generate any additional revenues or raise any additional capital from the capital markets or other potential sources  we believe we have sufficient cash on hand combined with amounts expected to be received from avid customers to meet our obligations as they become due through at least the second quarter of our fiscal year ending october  there are a number of uncertainties associated with our financial projections  including but not limited to  termination of third party contracts  technical challenges  the rate at which patients are enrolled into any current or future clinical trials  of which  could reduce or delay our future projected cash flows 
in addition  in the event our projected cash inflows are reduced or delayed we might not have sufficient capital to operate our business through the second quarter of our fiscal year unless we raise additional capital 
the uncertainties surrounding our future cash inflows have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
results of operations the following table compares the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended april   and this table provides an overview of the changes in the statement of operations for the comparative periods  which changes are further discussed below 
years ended april  years ended april  change change revenues contract manufacturing government contract revenue license revenue total revenues cost and expenses cost of contract manufacturing research and development selling  general and administrative total cost and expenses loss from operations other income expense interest and other income interest and other expense net loss contract manufacturing revenue year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the decrease in contract manufacturing revenue of  or during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in the level of services provided to third party customers compared to the prior year combined with the timing of services provided to third party customers 
the current year decrease in services was primarily due to the loss of two customers in fiscal year that were acquired by larger companies with internal manufacturing capabilities  which was offset by the addition of a new customer in fiscal year each of the aforementioned customers represented more than of contract manufacturing revenue in the respective fiscal years 
in addition  the timing of services provided to third party customers also attributed to the decrease in contract manufacturing revenue as we initiated several third party manufacturing runs during the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year  all of which were still in process as of april  we expect contract manufacturing revenue for fiscal year to be in line with fiscal year based on the anticipated completion of in process third party customer related projects and the anticipated demand for avid s services under signed and anticipated new contracts 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  contract manufacturing revenue for the year ended april  remained in line with fiscal year increasing slightly by  or 
this increase in contract manufacturing revenue was primarily due to an increase in manufacturing services provided by avid to third party customers on a fee for service basis compared to fiscal year government contract revenue year ended april  compared to the year ended april  government contract revenue stems from a contract awarded to us on june   through the transformational medical technologies tmt of the us department of defense defense threat reduction agency 
the purpose of the contract  which expired on april   was to test and develop bavituximab and an equivalent fully human antibody as potential broad spectrum treatments for viral hemorrhagic fever infections 
the decrease in government contract revenue of  or during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was due to a decrease in the level of research and development services performed during the current year in accordance with the contract s project plan 
as of april   we had recognized  in total government contract revenue under this contract  of which we recognized  during fiscal year   during fiscal year and  during fiscal year due to the expiration of this contract on april   government contract revenue recognized beyond fiscal year would be insignificant  if any  unless we secure additional government contracts 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in government contract revenue of  or during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was due to an increase in research and development services performed under the government contract awarded through the tmt of the us department of defense s defense threat reduction agency  as preclinical and manufacturing activities increased compared to fiscal year in addition  since this contract was signed on june   there was no corresponding revenue generated during the initial two months of fiscal year license revenue the increase in license revenue of  and  during the years ended april  and  respectively  compared to fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively  was directly related to revenue recognized under a license agreement we entered into with affitech a s during july associated with our anti vegf antibody technology 
although we expect to continue to recognize license revenue under our license agreements with unrelated entities during fiscal year  we do not expect license revenue to significantly increase from fiscal year based on our current license agreements 
cost of contract manufacturing year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the decrease in cost of contract manufacturing of  or during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily related to the current year decrease in contract manufacturing revenue 
in addition  the cost of contract manufacturing as a percentage of contract manufacturing revenue increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year  which was primarily due to i the current year decrease in the level of manufacturing services provided to third party customers due to the decrease in the number of completed manufacturing runs  and ii the write off of certain material manufactured for a third party customer that did not meet certain specifications for product release 
we expect to continue to incur contract manufacturing costs during fiscal year based on the anticipated completion of third party customer related projects under our current contract manufacturing agreements 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  cost of contract manufacturing for the year ended april  remained in line with fiscal year decreasing slightly by  or 
in addition  the cost of contract manufacturing as a percentage of contract manufacturing revenue improved from in fiscal year to in fiscal year  which was directly related to the increase in contract manufacturing revenue related to the increase in manufacturing services 
research and development expenses year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in research and development r d expenses of  or during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was due to the following changes associated with each of our following platform technologies under development r d expenses fiscal year ended april  change technology platform phosphatidylserine ps targeting bavituximab tnt cotara other total r d expenses o ps targeting technology platform bavituximab the increase in ps targeting program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily due to increases in clinical trial and related expenses  payroll and related expenses  share based compensation expense non cash  and consulting fees to support the advancement of our later stage clinical program for bavituximab 
during the current fiscal year  we initiated three separate randomized multi center phase ii clinical trials using bavituximab in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with i front line non small cell lung cancer nsclc  ii second line nsclc  and iii pancreatic cancer 
we also initiated a randomized phase ii clinical trial using bavituximab for the treatment of patients with previously untreated genotype hepatitis c virus hcv infection 
in addition to our company sponsored later stage phase ii clinical trials  we also established an investigator sponsored trial program during the current fiscal year that resulted in three new studies using bavituximab for the treatment of patients with liver cancer  her negative metastatic breast cancer  and locally advanced or metastatic nsclc 
these ps targeting clinical program expenses were further supplemented by increases in r d expenses associated with the development of additional ps targeting antibodies 
these increases in ps targeting program expenses were offset with a decrease in r d expenses directly related to our government contract with the tmt  which expired on april   as the level of r d activities performed under the government contract had decreased compared to the prior year in accordance with the project plan under the contract 
o tumor necrosis therapy tnt technology platform cotara tnt program expenses for the year ended april  remained in line with the prior year and increased slightly by  as we continued our efforts to advance our cotara clinical program  including the completion of a phase ii trial using cotara for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme or brain cancer 
o other r d programs the decrease in our other r d program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily due to our efforts to curtail spending on earlier stage technologies associated with our anti angiogenesis agents and vascular targeting agents in order to focus our efforts and resources on our current later stage clinical programs 
however  we are actively seeking partners to further develop these technologies 
based on our current projections  which includes estimated clinical trial enrollment rates that are always uncertain  we expect research and development expenses in fiscal year to increase in comparison to fiscal year as we plan to i advance our three later stage phase ii clinical programs for bavituximab and cotara towards phase iii development  ii explore additional oncology indications and therapeutic combinations for bavituximab through our cost effective investigator sponsored trials program  and iii prepare for commercial scale manufacturing of our own products through our wholly owned biomanufacturing subsidiary  avid bioservices 
during fiscal year  we expect to continue to direct the majority of our research and development expenses towards our ps targeting technology platform 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in research and development r d expenses of  or during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was due to the following changes associated with each of our following platform technologies under development r d expenses fiscal year ended april  change technology platform phosphatidylserine ps targeting bavituximab tnt cotara other total r d expenses o ps targeting technology platform bavituximab the increase in ps targeting program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in r d expenses directly associated with our efforts to advance the development of bavituximab and a fully human antibody as potential broad spectrum treatments for viral hemorrhagic fever infections under our government contract with the tmt as pre clinical and manufacturing activities performed under the contract have increased compared to the prior year 
the increase in ps targeting program expenses was further supplemented with an increase in clinical trial and related expenses to support the advancement of our bavituximab clinical program 
during fiscal year  we completed patient enrollment in one phase i and three phase ii single arm clinical studies using bavituximab for the treatment of solid tumors 
in addition  based on positive signs of activity from these phase ii single arm clinical studies  we began to incur expenses during fiscal year associated with larger multi center phase iib randomized trials that were initiated in fiscal year this initial ground work included the submission of two separate phase iib clinical protocols using bavituximab in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with front line and second line nsclc 
o tumor necrosis therapy tnt technology platform cotara the decrease in tnt program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in clinical trial expenses associated with the timing of patient enrollment in our two cotara clinical trials for the treatment of brain cancer  one of which completed patient enrollment during december the decrease in tnt program expenses was further supplemented by a decrease in our in house tnt development efforts as our in house development efforts were focused primarily on our ps targeting program 
o other r d programs the increase in our other r d program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in r d expenses associated with increased development efforts associated with the advancement of our anti angiogenesis agent  r antibody  that was subsequently licensed to a unaffiliated entity in july looking beyond the next twelve months  we expect to continue to direct the majority of our research and development expenses towards our ps targeting technology platform although it is extremely difficult for us to reasonably estimate all future research and development costs associated with each of our technologies due to the number of unknowns and uncertainties associated with preclinical and clinical trial development 
these unknown variables and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the uncertainty of future clinical trial results  the uncertainty of the ultimate number of patients to be treated in any current or future clinical trial  the uncertainty of the us food and drug administration allowing our studies to move forward from phase ii clinical studies to phase iii clinical studies  the uncertainty of the rate at which patients are enrolled into any current or future study 
any delays in clinical trials could significantly increase the cost of the study and would extend the estimated completion dates  the uncertainty of terms related to potential future partnering or licensing arrangements  the uncertainty of protocol changes and modifications in the design of our clinical trial studies  which may increase or decrease our future costs  and the uncertainty of our ability to raise additional capital to support our future research and development efforts beyond the second quarter of our fiscal year we or our potential partners will need to do additional development and clinical testing prior to seeking any regulatory approval for commercialization of our product candidates as all of our products are in discovery  preclinical or clinical development 
testing  manufacturing  commercialization  advertising  promotion  exporting  and marketing  among other things  of our proposed products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
the testing and approval process requires substantial time  effort  and financial resources  and we cannot guarantee that any approval will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in conducting advanced human clinical trials  even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials 
furthermore  the united states food and drug administration may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
even if regulatory approval of a product is granted  such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed 
accordingly  we or our potential partners may experience difficulties and delays in obtaining necessary governmental clearances and approvals to market our products 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended april  compared to the year ended april  selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses  director fees  share based compensation expense  legal and accounting fees  patent fees  investor and public relation fees  insurance  and other expenses relating to the general management  administration  and business development activities of the company 
the increase in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses of  or during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily due to increases in share based compensation expense non cash and payroll and related expenses 
the current year increase in share based compensation expense of  was primarily related to the amortization of the fair value of options granted to employees and board members under a broad based grant during february the current year increase in payroll and related expenses of  was primarily the result of increased employee headcount  compensation  and other employee related expenses to support our later stage clinical development activities 
these increases were further supplemented with current year increases associated with patent filing and maintenance fees  market research analysis fees  travel and related expenses  facility related expenses  and other general corporate related expenses 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in sg a expenses of  or during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was primarily due to increases in payroll and related expense and share based compensation expense offset by a decrease in corporate legal fees 
the fiscal year increase in payroll and related expenses of  was primarily the result of an increase in headcount and related compensation  consulting  and recruiting expenses associated with the increase sg a activities  including non cash share based compensation expense of  associated with the amortization of the fair value of options and performance based restricted stock awards granted to employees during february we also incurred incremental increases in other general corporate related expenses primarily associated with travel and related expenses  audit and accounting fees  and facility related expenses 
these increases in sg a expenses were offset with a decrease in corporate legal fees which was primarily due to legal fees incurred in fiscal year associated with the settlement of a lawsuit regarding an out licensing agreement related to our tnt technology 
interest and other income year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in interest and other income of  during the year ended april   compared to the prior year was due to an increase in other income of  offset by a  decrease in interest income 
the increase in other income was directly related to the government grant of approximately  awarded to us during october under section d of the internal revenue code as reimbursement for four separate qualifying therapeutic discovery projects  which we applied for under the patient protection and affordable care act of year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the decrease in interest and other income of  during the year ended april   compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in interest income as a result of lower prevailing interest rates during fiscal year compared to fiscal year interest and other expense year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the decrease in interest and other expense of  during the year ended april  compared to prior year was primarily due to decreases in interest expense and non cash interest expense of  and  respectively  associated with the  term loan we secured in december due to a lower outstanding principal balance during the current fiscal year 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in interest and other expense of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a  increase in interest expense associated with the  term loan we secured in december combined with a  increase in non cash interest expense associated with the amortization of the fair value of detachable warrants and related debt issuance costs 
since the term loan was entered into during december  there were no corresponding interest or non cash interest amounts reported during the first two fiscal quarters of fiscal year critical accounting policies the preparation and presentation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  requires us to establish policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements 
in our judgment  our critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we currently derive revenue from the following two sources i contract manufacturing services provided by avid  and ii licensing revenues related to agreements associated with peregrine s technologies under development 
in addition  from june  through april  we derived government contract revenues from services provided under a government contract awarded to us through the transformational medical technologies tmt of the us department of defense s defense threat reduction agency 
the government contract with the tmt expired on april  we recognize revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery or passage of title has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the seller price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
we also comply with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition regarding arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in addition  we also follow the authoritative guidance when reporting revenue as gross when we act as a principal versus reporting revenue as net when we act as an agent 
for transactions in which we act as a principal  have discretion to choose suppliers  bear credit risk and perform a substantive part of the services  revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed to a customer and costs associated with these reimbursements are reflected as a component of cost of sales for contract manufacturing services and as a component of research and development expense for services provided under our former contract with the tmt contract expired on april  
contract manufacturing revenue revenue associated with contract manufacturing services provided by avid are recognized once the service has been rendered and or upon shipment or passage of title of the product to the customer 
on occasion  we recognize revenue on a bill and hold basis in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
under bill and hold arrangements  revenue is recognized once the product is complete and ready for shipment  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  management receives a written request from the customer for bill and hold treatment  the product is segregated from other inventory  and no further performance obligations exist 
there were no bill and hold arrangements outstanding as of april  any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we also record a provision for estimated contract losses  if any  in the period in which they are determined 
license revenue revenue associated with licensing agreements primarily consist of non refundable upfront license fees  non refundable annual license fees and milestone payments 
non refundable upfront license fees received under license agreements  whereby continued performance or future obligations are considered inconsequential to the relevant license technology  are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the technology 
if a license agreement has multiple element arrangements  we analyze and determine whether the deliverables  which often include performance obligations  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
under multiple element arrangements  we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the delivered element has stand alone value and we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for each undelivered element 
if the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement cannot be objectively determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  and revenue is recognized over the estimated period of when the performance obligation s are performed 
in addition  under certain circumstances  when there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items in an arrangement  but no such evidence for the delivered items  we utilize the residual method to allocate the consideration received under the arrangement 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to delivered items equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items  and revenue is recognized upon delivery of the undelivered items based on the relative fair value of the undelivered items 
revenue recognized under licensing agreements is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned as of the period ending date 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
non refundable annual license fees are recognized as revenue on the anniversary date of the agreement in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the specified milestone  provided that i the milestone event is substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  ii the fees are non refundable  and iii there is no continuing performance obligations associated with the milestone payment 
any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
government contract revenue on june   we were awarded a government contract the government contract to test and develop bavituximab and an equivalent fully human antibody as potential broad spectrum treatments for viral hemorrhagic fever vhf infections 
the government contract was awarded through the transformational medical technologies tmt of the us department of defense s defense threat reduction agency and expired on april  the government contract is classified as a cost plus fixed fee contract 
we recognize government contract revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition including the authoritative guidance specific to federal government contracts 
reimbursable costs under the contract primarily include direct labor  subcontract costs  materials  equipment  travel  and indirect costs 
in addition  we receive a fixed fee for our efforts equal to of the reimbursable costs incurred under the government contract  which is unconditionally earned as allowable costs are billed and is not contingent on success factors 
reimbursable costs under this government contract  including the fixed fee  are generally recognized as revenue in the period the reimbursable costs are incurred and become billable 
however  when amounts billable  including the fixed fee  are not reasonably related to the proportionate performance of the total work or services to be performed  we recognize revenue on a proportional performance basis 
in addition  reimbursable costs  including the fixed fee  associated with manufacturing services are recognized as revenue once delivery or passage of title has occurred 
amounts billable including the fixed fee prior to satisfying revenue recognition criteria are classified as deferred government contract revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation expense we account for stock options and awards granted under our equity compensation plans in accordance with the authoritative guidance for share based compensation 
the estimated fair value of share based payments to employees in exchange for services is measured at the grant date  using a fair value based method  and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods 
share based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of the share based payment that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
share based compensation expense for a share based payment with a performance condition is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period when the achievement of the performance condition is determined to be probable 
if a performance condition is not determined to be probable or is not met  no share based compensation is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated using the black scholes option valuation model  which requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
these model inputs include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility  actual and projected employee stock option exercise activity  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the expected volatility is based on the daily historical volatility of our stock covering the estimated expected term 
the expected term of options granted reflects actual historical exercise activity and assumptions regarding future exercise activity of unexercised  outstanding options 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury notes with terms within the contractual life of the option at the time of grant 
the expected dividend yield assumption is based on our expectation of future dividend payouts 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends 
in addition  guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the determination of fair value in future periods  the share based compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
there are a number of factors that affect the amount of share based compensation expense  including the number of employee options granted during subsequent fiscal years  the price of our common stock on the date of grant  the volatility of our stock price  the estimate of the expected life of options granted and the risk free interest rates 
in addition  we periodically grant stock options and awards to non employee consultants  which we account for in accordance with the authoritative guidance for share based compensation 
the cost of non employee services received in exchange for share based awards are measured based on either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the share based award issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
in addition  guidance requires share based compensation related to unvested options and awards issued to non employees to be recalculated at the end of each reporting period based upon the fair market value on that date until the share based award has vested  and any adjustment to share based compensation resulting from the remeasurement is recognized in the current period 
research and development research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred in accordance with the authoritative guidance for research and development costs 
research and development expenses primarily include i payroll and related costs associated with research and development personnel  ii costs related to clinical and pre clinical testing of our technologies under development  iii costs to develop and manufacture the product candidates  including raw materials and supplies  product testing  depreciation  and facility related expenses  iv expenses for research services provided by universities and contract laboratories  including sponsored research funding  and v other research and development expenses 
advance payments  including non refundable amounts  to secure the receipt of future research and development services are deferred and capitalized 
these pre payments are recognized as an expense in the period that the services are performed 
we assess our prepaid research and development expenses for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the prepaid expense may not be recoverable or provide future economic benefit 
in addition  we record research and development expenses based on accruals associated with work performed in connection with advancing our clinical trials  which relies on estimates and or representations from clinical research organizations cros  hospitals  consultants  and other clinical trial related vendors 
we maintain regular communication with our vendors  including our cro vendors  and gauge the reasonableness of estimates provided 
however  actual clinical trial costs may differ from estimated clinical trial costs and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
there were no material adjustments for a change in estimate to research and development expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in any of the three years ended april  fair value measurements we determine fair value measurements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures for all assets and liabilities within the scope of this guidance 
this guidance clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements 
the guidance also clarifies its application in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
the guidance prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into the following hierarchy level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level  such as assets or liabilities whose value are based on quoted market prices in markets where trading occurs infrequently or whose values are based on quoted prices of instruments with similar attributes in active markets 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
as of april   we do not have any level or level financial assets or liabilities and our cash and cash equivalents are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices for identical securities level input 
liquidity and capital resources at april   we had  in cash and cash equivalents 
we have expended substantial funds on the research  development and clinical trials of our product candidates  and funding the operations of avid 
as a result  we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operations since our inception and we expect the negative cash flows from operations to continue for the foreseeable future 
our net losses incurred during the past three fiscal years ended april   and amounted to   and  respectively 
unless and until we are able to generate sufficient revenues from avid s contract manufacturing services and or from the sale and or licensing of our products under development  we expect such losses to continue for the foreseeable future 
therefore  our ability to continue our clinical trials and development efforts is highly dependent on the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand combined with our ability to raise additional capital to support our future operations through one or more methods  including but not limited to  issuing additional equity or debt 
with respect to financing our operations through the issuance of equity  during fiscal year  we raised  in gross proceeds as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to april  and through june  we raised  in gross proceeds as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of june   additional shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of up to  are available under two effective shelf registration statements 
although we believe we can raise sufficient capital to meet our obligations through fiscal year  our ability to raise additional capital in the equity markets is dependent on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the market demand for our common stock 
the market demand or liquidity of our common stock is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to  negative economic conditions  adverse market conditions  adverse clinical trials results  and significant delays in one or more clinical trials 
if our ability to access the capital markets becomes severely restricted  it could have a negative impact on our business plans  including our clinical trial programs and other research and development activities 
in addition  even if we are able to raise additional capital  it may not be at a price or on terms that are favorable to us 
we may also raise additional capital through licensing our products in development  procuring new government contracts and grants  or increasing revenue from our wholly owned subsidiary  avid 
with respect to financing our operations through procuring government contracts and grants  on october   we were awarded an aggregate cash grant of approximately  under section d of the internal revenue code as reimbursement for four separate qualifying therapeutic discovery projects  which we applied for under the patient protection and affordable care act of while we will continue to explore these potential opportunities  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in procuring additional government contracts and grants  or that sufficient additional revenue will be generated from avid or under potential licensing or partnering agreements to complete the research  development  and clinical testing of our product candidates 
based on our current projections  which include projected revenues under signed contracts with existing customers of avid  and assuming we do not generate any additional revenues or raise any additional capital from the capital markets or other potential sources  we believe we have sufficient cash on hand combined with amounts expected to be received from avid customers to meet our obligations as they become due through at least the second quarter of our fiscal year ending october  there are a number of uncertainties associated with our financial projections  including but not limited to  termination of third party contracts  technical challenges  the rate at which patients are enrolled into any current or future clinical trials  of which  could reduce or delay our future projected cash flows 
in addition  in the event our projected cash inflows are reduced or delayed we might not have sufficient capital to operate our business through the second quarter of our fiscal year unless we raise additional capital 
the uncertainties surrounding our future cash inflows have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
significant components of the changes in cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities for the year ended april  compared to the prior year are as follows cash used in operating activities 
cash used in operating activities is primarily driven by changes in our net loss 
however  cash used in operating activities generally differs from our reported net loss as a result of non cash operating expenses or differences in the timing of cash flows as reflected in the changes in operating assets and liabilities 
during the year ended april   cash used in operating activities increased  to  compared to  for the year ended april  this increase in net cash used in operating activities was due to an increase of  in net loss reported during fiscal year after taking into consideration non cash operating expenses offset by a net change in operating assets and payment or reduction of liabilities in the aggregate amount of  the decrease in the net change in operating assets and payment or reduction of liabilities was primarily due to net changes associated with receivables  inventories  accounts payable  accrued liabilities  deferred revenue and deferred government contract revenue 
the increase in our fiscal year net loss was primarily due to a current year decreases in contract manufacturing revenue and government contract revenue combined with increases in research and development expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses  which were offset by a decrease in cost of contract manufacturing and an increase in interest and other income 
the changes in operating activities as a result of non cash operating expenses or differences in the timing of cash flows as reflected in the changes in operating assets and liabilities are as follows year ended april  net loss  as reported less non cash operating expenses depreciation and amortization   share based compensation   amortization of expenses paid in shares of common stock  amortization of discount on notes payable and debt issuance costs common stock issued for services  loss on disposal of property  net cash used in operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities net change in operating assets and liabilities net cash used in operating activities cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities increased  to  for the year ended april  compared to net cash used in investing activities of  during the year ended april  this increase was due to an increase in cash outflows of  associated with property acquisitions combined with an increase in cash outflows of  associated with an increase in other assets  which were offset by a  decrease in cash inflows associated with the sale of property 
the current year increase in property acquisitions was primarily related to purchases of certain computer software and hardware to enhance corporate infrastructure and operational efficiencies combined with the purchase of certain leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures associated with additional office space we leased in may the current year increase in other assets is primarily associated with an increase in deposits and or progress payments for certain additional computer software to enhance corporate infrastructure and operational efficiencies and additional leasehold improvements associated with office space we leased in may cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities increased  to  for the year ended april  compared to net cash provided of  for the year ended april  during fiscal year  we sold  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of  in addition  we received net proceeds of  and  from the exercise of stock options and purchases of shares under our employee stock purchase plan  respectively 
these current year net proceeds from financing activities were offset with principal payments on notes payable and capital leases of  and  respectively 
during fiscal year  we sold  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of  in addition  we received net proceeds of  from the exercise of stock options 
these fiscal year net proceeds from financing activities were offset with principal payments on notes payable and capital leases of  and  respectively 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments 
the following chart represents our contractual obligations as of april   aggregated by type payments due by period total year years years after years operating leases  net note payable obligation capital lease obligation other long term liabilities minimum license obligations total contractual obligations represents our i facility operating leases in tustin  california under two separate non cancelable lease agreements  ii facility operating lease in houston  texas  which has a three year lease term and expires in april  and iii various office equipment leases  which generally have three to five year lease terms 
amounts represent anticipated principal and interest payments on our security and loan agreement and a final payment fee of  which is due and payable on the maturity date pursuant to the loan agreement 
under the security and loan agreement  the outstanding principal balance each month will bear interest at a monthly variable rate equal to the then current thirty day libor rate set at a floor of plus 
anticipated interest payments were calculated using an interest rate of representing a libor floor rate of plus 
as of april   the thirty day libor rate was less than the minimum floor 
represents capital lease agreements to finance certain equipment 
amounts include principal and interest 
represents licensing agreements we periodically enter into with third parties to obtain exclusive or non exclusive licenses for certain technologies 
the terms of certain of these agreements require us to pay future milestone payments based on product development success 
we anticipate milestone payments not to exceed  during fiscal year under our existing licensing agreements 
in addition  milestone payments beyond fiscal year cannot be predicted due to the uncertainty of future clinical trial results and development milestones and therefore  cannot be reasonably predicted or estimated at the present time  including potential obligations in the amount of  that would become due and payable upon the first commercial approval of a drug candidate developed under our ps targeting program  including bavituximab

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in us interest rates would affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and interest expense on our outstanding notes payable  however  they would not have an effect on our capital leases  which have fixed interest rates and terms 
based on our overall cash and cash equivalents interest rate exposure at april   a near term change in interest rates  based on historical movements  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
at april   we had an outstanding notes payable balance of  under a loan and security agreement  which bear interest at a monthly variable rate equal to the then current thirty day libor rate set at a floor of plus  which may expose us to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
however  based on current libor interest rates  which are currently under the minimum floor set at under our loan and security agreement and based on historical movements in libor rates  we believe a near term change in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations
