table of contents we achieved a gross drilling success rate of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   we had rigs drilling on our properties and we had gross net wells in progress 
company owned drilling rigs we own three drilling rigs 
owning these rigs allows us to meet a portion of our drilling needs in uinta and the piceance 
two of these rigs are not currently drilling  and one rig is drilling in the uinta 
we continue to evaluate the ownership of these rigs as the rig market and our rig requirements change 
marketing and customers we market the majority of the natural gas and oil production from properties we operate for both our account and the account of the other working interest owners in these properties 
we sell our production to a variety of purchasers under oil and gas purchase contracts with daily  monthly  seasonal  annual or multi year terms  all at market prices 
the majority of our sales are to marketing companies or refiners 
we typically sell production to a relatively small number of customers 
however  based on the current demand for oil and natural gas and the availability of other purchasers  we believe that the loss of any one or all of our major purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or operating cash flows 
our oil production is collected in tanks and sold via pipeline or truck 
our oil contracts are priced either on local area oil postings or are based upon the nymex wti  with location or transportation differentials 
a substantial portion of our oil reserves are located in california  and approximately of our production is attributable to heavy crude generally degree api gravity crude oil or lower 
the market price for california crude differs from the established market indices in the us  due principally to the higher refining costs associated with heavy crude 
as of december   we have over of our california oil production under contract with shell trading us company and exxonmobil oil corporation through march and november  respectively 
the remaining california production is under contract through december with a niche refiner in the los angeles basin 
in utah  we are a party to a crude oil sales contract through june  with a refiner for the purchase of a minimum of  bbl d of uinta black wax crude oil 
pricing under the contract  which includes transportation and gravity adjustments  is at a fixed percentage of nymex wti 
while the contractual differentials under this contract may be less favorable at times than the posted differential  demand for our degree black wax light crude oil can vary seasonally and this contract provides a stable outlet for our crude oil 
due to the possibility of refinery constraints in the utah region  it is possible that the loss of our crude oil sales customer in utah could impact the marketability of a portion of our utah crude oil volumes 
gross oil production from our uinta properties averaged approximately  bbl d in our natural gas is transported through our own and third party gathering systems and pipelines 
we incur processing  gathering and transportation expenses to move our natural gas from the wellhead to a purchaser specified delivery point 
these expenses vary based on the volume and distance shipped and the fee charged by the third party processor or transporter 
in certain instances  we enter into firm transportation agreements to provide for pipeline capacity to flow and sell a portion of our gas volumes 
our rocky mountain natural gas production is tied to the eastern markets in lebanon  ohio  while our utah gas production is generally priced relative to a rocky mountain northwest pipeline nwpl or questar index price

table of contents in our producing areas  we have firm transportation contracts on interstate and intrastate pipelines to assure the delivery of our gas to market 
at the time we entered into these commitments  we estimated that our production and the production of joint interest owners that we market  would be sufficient to meet these commitments 
in california  we have firm transportation contracts to assure our ability to purchase a portion of our consumed gas outside of the california markets

the project is expected to be in service in mid steaming operations our california assets consist of heavy crude oil which requires heat  supplied in the form of steam  injected into the oil producing formations to reduce the oil viscosity  thereby allowing the oil to flow to the wellbore for production 
we utilize cyclic steam and or steam flood recovery methods on all assets 
cogeneration steam supply 
in pursuing our goal of being a cost efficient heavy oil producer in california  we have consistently focused on minimizing our steam cost 
we believe one of the main methods to keep steam costs low is through the ownership and efficient operation of three cogeneration facilities located on our properties 
two of these cogeneration facilities  a megawatt mw and an mw facility  are located in s 
midway 
we also own a mw cogeneration facility which is located in placerita 
cogeneration  also called combined heat and power chp  extracts energy from the exhaust of a turbine that would otherwise be wasted  to produce steam 
this increases the efficiency of the combined process and consumes less fuel than would be required to produce the steam and electricity separately 
conventional steam generation 
in addition to these cogeneration plants  we own fully permitted conventional steam generators 
the quantity of generators operated at any point in time is dependent on i the steam volume required for us to achieve our targeted production and ii the price of natural gas compared to the realized price of crude oil sold 
in  we added four additional steam generators for use in our ongoing development of the diatomite 
in  we added one additional  bspd generator at poso creek and three additional  bspd generators on our diatomite producing properties 

table of contents ownership of these varied steam generation facilities and sources allows for maximum operational control over the steam supply  location  and to some extent  over the aggregated cost of steam generation 
our steam supply and flexibility are crucial for the maximization of california thermally enhanced heavy oil production  cost control and ultimate oil recovery 
total barrels of steam per day bspd capacity as of december  are as follows steam generation capacity of conventional steam generators steam generation capacity of cogeneration plants additional steam purchased under contract with a third party total steam capacity the average gross volume of steam injected for the years ended december  and was  bspd and  bspd  respectively 
during december  approximately of the volume of natural gas purchased to generate steam and electricity was based upon california indices 
we pay distribution transportation charges for the delivery of gas to our various locations where we consume gas for steam generation purposes 
however  in some cases  this transportation cost is embedded in the price of gas 
approximately of supply volume is purchased in the rockies and moved to the midway sunset field using our firm transportation capacity on the kern river pipeline 
this gas is generally purchased based upon the nwpl index 
average socal border monthly index price per mmbtu average rocky mountain nwpl monthly index price per mmbtu average pg e citygate monthly index price per mmbtu we are a net seller of natural gas and benefit operationally when natural gas prices increase 
however  our consumption of natural gas provides a form of natural hedge as our revenues received from natural gas sales are partially offset by operating cost increases in california when natural gas prices rise 
the following table shows our average and estimated average amount of production in excess of consumption and hedged volumes in average mmbtu d estimated approximate natural gas volumes produced in operations approximate natural gas consumed cogeneration operations conventional steam generators total natural gas volumes consumed in operations less our estimate of approximate natural gas volumes consumed to produce electricity total approximate natural gas volumes consumed to produce steam natural gas volumes hedged amount of natural gas volumes produced in excess of volumes consumed to produce steam and volumes hedged we estimate this volume based on the historical allocation of fuel costs to electricity 

table of contents electricity generation 
the total annual average electrical generation of our three cogeneration facilities is approximately mw  of which we consume approximately mw for use in our operations 
each facility is centrally located on certain of our oil producing properties 
thus the steam generated by each facility is capable of being delivered to numerous wells that require steam for the eor process 
our investment in our cogeneration facilities has been for the express purpose of lowering the steam costs in our heavy oil operations and securing operating control of the respective steam generation 
expenses of operating the cogeneration plants are analyzed regularly to determine whether they are advantageous versus conventional steam generators 
cogeneration costs are allocated between electricity generation and oil and gas operations based on the conversion efficiency of fuel to electricity and steam of each cogeneration facility and certain direct costs to produce steam 
cogeneration costs allocated to electricity will vary based on  among other factors  the thermal efficiency of our cogeneration plants  the price of natural gas used for fuel in generating electricity and steam  and the terms of our power contracts 
although we account for cogeneration costs as described above  economically we view any profit or loss from the generation of electricity as a decrease or increase  respectively  to our total cost of producing heavy oil in california 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a related to our cogeneration facilities is allocated between electricity operations and oil and gas operations using a similar allocation method 
sales contracts 
we sell electricity produced by our cogeneration facilities to two california public utilities southern california edison company edison and pacific gas and electric company pg e  under long term contracts approved by the california public utilities commission cpuc 
these contracts are referred to as standard offer so contracts under which we are paid an energy payment that reflects the utility short run avoided cost srac of energy plus a capacity payment that reflects a recovery of capital expenditures that would otherwise have been made by the utility 
during most periods  natural gas is the marginal fuel for california utilities  so this formula provides a hedge against our cost of gas to produce electricity and steam in our cogeneration facilities 
on september   the cpuc issued a decision srac decision that changes the way srac energy prices will be determined for existing and new so contracts and revises the capacity prices paid under current so contracts 
the revised pricing ordered in the srac decision became effective on august  certain elements of the revised pricing have not been resolved in legal and regulatory proceedings 
it has not been determined whether the revised srac pricing will be applied retroactively  and if so  for what period 
all pending legal and regulatory challenges are being held in abeyance pending final effectiveness of a global settlement approved by the cpuc in december but still subject to certain conditions precedent global settlement 
we do not expect the prospective reduction in electricity revenue as a result of lower srac prices to be material to us 
in december  we executed a five year so contract with edison for the placerita unit facility  and five year so contracts with pg e for the cogen and cogen facilities  each effective january  our so contract with edison for the placerita unit facility expired on march  effective upon their scheduled terminations  each of the four contracts was extended pursuant to the srac decision 
on december   we executed agreements with pg e  which extend the electricity sales contracts for our mw and mw facilities until december  these contracts could also terminate earlier upon cpuc approval of replacement contracts  or under certain other limited circumstances 
our electricity sales contracts with edison for our placerita facility will continue in effect until the cpuc approves and makes available replacement so contracts  which  under the global settlement  will likely be sometime in  however  our current contracts could terminate earlier under certain limited circumstances 
the payment provisions of the extension agreements reflect the payment provisions ordered in the srac decision 
upon edison and pg e challenge in the california court of appeals of the legality of the cpuc decision that ordered the utilities to enter into these so contracts  the court ruled that the 
table of contents cpuc had the right to order the utilities to execute these contracts and that the cpuc was obligated to review the prices paid under the contracts and to adjust the prices retroactively to the extent it was later determined that such prices did not comply with certain requirements 
a cpuc proceeding to resolve this retroactive price issue is being held in abeyance pending the outcome of the global settlement 
we intend to enter into new so contracts with edison and pg e for all of these facilities as soon as the ongoing challenges are resolved and the cpuc has approved the terms of new so contracts

competition the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
as an independent producer  we have little control over the price we receive for our crude oil and natural gas 
as such  higher costs  fees and taxes assessed at the producer level cannot necessarily be passed on to our customers 
in acquisition activities  competition is intense as integrated and independent companies and individual producers are active bidders for desirable oil and gas properties and prospective acreage 
although many of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have  we are in a position to compete effectively due to our business strengths 
title to properties prior to the time we acquire undeveloped properties  we conduct a title investigation consistent with industry custom and practice 
most developed properties we acquire have existing title opinions 
in addition  prior to commencement of drilling operations we obtain a drilling title opinion which  in the event production is achieved  is supplemented with a division order title opinion or its equivalent 
to date  we have obtained or commissioned title opinions on virtually all of our producing properties and have satisfactory title to those properties in accordance with industry standards 
a majority of our oil and gas properties are subject to a mortgage or deed of trust under our second amended and restated senior secured revolving credit facility credit agreement  as well as to customary royalty interests  liens incidental to operating agreements  tax liens  and other minor burdens  encumbrances  easements and restrictions which do not materially interfere with the use of or affect the value of such properties 
employees as of december   we had full time employees 
we also contract for the services of independent consultants involved with land  regulatory  accounting  financial and other disciplines as needed 
none of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by a collective bargaining agreement

environmental and other regulations we are committed to responsible management of the environment and prudent health and safety policies  as these areas relate to our operations 
we strive to achieve the long term goal of sustainable development within the framework of sound environmental  health and safety practices and standards 
we strive to make environmental  health and safety protection an integral part of all business activities  from the acquisition and management of our resources to the decommissioning and reclamation of our wells and facilities 
we have programs in place to identify and manage known risks  to train employees in the proper performance of their duties and to incorporate viable new technologies into our operations 
the costs incurred to ensure compliance with environmental  health and safety laws and other regulations are normal operating expenses and are not material to our operating costs 
there can be no assurances  however  that changes in  or additions to  laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment will not have an impact in the future 
we maintain insurance coverage that is customary in the industry although we are not fully insured against all environmental or other risks 
environmental regulation 
our oil and gas exploration  production and related operations are subject to numerous and frequently changing federal  state  tribal and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
environmental laws and regulations may require the acquisition of certain permits prior to or in connection with activities or other operations  restrict or prohibit the types  quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment including releases in connection with drilling and production  restrict or prohibit drilling activities or other operations that could impact wetlands  endangered or threatened species or other protected areas or natural resources  require remedial action to mitigate pollution from ongoing or former operations  such as cleanup of environmental contamination  pit cleanups and plugging of abandoned wells  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations 
see item a risk factors we are subject to existing and pending laws and regulations that could give rise to substantial liabilities from environmental contamination or otherwise adversely affect our cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
regulation of oil and gas 
the oil and gas industry  including our operations  is extensively regulated by numerous federal  state and local authorities and  with respect to tribal lands  native american tribes 
these types of regulations include requiring permits for the drilling of wells  the posting of drilling bonds and the reports concerning operations 
regulations may also govern the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the rates of production or allowables  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells  and the notifying of surface owners and other third parties 
certain laws and regulations may 
table of contents limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 
we are also subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to native american tribal surface ownership  to native american oil and gas leases and other exploration agreements  fees  taxes  or other burdens  obligations and issues unique to oil and gas ownership and operations within native american reservations 
federal energy regulation 
the enactment of the public utilities regulatory policy act  purpa  as amended  and the adoption of regulations there under by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc provided incentives for the development of cogeneration facilities such as ours 
a domestic electricity generating project must be a qualifying facility qf under ferc regulations in order to benefit from certain rate and regulatory incentives provided by purpa 
purpa provides two primary benefits to qfs 
first  qfs generally are relieved of compliance with extensive federal and state regulations that control the financial structure of an electricity generating plant and the prices and terms on which electricity may be sold by the plant 
second  ferc regulations promulgated under purpa require that electric utilities purchase electricity generated by qfs at a price based on the purchasing utility avoided cost and that the utility sell back up power to the qf on a non discriminatory basis 
the term avoided cost is defined as the incremental cost to an electric utility of electric energy or capacity  or both  which  but for the purchase from qfs  such utility would generate for itself or purchase from another source 
the energy policy act of amended purpa to allow a utility to petition ferc to be relieved of its obligation to enter into any new contracts with qfs if ferc determines that a competitive wholesale electricity market is available to qfs in the service territory 
while such a determination has not been made for our service areas in california  as part of the global settlement  the utilities will be relieved from this obligation precedent to the global settlement 
under the global settlement  the utilities will be obligated to continue offering so contracts to qfs such as us 
this amendment does not affect any of our current so contracts 
state energy regulation 
the cpuc has broad authority to regulate both the rates charged by  and the financial activities of  electric utilities operating in california and to promulgate regulation for implementation of purpa 
since a power sales agreement becomes a part of a utility cost structure generally reflected in its retail rates  power sales agreements with independent electricity producers  such as us  are potentially under the regulatory purview of the cpuc and in particular the process by which the utility has entered into the power sales agreements 
while we are not subject to regulation by the cpuc  the cpuc implementation of purpa is important to us  as is other regulatory oversight provided by the cpuc to the electricity market in california 
item a 
risk factors other factors affecting our business and financial results oil and natural gas prices fluctuate widely  and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and operating cash flow 
our revenues  profitability and future growth and reserve calculations depend substantially on the price received for our oil and natural gas production 
these prices also affect the amount of our cash flow available for capital expenditures  working capital  payments on our various debt instruments  dividends paid on our capital stock and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically 
the oil and natural gas markets fluctuate widely  and we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices 
prices for oil and natural gas may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and 
table of contents demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control  such as regional  domestic and foreign supply and perceptions of supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  level of consumer demand  weather conditions  overall domestic and global political and economic conditions  technological advances affecting energy consumption and supply  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation  the impact of energy conservation efforts  the capacity  cost and availability of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities  and the price and availability of alternative fuels 
our revenue  profitability and cash flow depend upon the prices and demand for oil and natural gas  and a drop in prices can significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth 
in particular  declines in commodity prices will reduce the amount of cash flow available to make capital expenditures or make acquisitions  reduce the number of our drilling locations  increase the likelihood of refinery defaults  negatively impact the value of our reserves  because declines in oil and natural gas prices would reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically  and limit our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital 
our heavy crude oil in california may be less economic than lighter crude oil 
as of december   approximately of our proved reserves  or million barrels  consisted of heavy oil  and light crude oil represented of our proved reserves 
heavy crude oil historically sells for a discount to light crude oil  as more complex refining equipment is required to convert heavy oil into high value products 
additionally  most of our crude oil in california is produced using steam injection 
this process is generally more costly than primary and secondary recovery methods 
purchasers of our crude oil and natural gas may become insolvent 
we have significant concentrations of credit risk with the purchasers of our crude oil and natural gas 
for example  all of our crude oil in utah is sold under a long term contract to a single refiner 
under the standard credit terms with our refiners  we may not know that a refiner will be unable to make payment to us until days of our production has been delivered to them 
if our purchasers become insolvent  we may not be able to collect any of the amounts owed to us 
due to the possibility of refinery constraints in the utah region  it is possible that the loss of our crude oil sales customer in utah could impact the marketability of a portion of our utah crude oil volumes 
our financial counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations 
we rely on financial institutions to fund their obligations under our credit agreement and make payments to us under our hedging agreements 
if one or more of our financial counterparties becomes insolvent  they may not be able to meet their commitment to fund future borrowings under our credit facility which would reduce our liquidity 
additionally  at current commodity prices  a portion of our cash flow over the next three 
table of contents years will come from payments from our counterparties on our commodity hedging contracts 
if our counterparties are not able to make these payments  our cash flow will be reduced 
recently adopted financial reform legislation may require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity  which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty 
a widening of commodity differentials may adversely impact our revenues and our economics 
our crude oil and natural gas are priced in the local markets where the production occurs based on local or regional supply and demand factors 
the prices that we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production are generally lower than the relevant benchmark prices  such as nymex or brent  that are used for calculating commodity derivative positions 
the difference between the benchmark price and the price we receive is called a differential 
we may not be able to accurately predict crude oil and natural gas differentials 
price differentials may widen in the future 
numerous factors may influence local pricing  such as refinery capacity  pipeline takeaway capacity and specifications  localized storage capacity  upsets in the mid stream or downstream sectors of the industry  trade restrictions and governmental regulations 
we may be adversely impacted by a widening differential on the products we sell 
our oil and natural gas hedges are generally based on west texas intermediate wti or natural gas index prices  so we may be subject to basis risk if the differential on the products we sell widens from those benchmarks and we do not have a contract tied to those benchmarks 
additionally  regional capacity and storage issues may cause benchmark prices to become disconnected from other sources of global crude oil and natural gas which may adversely affect the effectiveness of our hedges that are based on such indices 
insufficient pipeline capacity  storage capacity or trucking capability and the lack of demand in any given operating area may cause the differential to widen in that area compared to other oil and natural gas producing areas 
increases in the differential between benchmark prices for oil and natural gas and the wellhead price we receive could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operation  and operating cash flows 
market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to crude oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
market conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
the availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors  including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities 
our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems  pipelines  processing facilities  trucking capability and refineries owned and operated by third parties 
our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 
we may be required to shut in wells for a lack of a market or because of inadequacy or unavailability of oil and natural gas pipelines  gathering system capacity  processing facilities or refineries 
if that were to occur  then we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until arrangements were made to deliver the production to market 
we may not be able to deliver minimum crude oil volumes required by our sales contract 
production volumes from our uinta properties over the next several years are uncertain and there is no assurance that we will be able to consistently meet the minimum required volume under our refining contract relating to our production from these properties 
during the term of the contract  the minimum number of delivered barrels is  boe d 
in the event that we cannot produce the necessary volume  we may need to purchase crude to meet our contract requirements 
gross oil production from our uinta properties averaged approximately  boe d during we may be subject to the risk of adding additional steam generation equipment if the electrical market deteriorates significantly 
we are dependent on several cogeneration facilities that  combined  provide approximately of our steam capacity as of december  these facilities are dependent on 
table of contents reasonable contracts for the sale of electricity 
if  for any reason  including if utilities that purchase electricity from us are no longer required by regulation to enter into electricity sales contracts with us  we were unable to enter into new or replacement contracts or were to lose any existing contract  we may not be able to supply of the steam requirements necessary to maximize production from our heavy oil assets 
an additional investment in various steam sources may be necessary to replace such steam  and there may be risks and delays in being able to install conventional steam equipment due to permitting requirements and availability of equipment 
the financial cost and timing of such new investment may adversely affect our production  capital outlays and cash provided by operating activities 
we executed agreements with pacific gas and electric company pg e  which extend the electricity sales contracts for our mw and mw facilities until december  these contracts could also terminate earlier upon cpuc approval of replacement contracts  or under certain other limited circumstances 
our electricity sales contracts with southern california edison company edison for our placerita facility will continue in effect until the cpuc approves and makes available replacement standard form qf contracts  which  under the pending global settlement  will likely be sometime in  however  our current contracts could terminate earlier under certain limited circumstances 
the future of the electricity market in california is uncertain 
we utilize cogeneration plants in california to generate lower cost steam compared to conventional steam generation methods 
electricity produced by our cogeneration plants is sold to utilities and the steam costs are allocated to our oil and natural gas operations 
we executed agreements with pg e  which extend the electricity sales contracts for our mw and mw facilities until december  these contracts could also terminate earlier upon cpuc approval of replacement contracts  or under certain other limited circumstances 
our electricity sales contracts with edison for our placerita facility will continue in effect until the cpuc approves and makes available replacement standard form qf contracts  which  under the pending global settlement  will likely be sometime in  however  our current contracts could terminate earlier under certain limited circumstances 
additionally  legal and regulatory decisions especially related to the pricing of electricity under the contracts such as the srac decision and the pending issues as to effective dates on retroactivity  can by reducing our electricity revenues adversely affect the economics of our cogeneration facilities and as a result the cost of steam for use in our oil and natural gas operations 
in addition  any final determination by the cpuc to apply the srac pricing formula  which became effective on august  retroactively  so as to require payment on a one time basis  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and operating cash flows 
during the california energy crisis in and  we had electricity sales contracts with pg e and edison  and a portion of the electricity prices paid to us under such contracts from december to march  has been under a degree of legal challenge since that time 
there are ongoing proceedings before the cpuc in which edison and pg e are seeking credit against future payments they are to make for electricity purchases based on retroactive adjustments to pricing under contracts with us 
it is possible that we may have a liability pending the final outcome of the cpuc proceedings on the matter 
whether or not retroactive adjustments will be ordered  how such adjustments would be calculated and what period they would cover are too uncertain to estimate at this time 
on december   the cpuc issued an order that approves a global settlement by and between the three california utilities  two consumer representative groups and three parties that represent the interests of the majority of the cogeneration facilities in the state  including us  which upon its effectiveness would extinguish all pending claims of retroactive payment liability  would make available long term standard form qf contracts and would prospectively revise srac pricing 
before this global settlement can become effective however  it must survive certain regulatory and or legal challenges  and the ferc must grant a forthcoming application by the california utilities to be relieved from the purpa obligation 
a shortage of natural gas in california could adversely affect our business 
we may be subject to the risks associated with a shortage of natural gas and or the transportation of natural gas into and within 
table of contents california 
we are highly dependent on sufficient volumes of natural gas necessary to use for fuel in generating steam in our heavy oil operations in california 
if the required volume of natural gas for use in our operations were to be unavailable or too highly priced to produce heavy oil economically  our production could be adversely impacted 
we have firm transportation to move  mmbtu d on the kern river pipeline from the rocky mountains to kern county  ca  which accounts for approximately one quarter of our current requirement 
our use of oil and natural gas price and interest rate derivative contracts involves credit risk and may limit future revenues from price increases or reduced expenses from lower interest rates  as well as result in significant fluctuations in net income and shareholders equity 
we use derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production with the objective of achieving a more predictable cash flow  and reducing our exposure to a significant decline in the price of crude oil and natural gas 
from time to time we utilize interest rate derivative contracts to fix the rate on a portion of our variable rate indebtedness  as only a portion of our total indebtedness has a fixed rate and we are therefore exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
while the use of derivative instruments limits the downside risk of price declines or rising interest rates  as applicable  their use may also limit future revenues from price increases or reduced expenses from lower interest rates  as applicable 
derivative transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations 
our future success depends on our ability to find  develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves 
to maintain production levels  we must locate and develop or acquire new oil and natural gas reserves to replace those depleted by production 
without successful exploration  exploitation or acquisition activities  our reserves  production and revenues will decline 
we may not be able to find  develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost 
in addition  substantial capital is required to replace and grow reserves 
if lower oil and natural gas prices or operating difficulties result in our cash flow from operations being less than expected or limit our ability to borrow under credit arrangements  we may be unable to expend the capital necessary to locate and to develop or acquire new oil and natural gas reserves 
actual quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and future cash flows from those reserves  future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures and operating expenses most likely will vary from estimates 
it is not possible to measure underground accumulations of oil or natural gas in an exact way 
estimating accumulations of oil and natural gas is a complex process that relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  such as oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds  some of which are mandated by the sec 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of quality and quantity of available data  interpretation of that data  and accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions 
any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of development  changes in development schedule and exploration and prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base both our estimated quantities of reserves and our estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on an un weighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month during the calendar year and on year end 
table of contents costs 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used in the estimate 
future commodity price declines and or increased capital costs may result in a write down of our asset carrying values  which could adversely affect our results of operations and limit our ability to borrow funds 
the value of our assets depend on crude oil and natural gas prices 
declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs  changes in well performance  delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves  and accounting rules may require us to write down  as a non cash charge to earnings  the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for impairments 
we capitalize costs to acquire  find and develop our oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts accounting method 
if net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties exceed fair value  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
we review the carrying value of our properties annually and at any time when events or circumstances indicate a review is necessary  based on estimated prices as of the end of the reporting period 
the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties is computed on a field by field basis 
once incurred  a write down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil or natural gas prices increase 
while we did not incur any such impairment charges in or  natural gas prices have decreased significantly below price levels at the time of the acquisition of our natural gas properties in and it is possible that further declines in commodity prices could prompt an impairment in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period incurred and on our ability to borrow funds under our credit agreement 
approximately of our total estimated proved reserves at december  were proved undeveloped reserves and may be reclassified as unproved or may not ultimately be produced or developed 
recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the reserve data included in the reserve engineer reports assumes that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves 
although cost and reserve estimates attributable to our crude oil and natural gas reserves have been prepared in accordance with industry standards  we cannot be sure that the estimated costs are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated 
the sec generally requires that reserves classified as proved undeveloped be capable of conversion into proved developed within five years of classification unless specific circumstances justify a longer time 
proved undeveloped reserves that are not timely developed are subject to possible reclassification as non proved reserves 
substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and operating cash flows 
in addition  our undeveloped reserves may not ultimately be developed or produced during the time periods we have planned  at the costs we have budgeted  or at all  which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
competitive industry conditions may negatively affect our ability to conduct operations 
competition in the oil and gas industry is intense  particularly with respect to the acquisition of producing properties and of proved undeveloped acreage 
major and independent oil and natural gas companies actively bid for desirable oil and natural gas properties  as well as for the equipment  supplies  labor and services required to operate and develop their properties 
some of these resources may be limited and have higher prices due to current strong demand 
many of our competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater than ours  which may adversely affect our ability to compete within the industry 
many of our larger competitors not only drill for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional  national or worldwide basis 
these companies may be able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties and evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial or human resources permit 
in addition  there is substantial competition for investment capital in the oil and natural gas industry 

table of contents these larger companies may have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low oil and natural gas prices and to absorb the burden of present and future federal  state  local and other laws and regulations 
our inability to compete effectively with larger companies could have a material adverse impact on our business activities  financial condition  results of operations  and operating cash flows drilling is a high risk activity 
our future success will partly depend on the success of our drilling program 
in addition to the numerous operating risks described in more detail below  these drilling activities involve the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be discovered 
also  we are often uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling  completing and producing wells 
furthermore  drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including obtaining government and tribal required permits  unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  changes in regulations  compliance with governmental or landowner requirements  and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment and or services  including experienced labor 
as a result  there can be no assurance that our anticipated production levels will be realized or that our estimates of proved reserves will not be negatively impacted 
for example  although we expect that our diatomite production will increase to  boe d by mid  actual production from these assets could be significantly lower 
during the first half of  diatomite production decreased primarily due to the inability to drill new wells pending the receipt of permits from the doggr 
although we have received such permits  the doggr is expected to issue new regulations for the development of diatomite  the effect of which we are unable to determine until such regulations are issued 
the oil and natural gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses 
the oil and gas business involves many operating risks  and insurance we maintain may not protect us against all of these risks 
these risks include fires  explosions  blow outs  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  formation water or drilling fluids  natural disasters  pipe or cement failures  casing collapses  embedded oilfield drilling and service tools  abnormally pressured formations  
table of contents major equipment failures  including cogeneration facilities  and environmental hazards such as oil spills  natural gas leaks  pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases 
if any of these events occur  we could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life  severe damage or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damage  investigatory and clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties  more stringent regulations applicable to our operations  suspension of operations  and repairs to resume operations 
if we experience any of these problems  our ability to conduct operations could be adversely affected 
if a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance  it could adversely affect us 
in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses in order to protect against the risks we face 
for instance  we do not carry business interruption insurance 
we may elect not to carry insurance if the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  we cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks 
the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and operating cash flows 
while we intend to obtain and maintain insurance coverage we deem appropriate for these risks  there can be no assurance that our operations will not expose us to liabilities exceeding such insurance coverage or to liabilities not covered by insurance 
we are subject to comprehensive and stringent existing and pending laws and regulations that could give rise to substantial liabilities from environmental contamination or otherwise adversely affect our cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
our operations are regulated extensively at the federal  state  regional and local levels by environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on our discharge of pollutants into the environment  establish standards for our management  treatment  storage  transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and solid and hazardous wastes  and impose obligations requiring us to investigate and remediate contamination resulting from our operations 
in certain circumstances  we also must satisfy federal and state requirements for providing environmental assessments  environmental impact studies and or plans of development before we commence exploration and production activities 
environmental requirements applicable to our operations generally have become more stringent in recent years  and compliance with those requirements has become more expensive 
frequently changing environmental laws and regulations have increased our costs to plan  design  drill  install  operate and abandon oil and natural gas wells and other facilities  and may impose substantial liabilities if we fail to comply with such regulations or for any contamination resulting from our operations 
our business results from operations and financial condition  results of operations  and operating cash flows may be adversely affected by any failure to comply with  or future changes to  these laws and regulations 
in particular  failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal sanctions  including the payment of monetary penalties and the performance of remedial obligations 

table of contents from time to time we have experienced accidental spills  leaks and other discharges of contaminants at our properties 
we could be liable for the investigation or remediation of such contamination  as well as claims for personal injury  property damage or natural resource damage arising from the contamination 
we have incurred expenses and penalties in connection with contamination arising from our operations in the past  and we may do so in the future 
such liabilities may arise at many locations  including properties in which we have an ownership interest but no operational control  properties we formerly owned or operated and sites where our wastes have been treated or disposed of  as well as at properties that we currently own or operate  and may arise because of our status as an owner or operator and not because of any noncompliance with applicable environmental laws 
under a number of environmental laws  including the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  such liabilities may be joint and several  meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of the liability involved  or even the entire share 
some of the properties that we have acquired  or in which we may hold an interest but not operational control  may have past or ongoing contamination for which we may be held responsible 
some of our operations are in environmentally sensitive areas that may provide habitat for endangered or threatened species  and other protected areas  and our operations in such areas must satisfy additional regulatory requirements 
moreover  public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years  and environmental organizations have opposed certain drilling projects and or access to prospective lands and have filed litigation in an attempt to overturn decisions granting the performance of such projects  including decisions made by the us bureau of land management regarding several leases in utah that we have been awarded 
climate change legislation or regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our operations  our cost structure  and the demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce 
on december   the us environmental protection agency epa published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane  and other greenhouse gases ghgs present an endangerment to public heath and the environment because emissions of such gasses are  according to the epa  contributing to the warming of the earth atmosphere and other climate changes 
following issuance of this finding  the epa adopted two sets of regulations under the clean air act 
the first limits emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles beginning with the model year 
the epa has asserted that these final motor vehicle ghg emission standards trigger clean air act construction and operating permit requirements for stationary sources 
on june   the epa published its final rule to address the permitting of ghg emissions from stationary sources under the prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v permitting programs 
this rule tailors these permitting programs to apply to certain stationary sources of ghg emissions in a multi step process  with the largest sources first subject to permitting 
it is widely expected that facilities required to obtain psd permits for their ghg emissions also will be required to reduce those emissions according to best available control technology standards for ghg that have yet to be developed 
with regard to the monitoring and reporting of ghgs  on december   the epa amended the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule reporting rule  originally issued in september the reporting rule establishes a new comprehensive scheme requiring operators of stationary sources emitting more than established annual thresholds of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gases to inventory and report their greenhouse gases emissions annually on a facility by facility basis 
further  on november   epa finalized new ghg reporting requirements for upstream petroleum and natural gas systems  which will be added to epa ghg reporting rule 
facilities containing petroleum and natural gas systems that emit  metric tons or more of co equivalent per year will now be required to report annual ghg emissions to epa  with the first report due on march  similarly  legislation has been introduced in the united states congress that would establish measures restricting greenhouse gas emissions in the united states 
at the state level  over one half of the states  including california  have begun taking actions to control and or reduce emissions of ghgs 
the state of california has adopted legislation that caps california ghg emissions at levels by 
table of contents  and the california air resources board carb has implemented mandatory reporting regulations and is proceeding with early action measures to reduce ghg emissions prior to january  carb is also developing regulations to implement a cap and trade program in to reduce ghg emissions 
the adoption of any legislation or regulations that requires reporting of ghgs or otherwise limits emissions of ghgs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur increased operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 
federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays 
congress has  in the past  considered two companion bills for the fracturing responsibility and awareness of chemicals act the frac act 
while now dead  if reintroduced  the bills would repeal an exemption in the federal safe drinking water act swda for the underground injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids near drinking water sources 
hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate natural gas production 
sponsors of the frac act have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies  and the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities 
if reintroduced  the legislation would require the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process 
the availability of this information could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater 
further  if enacted  the frac act could result in additional regulatory burdens such as permitting  construction  financial assurance  monitoring  recordkeeping  and plugging and abandonment requirements 
in addition  various state and local governments are considering increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements  operational restrictions  and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain environmentally sensitive areas such as watersheds 
the adoption of any future federal or state laws or implementing regulation imposing reporting obligations on  or otherwise limiting  the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing  complete natural gas wells in shale formations and increase our costs of compliance and doing business 
our operations are subject to numerous federal  state and tribal regulations and laws  compliance with existing and future laws may increase our costs and delay our operations 
our activities are also subject to regulation by the federal government  oil and natural gas producing states and one native american tribe 
these regulations affect our operations and limit the quantity of oil and natural gas we may produce and sell 
a major risk inherent in our drilling plans is the need to obtain drilling permits from federal  state  local and native american tribal authorities 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or drilling permits  the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well  or the receipt of a permit with unreasonable conditions that are more expensive than we have anticipated could have a negative effect on our ability to explore or develop our properties 
changes to current tax laws may affect our ability to take certain deductions 
substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that  if adopted  would affect  among other things  our ability to take certain deductions related to our operations  including depletion deductions  deductions for intangible drilling and development costs and deductions for united states production activities 
these changes  if enacted into law  could negatively affect our financial condition  results of operations and operating cash flow 

table of contents derivatives legislation enacted in could have an adverse impact on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price  interest rate and other risks associated with our business 
new comprehensive financial reform legislation was signed into law by the president on july  the legislation calls for the commodities futures trading commission the cftc to regulate certain markets for over the counter otc derivative products 
currently  final rules to be adopted by the cftc implementing the mandates of the new legislation are pending 
such rules would require certain derivatives to clear through clearinghouses 
the effect on our business will depend in part on whether we are determined to be a major swap participant or swap dealer or a qualifying end user  as those terms are defined in the final rules 
we may be required to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade execution requirements in connection with our derivative activities 
the cftc has proposed regulations that  if adopted  may exempt us from margin and clearing requirements  but the timing of adoption of such regulations  and their scope  is uncertain 
even if we are not deemed a major swap participant or swap dealer  the rules could impose burdens on market participants to such an extent that liquidity in the bilateral otc derivative market decreases substantially 
the legislation may also require counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities  which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties 
the legislation and any new regulations  including determinations with respect to the applicability of margin requirements and other trading structures  could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts  materially alter the terms of derivative contracts  reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter  reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts  and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties 
if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations  our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable  which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures 
our revenues could be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices 
any of these consequences could have a material  adverse effect on us  our financial condition  and our results of operations 
property acquisitions are a component of our growth strategy  and our failure to complete future acquisitions successfully could reduce our earnings and slow our growth 
our business strategy has emphasized growth through strategic acquisitions  but we may not be able to continue to identify properties for acquisition or we may not be able to make acquisitions on terms that we consider economically acceptable 
there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry 
competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of  or cause us to refrain from  completing acquisitions 
our strategy of completing acquisitions is dependent upon  among other things  our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and  in some cases  regulatory approvals 
if we are unable to achieve strategic acquisitions  our growth may be impaired  thus impacting earnings  cash from operations and reserves 
acquisitions are subject to the uncertainties of evaluating recoverable reserves and potential liabilities 
our recent growth is due in part to acquisitions of properties with additional development potential and properties with minimal production at acquisition but significant growth potential  and we expect acquisitions will continue to contribute to our future growth 
successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include recoverable reserves  exploration potential  future oil and natural gas prices  operating costs  production taxes  access rights and potential environmental and other liabilities 
such assessments are inexact  and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
in connection with our assessments  we perform a review of the acquired properties  which we believe is generally consistent with industry practices 
however  such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems 
in addition  our review may not allow us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties  and we do not always discover structural  subsurface  environmental and access problems that may exist or arise 
our review prior to signing a definitive purchase agreement may be even more limited 

table of contents we generally are not entitled to contractual indemnification for pre closing liabilities  including environmental liabilities  on acquisitions 
often  we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties 
if material breaches are discovered by us prior to closing  we could require adjustments to the purchase price or if the claims are significant  we or the seller may have a right to terminate the agreement 
we could also fail to discover breaches or defects prior to closing and incur significant unknown liabilities  including environmental liabilities  or experience losses due to title defects  for which we would have limited or no contractual remedies or insurance coverage 
there are risks in making acquisitions  including difficulties in integrating acquired properties into our business  additional liabilities and expenses associated with acquired properties  diversion of management attention  and costs of increased scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
increasing our reserve base through acquisitions is an important part of our business strategy 
any acquisition involves potential risks  including  among other things the validity of our assumptions about reserves  future production  the future prices of oil and natural gas  revenues and costs  including synergies  an inability to integrate successfully the properties and businesses we acquire  a decrease in our liquidity to the extent we use a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions  a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur debt to finance acquisitions  the assumption of unknown liabilities  losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate  the diversion of management attention from other business concerns  an inability to hire  train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing business and assets  unforeseen difficulties encountered in operating in new geographic areas  and customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses 
our decision to acquire a property or business will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies  geophysical and geological analyses and seismic and other information  the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations 
if third party pipelines interconnected to our natural gas wells and gathering facilities become partially or fully unavailable to transport our natural gas  our financial condition  results of operations and operating cash flows could be adversely affected 
we depend upon third party pipelines that provide delivery options from our wells and gathering facilities 
since we do not own or operate these pipelines  their continuing operation in their current manner is not within our control 
if any of these third party pipelines become partially or fully unavailable to transport our natural gas  or if the natural gas quality specifications for their pipelines change so as to restrict our ability to deliver natural gas to those pipelines  our revenues and cash available for distribution could be adversely affected 
a change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal  state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets  which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase 
section b of the natural gas act nga exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the ferc as a natural gas company under the nga 
we believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional 
table of contents tests ferc has used to establish a pipeline status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company  but the status of these lines has never been challenged before ferc 
the distinction between ferc regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is subject to change based on future determinations by ferc  the courts  or congress  and application of existing ferc policies to individual factual circumstances 
accordingly  the classification and regulation of some of our natural gas gathering facilities may be subject to challenge before ferc or subject to change based on future determinations by ferc  the courts  or congress 
in the event our gathering facilities are reclassified to ferc regulated transmission services  we may be required to charge lower rates and our revenues could thereby be reduced 
should we fail to comply with all applicable ferc administered statutes  rules  regulations and orders  we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines 
ferc has issued an order requiring certain participants in the natural gas market  including natural gas gatherers and marketers  which engage in a minimum level of natural gas sales or purchases to submit annual reports regarding those transactions to ferc 
in addition  ferc has issued an order requiring major non interstate pipelines  defined as certain non interstate pipelines delivering  on an annual basis  more than an average of million mmbtu of gas over the previous three calendar years  to post daily certain information regarding the pipeline capacity and scheduled flows for each receipt and delivery point that has design capacity equal to or greater than  mmbtu per day 
should we fail to comply with these requirements or any other applicable ferc administered statute  rule  regulation or order  we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines 
under the energy policy act of  ferc has civil penalty authority under the nga to impose penalties for current violations of up to million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 
we depend to a large extent on the efforts and continued employment of our executive management team and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of these or other key personnel could adversely affect our business  and we do not maintain key man insurance on the lives of any of these persons 
our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists  engineers  landmen and other professionals 
competition for many of these professionals is intense 
if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel and professionals  our ability to compete could be harmed 
we may not adhere to our proposed drilling schedule 
our final determination of whether to drill any scheduled or budgeted wells will depend on a number of factors  including results of our exploration efforts and the acquisition  review and analysis of our seismic data  if any  availability of sufficient capital resources to us and any other participants for the drilling of the prospects  approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiled  economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling  including prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas and the availability and prices of drilling rigs and crews  and availability of leases  license options  farm outs  other rights to explore and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects 
although we have identified or budgeted for numerous drilling prospects  we may not be able to lease or drill those prospects within our expected time frame  or at all 
for instance  our drilling schedule may vary from our expectations because of future uncertainties and rig availability and access to our drilling locations utilizing available roads 
in addition  we will not necessarily drill wells on all of our identified drilling locations on our acreage 

table of contents we may incur losses as a result of title deficiencies 
we acquire from third parties  or directly from the mineral fee owners  working and revenue interests in the oil and natural gas leaseholds and estates upon which we will perform our exploration activities 
the existence of a material title deficiency can reduce the value or render a property worthless  thus adversely affecting our financial condition  results of operations and operating cash flow 
title insurance covering mineral leaseholds is not always available  and when available is not always obtained 
as is customary in our industry  we rely upon the judgment of staff and independent landmen who perform the field work of examining records in the appropriate governmental offices and abstract facilities before attempting to acquire or place under lease a specific mineral interest and or undertake drilling activities 
we  in some cases  perform curative work to correct deficiencies in the marketability of the title to us 
in cases involving material title problems  the amount paid for affected oil and natural gas leases or estates can be generally lost  and a prospect can become undrillable 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties information required by item properties is included under item business 
item legal proceedings while we are  from time to time  a party to certain lawsuits in the ordinary course of business  we do not believe any of such existing lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition  or operating cash flows
