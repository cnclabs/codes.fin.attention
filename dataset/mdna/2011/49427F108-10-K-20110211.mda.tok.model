item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources of the operating partnership 
market risk as of december   approximately of our total outstanding debt of billion was subject to variable interest rates 
the remaining bore interest at fixed rates 
all of our interest rate sensitive financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading purposes 
in general  interest rate fluctuations applied to our variable rate debt will impact our future earnings and cash flows 
conversely  interest rate fluctuations applied to our fixed rate debt will generally not impact our future earnings and cash flows  unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated and need to be refinanced 
however  interest rate fluctuations will impact the fair value of the fixed rate debt instruments 
with the exception of the exchangeable notes and our publicly traded unsecured senior notes  we generally determine the fair value of our fixed rate debt by performing discounted cash flow analyses using an appropriate market rate 
we calculate the market rate by obtaining period end treasury rates for maturities that correspond to the maturities of our fixed rate debt and then adding an appropriate credit spread based on information obtained from third party financial institutions 
these credit spreads take into account factors  including but not limited to  our credit profile  the tenure of the debt  amortization period  whether the debt is secured or unsecured  and the loan to value ratio of the debt 
we determine the fair value of the liability component of our exchangeable notes by performing discounted cash flow analysis using an appropriate market interest rate for similar non convertible conventional debt instruments 
we determine the fair value of each of our publicly traded unsecured senior notes based on their quoted trading price at the end of the reporting period 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities as of december  and as of december   the total outstanding balance of our variable rate debt included borrowings on our credit facility of million and was indexed to libor plus a spread of weighted average interest rate was 
as of december   the total outstanding balance of our variable rate debt included borrowings of million on our prior credit facility  which was indexed to libor plus a spread of  and borrowings of million on our secured line of credit  which was indexed to libor plus a spread of weighted average interest rate was 
assuming no changes in the outstanding balance of our existing variable rate debt as of december   a basis point increase in the libor rate would increase our projected annual interest expense  before the effect of capitalization  by approximately million 
comparatively  if interest rates were basis points higher as of december   our projected annual interest expense  before the effect of capitalization  would have been million higher 
the total carrying value of our fixed rate debt  including our exchangeable notes  was approximately billion and million as of december  and  respectively 
the total estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt was approximately billion and million as of december  and  respectively 
for sensitivity purposes  a basis point increase in the discount rate equates to a decrease in the total fair value of our fixed rate debt of approximately million  or  as of december  comparatively  a basis point increase in the discount rate equates to a decrease in the total fair value of our fixed rate debt of approximately million  or  as of december  the above sensitivity analyses do not consider interrelationships between different market movements  which could result in additional changes in the fair value of our debt and exchangeable notes  beyond the amounts calculated
