item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and consolidated results of operations  included elsewhere in this form k 

table of contents during the past several years  we supported our internal growth strategy with our presence in markets with higher than average population growth 
we believe our presence in these markets positions us to experience growth at rates that are generally higher than those of declining population growth 
we continue to focus on enhancing stockholder value by implementing our operating and financial strategies 
to ensure that our goals relative to these strategies are achieved  we have developed and implemented incentive programs that help focus our entire company on realizing key performance metrics  including increasing free cash flow  achieving targeted earnings  maintaining and improving returns on invested capital  and maintaining the integration synergies we have achieved 
our operating and financial strategies are described further herein 
operating strategy we seek to leverage existing assets and revenue growth to increase operating margins and enhance stockholder value 
our operating strategy for accomplishing this goal includes the following using the extensive industry knowledge and experience of our executive management team  using a decentralized management structure in overseeing day to day operations  using our strong  integrated operating platform  and implementing major initiatives aimed at improving the quality of our service and our operating margins 
experienced executive management team we believe that we have one of the most experienced executive management teams in the solid waste industry

walbridge has over years of experience in the solid waste industry 
michael p 
rissman has served as our executive vice president  general counsel and corporate secretary since august previously  mr 
rissman had served as acting general counsel and corporate secretary 
table of contents from march mr 
rissman joined allied as vice president and deputy general counsel in july and continued in the same positions at republic following the allied acquisition in december prior to joining allied  mr 
rissman was a partner at mayer  brown  rowe maw  llp  in chicago  where he worked from until coming to allied in our regional senior vice presidents have an average of years of experience in the industry 
decentralized management structure we rely on a decentralized management structure to minimize administrative overhead costs and to more efficiently manage our day to day operations 
our local management has extensive industry experience in growing  operating and managing solid waste companies and has substantial experience in their local geographic markets  allowing us to quickly respond to and meet our customers needs and stay in touch with local businesses and municipalities 
each regional management team includes a senior vice president  vice president controller  vice president of human resources  vice president of sales  vice president of operations support  director of safety  director of engineering and environmental management  and director of market planning and development 
we believe that our strong regional management teams allow us to more effectively and efficiently drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout the organization 
our regional management teams and area presidents have extensive authority  responsibility and autonomy for operations within their respective geographic markets 
compensation for area management teams is primarily based on improving operating income  free cash flow and return on invested capital generated in each manager s geographic area of responsibility 
in addition  through long term incentive programs  including stock options  we believe we have achieved one of the lowest turnover levels in the industry for our local management teams 
as a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local communities  we are proactive in anticipating customers needs and adjusting to changes in our markets 
we also seek to implement the best practices of our various regions and areas throughout our operations to continue improving operating margins 
strong  integrated operating platform we believe that with the allied acquisition we have created a company with a strong  national operating platform 
most previous attempts to consolidate the waste industry focused on a roll up strategy often involving relatively young companies solely focused on increasing revenue through acquisitions 
we believe that the combination of republic s and allied s mature and proven business practices has been a critical component of our success and has driven the realization of approximately million in annual run rate synergies since completion of the acquisition 
during  we will continue to monitor the synergies we believe we have achieved and we will implement additional initiatives aimed at further improving operating margins 
separate from acquisition related integration activities  we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling waste streams from the point of collection through disposal 
our fully integrated markets generally have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our non integrated markets 
through acquisitions  landfill operating agreements and other market development activities  we create market specific  integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection companies  transfer stations and landfills 
we consider acquiring companies that own or operate landfills with significant permitted disposal capacity and appropriate levels of waste volumes 
we also seek to acquire solid waste collection companies in markets in which we own or operate landfills 
in addition  we generate internal growth in our disposal operations by developing new landfills and expanding our existing landfills from time to time in markets in which we have significant collection operations or in markets that we determine lack sufficient disposal capacity 
during the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of the total waste volume that we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate internalization 
this increase in internalization from to is due to a higher concentration of integrated hauling and landfill operations acquired in the allied acquisition 
in a number of our larger markets  we and our competitors are required to take waste to government controlled disposal facilities flow control 
this provides us with an opportunity to effectively 
table of contents compete in these markets without investing in landfill capacity 
by further integrating operations in existing markets  we may be able to reduce our disposal costs 
we continue to invest in integrating and expanding our information systems and technology platform 
our platform consists of the best of the legacy systems from both republic and allied 
during  we converted the entire company to a single payable and general ledger system 
during  we converted to a single operating system and we transitioned the entire company to a single payroll and human resource system 
our future technology related initiatives will include customer relationship management  billing  productivity and maintenance systems 
we believe that the combination of these systems will prove to be a competitive advantage for our company 
major initiatives during  we believe we completed the most successful integration and consolidation of two major companies in the waste industry 
the integration process allowed us to select the best tools and systems and to adopt the best practices of these two successful companies 
during  we will continue or begin to implement the following major initiatives aimed at improving profitability safety 
safety remains our highest priority for all of our employees and the communities we serve 
our long standing commitment to safety is unwavering and is evident in our mission statement 
we will continue to improve the driver safety training program and reward our people for operating in a safe and conscientious manner in all our lines of business 
customer experience 
we strive to provide the highest level of customer service 
our policy is to periodically visit each commercial account to ensure customer service and satisfaction 
in addition to visiting existing customers  a salesperson develops a base of prospective customers within each market 
we also have municipal marketing representatives that are responsible for working with each municipality or community to which we provide residential service to ensure customer satisfaction 
additionally  the municipal representatives organize and drive the effort to obtain new or renew municipal contracts in their service areas 
we will continue to reinvest in our existing fleet of vehicles  equipment  landfills and other facilities to ensure the highest level of service to our customers and the communities we serve 
in addition  we continue to focus on innovative waste disposal processes and programs to help our customers achieve their goals related to sustainability and environmentally sound waste practices 
we believe that these in turn will help us achieve profitable growth 
during  we will continue to exceed our customers expectations through the consistent delivery of high quality service and an expanded use of technology to make it easier to do business with us 
our technology eventually will allow more customers to access information and perform functions like change service requests and make payments over the internet that were previously done with the assistance of a customer service representative 
by increasing the ease of use and functionality of our web based market presence  we believe we will enhance customer satisfaction and retention while we lower our costs 
economies of scale  cost efficiencies and asset utilization 
we continue to identify and implement best practices throughout our organization with the goal of permanently improving overall operating and financial results 
these best practice initiatives focus on critical areas of our operations such as landfill operations  truck routing  recycling  maintenance and related service efficiencies  purchasing and administrative activities 
the consolidation of acquired businesses into existing operations reduces costs by decreasing capital and expenses used for truck routing  personnel  equipment and vehicle maintenance  inventories and back office administration 
generally  we consolidate our acquired administrative centers to reduce our general and administrative costs 
our goal is to maintain our selling  general and administrative costs at no more than of revenue  which we believe is appropriate given our existing business platform 

table of contents in addition  our procurement initiatives ensure that we negotiate volume discounts for goods and services purchased 
further  we have taken steps to maximize the utilization of our assets 
for example  to reduce the number of collection vehicles and maximize the efficiency of our fleet and drivers  we use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and improve operating density 
additionally  in we will continue to convert certain of our residential routes to single driver side load service  thereby increasing employee safety and increasing route efficiency and service times 
we continue to invest in our material recovery facilities by converting certain facilities from dual to single stream sorting and by updating our technology and equipment  all resulting in higher levels of productivity and recovered materials from a more efficient collection and recovery process 
by using assets more efficiently  operating expenses can be reduced 
targeted profitable growth 
our growth strategy focuses on increasing revenue  gaining market share and enhancing stockholder value through internal growth in price and volume as well as acquisitions 
our internal growth strategy focuses on retaining existing customers and obtaining new commercial  municipal and industrial customers through our well managed sales and marketing activities 
price growth 
we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs  to improve our operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills 
volume growth 
growth through increases in our customer base and services provided is the most capital efficient means for us to build our business 
we seek to obtain long term contracts for collecting solid waste in markets with growing populations 
these include exclusive franchise agreements with municipalities as well as commercial and industrial contracts 
by obtaining such long term agreements  we have the opportunity to grow our contracted revenue base at the same rate as the underlying population growth in these markets 
we believe it is important to have secured exclusive  long term franchise agreements in growing market areas 
we believe that this positions us to experience internal growth rates that are generally higher than our industry s overall growth rate 
in addition  we believe that by securing a base of long term recurring revenue in growing population markets  we are better able to protect our market position from competition and our business may be less susceptible to downturns in economic conditions 
volume growth includes not only expanding landfill and transfer station capacity and investing in trucks and containers  but also includes investing in information tools and training needed to ensure high productivity and quality service throughout all functional areas of our business 
we work to increase collection and disposal volumes while ensuring that prices charged for such services provide an appropriate return on our capital investment 
sales and marketing activities 
we seek to manage our sales and marketing activities to enable us to capitalize on our leading position in many of the markets in which we operate 
we provide a national accounts program in response to the needs of our national clients  centralizing services to effectively manage their needs  such as minimizing their procurement costs 
we currently have approximately  sales and marketing employees in the field who are compensated using a commission structure that is focused on generating high levels of quality revenue 
generally  these employees directly solicit business from existing and new business from prospective commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
in training sales personnel we emphasize increased price and cost structures as well as the use of a customer relationship management system that assists in tracking sales opportunities 
it also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial  industrial and franchise contracts 
we believe our national accounts program offers an opportunity for sales growth over the next several years 
development activities 
we seek to identify opportunities to further our position as an integrated service provider in markets where we are not fully integrated 
where appropriate  we seek to obtain permits to build transfer stations  recycling facilities  and landfills that would provide vertically integrated waste services or expand the service areas for our existing disposal sites 
development projects  while generally less capital intensive than acquisitions  typically require extensive permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no assurance of success 
we undertake development 
table of contents projects when we believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available 
acquisition growth 
our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on privately held solid waste and recycling companies and the waste and recycling operations of municipal and other local governmental authorities that complement our existing business platform 
we believe our ability to acquire privately held companies is enhanced by increasing competition in the solid waste industry  increasing capital requirements due to changes in solid waste regulatory requirements  and the limited number of exit strategies for privately held companies 
we also seek to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities that are privatizing  as they seek to raise capital and reduce risk 
in addition  we will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire operations and facilities that are being divested by other publicly owned waste companies 
our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on the following acquiring privately held businesses that position us for growth  acquiring well managed companies and  when appropriate  retaining local management  and acquiring operations and facilities from municipalities that are privatizing and from publicly owned companies that are divesting of assets 
in addition  we have and may continue to exchange businesses with other solid waste companies if by doing so there is a net benefit to our business platform 
these activities allow us to increase revenue and market share  lower our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue  and consolidate duplicative facilities and functions to maximize cost efficiencies and economies of scale 
durability 
we believe our decentralized management structure provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to quickly respond to and meet customer s needs and to stay in touch with local businesses and municipalities 
however  functions such as fleet maintenance and customer service are areas where we believe we can continue to build durable  consistent processes across all operating divisions 
through standardization of core functions  we believe we can minimize variability in our maintenance facilities resulting in a safer fleet of vehicles and lower costs 
by automating the collection process  we believe we can improve safety  increase productivity and reduce labor costs  thereby increasing operating margins 
for certain risks related to our operating strategy  see item a 
risk factors 
financial strategy key components of our financial strategy include generating and growing free cash flow and sustaining or improving our return on invested capital 
our definition of free cash flow  which is not a measure determined in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  is cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment  plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe that free cash flow is a driver of stockholder value and provides useful information regarding the recurring cash provided by our operations 
free cash flow also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy  which includes reinvesting in capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service  investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided  maintaining our investment grade credit ratings and reducing debt  paying cash dividends  repurchasing our stock  and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization 
free cash flow is also a key metric used to determine management s compensation 
we manage our free cash flow by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital  which consists primarily of accounts receivable and accounts payable 

table of contents we have used and will continue to use our cash flow to maximize stockholder value as well as our return on invested capital 
our financial strategy includes market growth and optimization within our markets  our goal is to deliver sustainable  long term profitable growth while efficiently operating our assets to generate acceptable rates of return 
we allocate capital to businesses  markets and development projects to support growth in order to achieve acceptable rates of return 
we develop previously non permitted  non contiguous landfill sites greenfield landfill sites 
we also expand our existing landfill sites  when possible 
we supplement this organic growth with acquisitions of operating assets  such as landfills  transfer stations  material recovery facilities and tuck in acquisitions of collection and disposal operations in existing markets 
we continuously evaluate our existing operating assets and their deployment within each market to determine if we have optimized our position and to ensure appropriate investment of capital 
where operations are not generating acceptable returns  we examine opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies and returns through the integration of additional assets 
if such enhancements are not possible  we may ultimately decide to divest the existing assets and reallocate resources to other markets 
enhancing stockholder value dividends 
in july  our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend of per share 
our quarterly dividend has increased from time to time thereafter  the latest increase occurring in the third quarter of to per share  representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends and may consider additional increases of our quarterly cash dividend if we believe it will enhance stockholder value 
share repurchase 
in november  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to million of our outstanding shares of common stock 
as of december   we used million under the program to repurchase million shares at an average cost per share of 
we expect to use the remaining funds in this program to repurchase shares during we intend to execute our financial strategy while still maintaining flexibility to take advantage of market growth opportunities and still maintaining our investment grade credit ratings 
capital structure debt 
following our december  allied acquisition  we initiated a debt reduction program which  to date  has resulted in a net reduction in borrowings of billion funded by cash flow from operations and proceeds from disposition of assets 
we also refinanced billion in senior notes and million in tax exempt financings which reduced the average coupon rate on our senior notes and tax exempt financings  on a weighted average basis  by more than basis points while extending our debt maturities and thereby giving greater stability to our capital structure 
we anticipate taking further advantage of capital market opportunities to mitigate our financial risk by issuing new debt in and using the proceeds to repay existing debt 
any early extinguishment of debt may result in a charge in the period in which the debt is repurchased and retired 
credit ratings 
we believe that a key component of our financial strategy includes maintaining investment grade ratings on our senior debt  which was rated bbb by standard poor s  bbb by fitch and baa by moody s as of december  such ratings have allowed us  and should continue to allow us  to readily access capital markets at competitive rates 
our cash utilization strategy will continue to focus on maintaining our investment grade credit ratings 
for certain risks related to our financial strategy  see item a 
risk factors 
operations our operations primarily consist of the collection  transfer and disposal of non hazardous solid waste 

table of contents collection services 
we provide solid waste collection services to commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers through collection companies 
in  of our revenue was derived from collection services 
within the collection line of business  of our revenue is from services provided to municipal and residential customers  is from services provided to commercial customers  and is from services provided to industrial and other customers 
our residential collection operations involve the curbside collection of refuse from small containers into collection vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills 
residential solid waste collection services are typically performed under contracts with municipalities  which we generally secure by competitive bid and which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in the respective municipalities 
these contracts or franchises usually range in duration from one to five years  although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods 
residential solid waste collection services may also be performed on a subscription basis  in which individual households contract directly with us 
the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on market factors  frequency and type of service  the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal 
in general  subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the residential customers receiving the service 
in our commercial and industrial collection operations  we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes 
we also rent compactors to large waste generators 
commercial collection services are generally performed under one to three year service agreements  and fees are determined by considerations such as market factors  collection frequency  type of equipment furnished  the type and volume or weight of the waste collected  transportation costs  the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal 
we also provide waste collection services to industrial and construction facilities on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer 
our construction services are provided to the commercial construction and home building sectors 
we collect the containers or compacted waste and transport the waste either to a landfill or a transfer station for disposal 
we also provide recycling services in certain markets 
these services include the curbside collection of residential recyclable waste and the provision of a variety of recycling services to commercial and industrial customers 
transfer and disposal services 
we own or operate transfer stations 
we deposit waste at these transfer stations  as do other private haulers and municipal haulers  for compaction and transfer to trailers for transport to disposal sites or recycling facilities 
in  transfer and disposal services accounted for of our revenue 
as of december   we owned or operated active landfills  which had approximately  permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of approximately billion in place cubic yards 
the in place capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors  requirements of regulatory authorities  our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations  and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites 
some of our landfills accept non hazardous special waste  including utility ash  asbestos and contaminated soils 
most of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage 
we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices  market needs  remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion 
to satisfy future disposal demand  we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain of our landfills 
however  we cannot assure you that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed 
we also have responsibility for closed landfills  for which we have associated closure and post closure obligations 

table of contents landfill gas and renewable energy projects 
during  we brought two new landfill gas to energy lfgte projects on line  resulting in a total of active lfgte projects 
these projects consist of the following electric plants fueled by landfill gas  medium british thermal unit btu plants providing landfill gas to industrial users to be burned as fuel  six high btu plants that provide pipeline quality natural gas that ultimately could be used to fuel our natural gas fleet  and two projects that burn landfill gas to evaporate leachate 
the beneficial use of landfill gas provides our economy and environment with significant benefits  including the use and destruction of methane  a potent greenhouse gas  which reduces air pollution  and the use of landfill gas offsets the use of fossil fuels  thus reducing our dependence on foreign oil and use of our natural resources 
our generating projects produce megawatts of electricity annually  which is enough power to supply the electric needs of  homes 
our other lfgte projects process and produce  cubic feet per minute of landfill gas annually  which provides an energy benefit equivalent to heating  homes 
the environmental benefit of all of our projects removes the equivalent of  tons of methane emissions and  tons of carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere 
this is equivalent to removing the emissions of approximately million cars from our highways 
one of the two new projects  a medium btu use project at our newton county landfill  received the usepa project of the year award 
in  we also began the design and construction of new projects at nine landfills  which is comprised of seven electric plants  one medium btu plant and one high btu plant 
the high btu project  announced in the fall of  will feature an industry first process of producing high btu pipeline quality gas and using that gas to provide equivalent renewable compressed natural gas cng to a portion of our expanding fleet of cng refuse vehicles 
recycling facilities and other services 
we own or operate materials recovery facilities and other recycling operations 
these facilities sort recyclable paper  aluminum  glass and other materials 
most of these recyclable materials are internally collected by our residential collection operations 
in some areas  we receive commercial and industrial solid waste that is sorted at our facilities into recyclable materials and non recyclable waste 
the recyclable materials are salvaged  repackaged and sold to third parties  and the non recyclable waste is disposed of at landfills or incinerators 
sales and marketing we seek to provide quality services that will enable us to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction 
our business is derived from a broad customer base  which we believe will enable us to experience stable growth 
we focus our marketing efforts on continuing and expanding our business with existing customers  as well as attracting new customers 
we employ approximately  sales and marketing employees with a sales and marketing strategy of providing high quality  comprehensive solid waste collection  recycling  transfer and disposal services to our customers at competitive prices 
we target customers of all sizes  from small quantity generators to large fortune companies and municipalities 
while most of our marketing activity is local in nature  we also provide a national accounts program in response to the needs of national and regional customers 
this national accounts program is designed to provide the best total solution to our customers evolving waste management needs in an environmentally responsible manner 
we partner with national clients to reach their sustainability goals  optimize waste streams  
table of contents balance equipment and service intervals  and provide customized reporting 
the national accounts program centralizes services to effectively manage customer needs  while helping minimize procurement costs 
with our extended geographic reach  this program effectively serves our customers nationwide 
as industry leaders  our mission is to utilize our strengths and expertise to exceed customer expectations by consistently delivering the best national program available 
historically we have not always changed the trade names of the local businesses we acquired  and therefore we do not operate nationally under any one mark or trade name 
the majority of our operations  however  are branded under either republic  allied or bfi 
customers we provide services to a broad base of commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
no single customer has individually accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 
competition we operate in a highly competitive industry 
however  entry into our business and the ability to operate profitably require substantial amounts of capital and managerial experience 
competition in the non hazardous solid waste industry comes from a few other large  national publicly owned companies  including waste management  inc  several regional publicly and privately owned solid waste companies  and thousands of small privately owned companies 
in any given market  competitors may have larger operations and greater resources 
in addition to national and regional firms and numerous local companies  we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations 
these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and tax exempt financing 
we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services 
from time to time  our competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract 
our ability to maintain and increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by the pricing policies of our competitors 
this may have an impact on our future revenue and profitability 
seasonality and severe weather our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather  which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation  delay the collection and disposal of waste  reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites  or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities 
our operations also can be favorably affected by severe weather  which could increase the volume of waste in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services 
regulation our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal  state and local requirements that regulate the environment  public health  safety  zoning and land use 
operating and other permits  licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations  certain solid waste collection vehicles  fuel storage tanks and other facilities that we own or operate 
these permits are subject to denial  revocation  modification and renewal in certain circumstances 
federal  state and local laws and regulations vary  but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges  air emissions  the handling  transportation  treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous and non hazardous waste  and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances 
these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement  which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits  obtain injunctions  or impose fines or penalties in the event of violations  including 
table of contents criminal penalties 
the us environmental protection agency epa and various other federal  state and local authorities administer these regulations 
we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws  regulations and permits 
however  in the existing climate of heightened environmental concerns  from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities 
we cannot assure you that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our regulatory compliance efforts 
we have established final capping  closure  post closure and remediation reserves that we believe  based on currently available information  will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs 
however  we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves 
refer to the contractual obligations table within item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained elsewhere herein for further information 
federal regulation 
the following summarizes the primary federal environmental and occupational health and safety related statutes that affect our facilities and operations the solid waste disposal act  including the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
rcra establishes a framework for regulating the handling  transportation  treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous and non hazardous solid waste  and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste in sanitary landfills 
subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste 
regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines  including location restrictions  facility design and operating criteria  final capping  closure and post closure requirements  financial assurance standards  groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards 
all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d 
these state permit programs may include landfill requirements which are more stringent than those of subtitle d 
our failure to comply with the implementation of federal environmental requirements by state and local authorities at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit  which would result in costs in connection with securing new permits and reduced revenue from lost operational time 
all of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements 
operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations 
compliance with subtitle d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla 
cercla  among other things  provides for the cleanup of sites from which there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
cercla may impose strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleanup and for damages to natural resources upon current owners and operators of a site  parties who were owners or operators of a site at the time the hazardous substances were disposed of  parties who transported the hazardous substances to a site  and parties who arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at a site 
under the authority of cercla and its implementing regulations  detailed requirements apply to the manner and degree of investigation and remediation of facilities and sites where hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment 
liability under cercla is not dependent on the existence or disposal of only hazardous wastes  but also can be based upon the existence of small quantities of more than substances  characterized by the epa as hazardous many of which are found in common household waste 
among other things  cercla authorizes the federal government to investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment or to order persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so themselves 
in addition  the 
table of contents epa has established a national priorities list of sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released and which require investigation or cleanup 
cercla liability is strict liability 
it can be founded upon the release or threatened release  even as a result of unintentional  non negligent or lawful action  of hazardous substances  including very small quantities of such substances 
thus  even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous waste  it is likely that hazardous substances have been deposited or released at landfills or other facilities that we presently or historically have owned or operated  or at properties owned by third parties to which we have transported waste 
therefore  we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources  even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them 
the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive and can include the costs of disposing remediation wastes at appropriately licensed facilities 
given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability  such liability could have a material impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the federal water pollution control act of the clean water act 
this act regulates the discharge of pollutants from a variety of sources  including solid waste disposal sites  into streams  rivers and other waters of the united states 
runoff from our landfills and transfer stations that is discharged into surface waters through discrete conveyances must be covered by discharge permits that generally require us to conduct sampling and monitoring  and  under certain circumstances  to reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges 
storm water discharge regulations under the clean water act require a permit for certain construction activities and for runoff from industrial operations and facilities  which may affect our operations 
if a landfill or transfer station discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly owned treatment works  the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by that treatment works 
in addition  states may adopt groundwater protection programs under the clean water act or the safe drinking water act that could affect the manner in which our solid waste landfills monitor and control their waste management activities 
furthermore  in the event that development at any of our facilities alters or affects wetlands  we may be required to secure permits prior to such development commencing 
in these situations  permitting agencies may require mitigation of wetland impacts 
the clean air act 
the clean air act imposes limitations on emissions from various sources  including landfills 
in march  the epa promulgated regulations that require large municipal solid waste landfills to install landfill gas monitoring systems 
these regulations apply to landfills that commenced construction  reconstruction or modification on or after may   and  principally  to landfills that can accommodate million cubic meters or more of municipal solid waste 
the regulations apply whether the landfill is active or closed 
the date by which each affected landfill is required to have a gas collection and control system installed and made operational varies depending on calculated emission rates at the landfill 
efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effect of climate change may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls and monitoring systems  with resulting capital or operating costs 
in addition  our vehicle fleet may also become subject to higher efficiency standards or other carbon emission restrictions 
see item a 
risk factors regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations  the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate 
many state regulatory agencies also currently require monitoring systems for the collection and control of certain landfill gas 
certain of these state agencies are also implementing greenhouse gas control regulations that would also apply to landfill gas emissions 
the occupational safety and health act of osha 
osha authorizes the occupational safety and health administration of the us department of labor to promulgate occupational safety and health standards 
a number of these standards  including standards for notices of hazardous chemicals and the handling of asbestos  apply to our facilities and operations 
state and local regulation 
each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal  water and air pollution  and  in most cases  releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters 
states also have adopted regulations governing the design  operation  maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations 
some counties  municipalities and other local governments have 
table of contents adopted similar laws and regulations 
our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements 
in addition  our operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring the development of solid waste reduction and recycling programs 
for example  several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce  through solid waste planning  composting  recycling or other programs  the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills 
additionally  laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills  including yard waste  newspapers  beverage containers  unshredded tires  lead acid batteries  electronic wastes and household appliances  have been promulgated in several states and are being considered in others 
legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also have been or are under consideration by the us congress and the epa 
to construct  operate and expand a landfill  we must obtain one or more construction or operating permits  as well as zoning and land use approvals 
these permits and approvals may be burdensome to obtain and to comply with  are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens groups  may be subject to periodic renewal  and are subject to denial  modification  non renewal and revocation by the issuing agency 
significant compliance disclosure obligations often accompany these processes 
in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills  we may be required to expend considerable time  effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 
other regulations 
many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to store petroleum based products 
these tanks are generally subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing  upgrading  closure and removal 
in the event of leaks or releases from these tanks  these regulations require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated 
we believe that all of our underground storage tanks meet all applicable regulations 
if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak  we could be liable for response costs and  if the leakage migrates onto the property of others  we could be liable for damages to third parties 
we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
with regard to our solid waste transportation operations  we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration  office of motor carriers  and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters 
various state and local government authorities have enacted or promulgated  or are considering enacting or promulgating  laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state  county  or other jurisdiction lines 
in  the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of out of state solid waste is unconstitutional  however  states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling 
in  the supreme court ruled that a flow control law  which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation  imposes an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce  and  therefore  is unconstitutional 
in  the supreme court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publicly owned and publicly operated waste facility 
a number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries 
other governments may enact similar regulations in the future 
these regulations may  in some cases  cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal  thereby adversely affecting our operations 
liabilities established for landfill and environmental costs 
we have established reserves for landfill and environmental costs  which include landfill site final capping  closure and post closure costs 
we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra  and we adjust our rates used to expense final capping  closure and post closure costs accordingly 
based on current information and regulatory requirements  we believe that our recorded reserves for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate 
however  environmental laws may change  and we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations  future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations  or adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us 

table of contents liability insurance and bonding the nature of our business exposes us to the risk of liabilities arising out of our operations  including possible damages to the environment 
such potential liabilities could involve  for example  claims for remediation costs  personal injury  property damage and damage to the environment in cases where we may be held responsible for the escape of harmful materials  claims of employees  customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations  or claims alleging negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work 
we could also be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements 
because of the nature and scope of the possible environmental damages  liabilities imposed in environmental litigation can be significant 
our solid waste operations have third party environmental liability insurance with limits in excess of those required by permit regulations  subject to certain limitations and exclusions 
however  we cannot assure you that such environmental liability insurance would be adequate  in scope or amount  in the event of a major loss  nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry excess environmental liability insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage costs prohibitive 
we have general liability  vehicle liability  employment practices liability  pollution liability  directors and officers liability  workers compensation and employer s liability coverage  as well as umbrella liability policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in these primary policies 
we also carry property insurance 
although we try to operate safely and prudently and we have  subject to limitations and exclusions  substantial liability insurance  we cannot assure you that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our insurance programs for workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability  and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured 
claims in excess of self insurance levels are insured subject to the excess policy limits and exclusions 
accruals are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported 
due to the variable condition of the insurance market  we have experienced  and may experience in the future  increased self insurance retention levels and increased premiums 
as we assume more risk for self insurance through higher retention levels  we may experience more variability in our self insurance reserves and expense 
in the normal course of business  we post performance bonds  insurance policies  letters of credit  or cash or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts  closure and post closure of landfills  environmental remediation  environmental permits  and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance 
to date  we have satisfied financial responsibility requirements by making cash or marketable securities deposits or by obtaining bank letters of credit  insurance policies or surety bonds 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  full time employees  approximately of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
from time to time  our operating locations may experience union organizing efforts 
we have not historically experienced any significant work stoppages 
we currently have no disputes or bargaining circumstances that we believe could cause significant disruptions in our business 
our management believes that we have good relations with our employees

except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation  we undertake no obligation to update or publish revised forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this form k or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
we have substantial indebtedness  which may limit our financial flexibility 
as of december   we had approximately billion in principal value of debt and capital leases outstanding 
this amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business  to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases  to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry  and to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants of our debt instruments 
further  our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in our debt instruments may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control 
if we do not comply with these covenants and restrictions  we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures  reducing dividends or stock repurchases  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt  or seeking additional equity capital 
the downturn in the us economy may continue to have an adverse impact on our operating results 
a weak economy generally results in decreases in the volumes of waste generated 
in  weakness in the us economy had a negative effect on our revenue  operating results and operating cash flows 
the current and previous economic slowdowns have negatively impacted the portion of our collection business servicing the manufacturing and construction industries 
as a result of the global economic crisis  we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure and customer turnover as well 
we cannot assure you that worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
furthermore  recovery in solid waste volumes historically has lagged behind recovery in the general economy and we cannot assure you that an improvement in general economic conditions will result in an immediate  or any  improvement in our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents the downturn in the us economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental agencies  large national accounts and others 
the weak us economy has reduced the amount of taxes collected by various governmental agencies 
we provide services to a number of these agencies including numerous municipalities 
these governmental agencies may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us 
in addition  the weak economy may cause other customers  including our large national accounts  to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us 
this could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the downturn in the us economy and in the financial markets could expose us to counter party risk associated with our derivatives 
to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in various commodities and interest rates  we have entered into a number of derivative agreements 
these derivative agreements require us or the counter party to such agreements to make payments to the other party if the price of certain commodities or interest rates vary from a specified amount 
although we only enter these agreements with investment grade rated financial institutions  a continued downturn in the us economy or in the financial markets could adversely impact the financial stability of the counter parties with which we do business  potentially limiting their ability to fulfill their obligations under our derivative agreements 
this could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the waste industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources  flexibility to reduce prices and other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively 
we principally compete with large national waste management companies  numerous municipalities  and numerous regional and local companies for collection and disposal accounts 
competition for collection accounts is primarily based on price and the quality of services 
competition for disposal business is primarily based on disposal costs  geographic location and quality of operations 
one of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we do 
further  many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue or tax exempt financing 
our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills may also be limited by the fact that some major collection companies also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste 
in markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill  our collection operations may operate at a disadvantage to fully integrated competitors 
as a result of these factors  from time to time we may have difficulty competing effectively in certain markets 
if we were to lower prices to address these competitive issues  it could negatively impact our revenues and profitability 
price increases may not be adequate to offset the impact of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume 
we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset higher costs including fuel and environmental costs  to maintain or improve operating margins  and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills 
from time to time  our competitors may reduce their prices in an effort to expand their market share 
contractual  general economic or market specific conditions also may limit our ability to raise prices 
for example  many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index 
particularly in a weak us economy such as the current one  our costs may increase in excess of the increase  if any  in the consumer price index 
this may continue to be the case even when the us economy recovers because a recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind a recovery in the general economy 
as a result  we may be unable to offset increases in costs  improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases 
we may also lose volume to lower cost competitors 

table of contents increases in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals will increase our operating expenses  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to recover fuel or oil cost increases from our customers 
we depend on fuel purchased in the open market to operate our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection  transfer  and disposal 
fuel prices are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control  including geopolitical developments  actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other oil and gas producers  supply and demand for oil and gas  war  terrorism and unrest in oil producing countries  and regional production patterns 
due to contractual or market factors  we may not be able to offset such volatility through fuel surcharges 
for example  our fuel costs were million in  representing of our revenue compared to million in  representing of our revenue 
to manage our exposure to volatility in fuel prices  we have entered into multiple swap agreements whereby we receive or make payments to counter parties should the price of fuel vary from a specified amount 
during  approximately of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements 
additionally  we are able to collect fuel recovery fees from some customers 
for  we were able to recover approximately of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees 
over the last several years  regulations have been adopted mandating changes in the composition of fuels for motor vehicles 
in november  epa finalized its renewable fuel standard for  which mandates increasing volumes of renewable fuels and biofuels to be used in motor vehicles driven in the us these regulations will likely affect the type of fuel our motor vehicle fleet uses and in the near term increase the cost of that fuel 
our operations also require the use of products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals 
an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products  which would increase our operating and capital costs 
we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel surcharges from our vendors 
fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we process recyclable materials such as paper  cardboard  plastics  aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties 
our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials 
the resale and purchase prices of  and market demand for  recyclable materials can be volatile due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control 
these fluctuations may affect our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have in the past  and may in the future  enter into swap agreements whereby we receive or make payments to counter parties if the price of commodities varies from a specified amount or range 
adverse weather conditions may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection and disposal 
our collection and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather  or by increased severity of weather and climate extremes resulting in the future from climate change  any of which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation  interfere with collection and landfill operations  delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers 
in addition  adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations  which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods 
we currently have matters pending with the internal revenue service the irs  which could result in large cash expenditures and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cash flows 
during its examination of allied s tax year  the irs asserted that a redemption of four partnership interests in waste to energy businesses should have been recharacterized as disguised sale transactions 
this issue is currently before the appeals division of the irs 
the company believes its position is supported by relevant technical authorities and strong business purpose and we intend to vigorously defend our position on 
table of contents this matter 
the potential tax and interest through december  to the extent unpaid have been fully reserved in our consolidated balance sheet 
a disallowance would not materially affect our consolidated results of operations  however  a deficiency payment would adversely impact our cash flow in the period the payment was made 
the accrual of additional interest charges through the time this matter is resolved will affect our consolidated results of operations 
in addition  the successful assertion by the irs of penalty and penalty related interest in connection with this matter could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  during its examination of allied s through tax years  the irs proposed that certain landfill costs be allocated to the collection and control of methane gas that is naturally emitted from landfills 
the irs position is that the methane gas emitted by a landfill constitutes a joint product resulting from landfill operations and  therefore  associated costs should not be expensed until the methane gas is sold or otherwise disposed 
we believe we have several meritorious defenses  including the fact that methane gas is not actively produced for sale by us but rather arises naturally in the context of providing disposal services 
therefore  we believe that the resolution of this issue will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
for additional information on these matters  see note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
we may be unable to execute our financial strategy 
our ability to execute our financial strategy depends on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior debt 
the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future 
our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected should we fail to maintain investment grade ratings 
our financial strategy is also dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business  fund internal growth  acquire other solid waste businesses  pay dividends  repurchase stock  reduce indebtedness and minimize borrowings  and take other actions to enhance stockholder value 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in executing our broad based pricing program  we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy  we will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate  we will be able to increase the amount of such dividends  or we will be able to continue our share repurchase program 
a downgrade in our bond ratings could adversely affect our liquidity by increasing the cost of debt and financial assurance instruments 
while downgrades of our bond ratings may not have an immediate impact on our cost of debt or liquidity  they may impact our cost of debt and liquidity over the near to medium term 
if the rating agencies downgrade our debt  this may increase the interest rate we must pay to issue new debt  and it may even make it prohibitively expensive for us to issue new debt 
if our debt ratings are downgraded  future access to financial assurance markets at a reasonable cost  or at all  also may be adversely impacted 
the solid waste industry is a capital intensive industry and the amount we spend on capital expenditures may exceed current expectations  which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 
our ability to remain competitive and to grow and expand our operations largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital 
if our capital efficiency programs are unable to offset the impact of inflation and business growth  it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend 
additionally  if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations  the amount we expend on capital  capping  closure  post closure and environmental remediation expenditures will increase 
our cash needs also will increase if the expenditures for capping  closure  post closure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates  which may 
table of contents occur over a long period due to changes in federal  state or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control 
increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows 
over the last several years  regulations have been adopted mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions 
in may  the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa finalized the first us standards for ghg emissions from conventional automobiles  including large pick up trucks 
these regulations include increased fuel economy requirements and apply to new motor vehicles covering model years through we do not expect that this final rule will lead to a material increase in our capital costs 
later in the epa and the nhtsa proposed rules expanding the scope of ghg emission standards for motor vehicles to include heavy duty vehicles  including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers 
these rules would similarly include increased fuel economy standards for such vehicles and would apply to new heavy duty motor vehicles covering model years through because the rule is still in the proposal stage  we cannot predict its effect on us but it could increase our capital costs 
this also could cause an increase in vehicle operating costs or a reduction in operating efficiency 
we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills  which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully obtain or maintain the permits we require to operate our business because permits to operate non hazardous solid waste landfills and to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain 
permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning  environmental and other regulations 
these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures 
local communities and citizen groups  adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need  allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject  or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage 
responding to these challenges has  at times  increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities 
in addition  failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities 
our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our non hazardous solid waste landfills could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our other landfills  either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs 
the waste industry is subject to extensive government regulation  and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations  increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 
if we inadequately accrue for landfill capping  closure and post closure costs  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
a landfill must be closed and capped  and post closure maintenance commenced  once the permitted capacity of the landfill is reached and additional capacity is not authorized 
we have significant financial obligations relating to capping  closure and post closure costs at our existing owned or operated landfills  and will have material financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated landfills 
we establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping  closure and post closure financial obligations 
we could underestimate such accruals  and our financial obligations for capping  closure or post closure costs could exceed the amount accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose 
such a shortfall could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 
additionally  if a landfill is required to be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason  the accruals for capping  closure and post closure could be required to be accelerated  which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents we cannot assure you that we will continue to operate our landfills at current volumes due to the use of alternatives to landfill disposal caused by state requirements or voluntary initiatives 
most of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning  composting and recycling  or other programs 
some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes  such as yard waste  at landfills 
although such actions are useful in protecting our environment  these actions  as well as voluntary private initiatives by customers to reduce waste or seek disposal alternatives  have reduced and will in the future reduce the volume of waste going to landfills 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to the decrease in demand for such services 
the possibility of landfill and transfer station site development projects  expansion projects or pending acquisitions not being completed or certain other events could result in a material charge to income 
we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development  expansion and other projects 
if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired  or a development or expansion project is not completed or is determined to be impaired  we will charge any unamortized capitalized expenditures to income relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale  transfer or otherwise 
in future periods  we may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy  or other events may cause impairments 
such charges could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to costly environmental regulations and flow control regulations that may affect our operating margins  restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability 
complying with laws and regulations governing the use  treatment  storage  transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials  air quality  water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly 
laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations 
in addition  environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping  closure and post closure  and environmental and remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 
our collection  transfer  and landfill operations are  and may in the future continue to be  affected by state or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state  county or other jurisdictional lines or that direct the flow of waste to a specified facility 
such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations  resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal 
in addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations  we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations  or who assert claims alleging environmental damage  personal injury or property damage 
as a result  we may be required to pay fines or implement corrective measures  or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked 
a significant judgment against us  the loss of a significant permit or license  or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with our environmental obligations 
we could underestimate such accruals and remediation costs could exceed amounts accrued 
such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 

table of contents regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations  the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate 
efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases ghgs and to ameliorate the effects of climate change continue to be debated on the federal  regional  and state level 
our landfill operations emit methane  identified as a ghg  and our vehicle fleets emit  among others  carbon dioxide  which has also been identified as a ghg 
conventional wisdom now suggests that passage of comprehensive  federal climate change legislation is highly unlikely 
nonetheless  should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted  we expect it to impose costs on our operations  the materiality of which we cannot predict 
absent comprehensive federal legislation to control ghg emissions  epa is moving ahead administratively under its existing clean air act authority 
in october  epa published a proposed prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule psd tailoring rule 
epa finalized the psd tailoring rule on may  the finalized psd tailoring rule establishes new thresholds for ghg emissions that define when clean air act permits would be required and would tailor these programs to limit which facilities would be required to obtain permits 
epa s legal authority to tailor this rule has been challenged 
as of january   some of our landfills became subject to the psd tailoring rule  which requires permit amendments and could require additional emission controls for ghgs when modifications are made to these landfills  which could increase our costs 
on october   epa and the department of transportation s national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa  proposed rules to reduce ghg emissions from medium and heavy duty vehicles 
these proposed rules  if finalized  would impose higher fuel economy standards of heavy duty vehicles 
as such  the proposed rules could require us to expend additional capital on our vehicle fleet 
in addition to the obligations imposed by the psd tailoring rule  as a result of epa finding that six ghgs endanger public health in december epa may impose additional ghg emissions controls on stationary sources 
while epa made its finding in the context of regulating air emissions from motor vehicles  now that it has made the endangerment finding  other provisions of the clean air act provide epa with the authority to impose further regulations upon stationary sources of ghg emissions  including landfills 
we cannot predict the requirements or effective date of any additional stationary source rules that might apply to landfills as a result of the endangerment finding and  accordingly  we cannot assure you that further developments in this area will not have a material effect on our landfill operations or on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we may have potential environmental liabilities that are not covered by our insurance 
changes in insurance markets also may impact our financial results 
we may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the environment as a result of our operations 
we maintain high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage 
if we were to incur substantial liability for environmental damage  our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability 
this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
also  due to the variable condition of the insurance market  we may experience future increases in self insurance levels as a result of increased retention levels and increased premiums 
as we assume more risk for self insurance through higher retention levels  we may experience more variability in our self insurance reserves and expense 
despite our efforts  we may incur additional hazardous substances liability in excess of amounts presently known and accrued 
we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under cercla  which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict  joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a hazardous substance 
cercla liability also extends to parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances were disposed  and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility ie  
table of contents generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site 
hundreds of substances are defined as hazardous under cercla and their presence  even in minute amounts  can result in substantial liability 
notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable regulations and to avoid transporting and receiving hazardous substances  we may have additional liability under cercla  or similar state laws or rcra  in excess of our current reserves because such substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills  or in waste collected  transported or disposed of in the past by companies we have acquired 
actual costs for these liabilities could be significantly greater than amounts presently accrued for these purposes  which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences  including judgments or settlements 
we are  and from time to time become  involved in lawsuits  regulatory inquiries  and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business 
many of these matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities 
the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits  regulatory inquiries  and governmental and other legal proceedings is uncertain 
additionally  the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements  either of which could require substantial payments  adversely affecting our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 
our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial  operational and management resources 
to continue our growth  we may need to add administrative and other personnel  and will need to make additional investments in operations and systems 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel  or do so on a timely basis  or expand our operations and systems to the extent  and in the time  required 
we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 
our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates as well as our ability to successfully consolidate acquired operations into our business 
the consolidation of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management 
in addition  competition among our competitors for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates 
as such  we cannot assure you that desirable acquisition candidates exist or will be identified  we will be able to acquire any of the candidates identified  we will effectively consolidate companies we acquire  or any acquisitions will be profitable or accretive to our earnings 
if any of the aforementioned factors force us to alter our growth strategy  our growth prospects could be adversely affected 
businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 
in pursuing our acquisition strategy  our due diligence investigations of the acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities of the acquisition candidates 
if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities such as environmental  remediation or contractual  as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities 
we expect to try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by conducting due diligence  by obtaining indemnification from each of the sellers of the acquired companies  by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnification or that any 
table of contents indemnification obtained will be enforceable  collectible or sufficient in amount  scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 
our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions made by management 
actual results could differ from these amounts 
significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain include the carrying value of long lived assets  the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs  accruals for final capping  closure and post closure costs  valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets  liabilities for potential litigation  claims and assessments  and liabilities for environmental remediation  employee benefit and pension plans  deferred taxes  uncertain tax positions and self insurance 
we cannot assure you that the liabilities recorded for landfill and environmental costs will be adequate to cover the requirements of existing environmental regulations  future changes to or interpretations of existing regulations  or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to management 
the introduction of new accounting rules  laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations 
complying with new accounting rules  laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations in future periods 
we may be subject to workforce influences  including work stoppages  which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 
as of december   approximately of our workforce was represented by various local labor unions 
if our unionized workers were to engage in strikes  work stoppages or other slowdowns  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs  which could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and  if successful  the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating costs 
if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized  our business and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs 
our obligation to fund multi employer pension plans to which we contribute may have an adverse impact on us 
we contribute to at least multi employer pension plans covering at least of our current employees 
we do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans 
the pension protection act enacted in the ppa requires under funded pension plans to improve their funding ratios 
based on the information available to us  we believe that some of the multi employer plans to which we contribute are either critical or endangered as those terms are defined in the ppa 
we cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding  if any  we may be required to make to these plans and  therefore  have not recorded any related liabilities 
however  plan assessments could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period 
furthermore  under current law  upon the termination of a multi employer pension plan  or in the event of a withdrawal by us which we consider from time to time or a mass withdrawal of contributing employers each  a withdrawal event  we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities 
we cannot assure you that there will not be a withdrawal event with respect to any of the multi employer pension plans to which we contribute or that  in the event of such a withdrawal event  the amounts we would be 
table of contents required to contribute would not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and fluctuating actuarial assumptions  and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan which is funded with trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities 
our costs for providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of plan assets 
our pension expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial calculations and assumptions  which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  interest rates and other factors 
a significant increase in our pension obligations and funding requirements could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and growth prospects 
our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers 
the loss of the services of key employees and officers  whether such loss is through resignation or other causes  or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and growth prospects

where we are able to reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur with respect to such a matter  we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate 
if we are able to reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other  we use the amount that is the low end of such range

risk factors 
overview we are the second largest provider of services in the domestic non hazardous solid waste industry  as measured by revenue 
we provide non hazardous solid waste collection services for commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers through collection companies in states and puerto rico 
we own or operate transfer stations  active solid waste landfills and recycling facilities 
we also operate landfill gas and renewable energy projects 
we completed our acquisition of allied waste industries  inc allied in december we believe that this acquisition creates a strong operating platform that will allow us to continue to provide quality service to our customers and superior returns to our stockholders 
despite the challenging economic environment  our business has performed well during due in large part to the indispensable nature of our services and the scalability of our business 
revenue for the year ended december  decreased by or million to  million as compared to  million during the comparable period in due to the allied acquisition  the doj required us to divest of certain assets and related liabilities 
the resulting divestitures  as well as other divestitures in the normal course of business  decreased revenue by for the year ended december  from the year ended december  excluding divested revenue  core revenue for the year ended december  was unchanged  consisting of a increase in core price  increase in commodity price and a increase in fuel charges  offset by a decrease of in core volume due to the continued weak economy 
the core price increase  together with operating efficiencies arising from the acquisition and cost control measures taken by our operations management to scale the business down for lower volumes  served to moderate profit margin declines 
during  we completed the integration of allied operations resulting in approximately million of annual run rate synergy savings  of which million relates to operating synergies and million relates to financing synergies  exceeding our original estimate of approximately million by 
since the acquisition in  we have repaid billion of net borrowings through december  and have refinanced billion of senior notes and million of tax exempt financings at lower interest rates 
free cash flow generated from operations allowed us to increase our regular quarterly dividend in the third quarter of and in november  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to million of our outstanding shares of common stock 

table of contents guidance our objectives for remain consistent with previous years and focus on enhancing stockholder value by increasing returns on invested capital and through the efficient use of free cash flow 
despite the challenging economy  we remain committed to continuing our broad based pricing program across all lines of business to recover increasing costs and to expand our operating margins 
our guidance is based on current economic conditions and does not assume any improvement or deterioration in the overall economy in specific guidance follows revenue we expect revenue to increase by approximately to 
this consists of the following increase decrease core price to volume to san mateo and toronto contract losses fuel surcharges commodities total change to approximately of our annual revenue is restricted as to the amount of certain pricing changes 
such restrictions on price increases include but are not limited to each of the following price changes based upon fluctuation in a specific index as defined in the contract  fixed price increases based on stated contract terms  or price changes based on a cost plus a specific profit margin or other measurement 
of these restricted pricing arrangements  approximately are based on a consumer price index  are fixed arrangements and the remainder are based upon a cost plus or other specific arrangement 
the consumer price index varies from a single historical stated period of time or an average of trailing historical rates over a stated period of time 
in addition  many pricing resets lag between the measurement period and the date the revised pricing goes into effect 
as a result  current changes in a specific index  such as the consumer price index  may not manifest themselves in our reported pricing for several quarters into the future 
property and equipment in  we anticipate receiving million of property and equipment 
purchases of property and equipment as reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows for are expected to be million and represent amounts paid during for such expenditures 
the difference between property and equipment received and purchases of property and equipment is adjustments for approximately million of property and equipment received during but paid for in recent developments subsequent to december   we i entered into certain interest rate locks with an aggregate notional amount in excess of million to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in anticipation of a planned issuance of senior notes in the first half of and ii financed the maturity of our million senior notes with proceeds from our credit facilities

our transfer station  landfill and  to a lesser extent  our material recovery facilities generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties 
in general  we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials 
other revenue consists primarily of revenue from sales of recyclable materials and revenue from national accounts 
national accounts revenue included in other revenue represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas  and  as such  the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators

as such  care should be taken when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies 
during the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of the total waste volume that we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate internalization 
this increase in internalization from to is due to a higher concentration of integrated hauling and landfill operations acquired in the allied acquisition 
cost of operations versus our cost of operations  as a percentage of revenue  decreased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of the following transfer and disposal  maintenance and repair  and transportation and subcontract costs continue to decrease versus the comparable period due to lower waste volumes and cost control measures 
risk management costs decreased during as we continued to experience favorable actuarial developments primarily attributable to our continued focus on safety 
partially offset by fuel expenses increased by million  or  year over year 
average fuel costs per gallon for the year ended december  were  an increase of or approximately from the average price of for the year ended december  landfill operating costs increased by million  or  year over year 
during the year ended december   we recovered million of insurance proceeds related to remediation costs at the countywide facility which reduced our landfill operating costs during that period 
there were no such recoveries during the comparable period 
the remainder of the increase in landfill operating costs is due to adjustments recorded at several remediation reserve sites 

table of contents cost of operations versus our cost of operations  as a percentage of revenue  improved to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the following transfer and disposal costs decreased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to lower fuel and disposal costs 
in addition  transfer and disposal costs were also favorably impacted by increased internalization of our waste streams into landfills either owned or operated by us 
fuel costs decreased approximately from an average of per gallon during to an average of per gallon during landfill operating costs decreased as a percentage of revenue  primarily due to charges we recorded during consisting of million related to estimated costs to comply with final findings and orders issued by the ohio environmental protection agency and the agreed order on consent issued by the environmental protection agency in response to environmental conditions at the countywide facility  million related to environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in california and million related to environmental conditions at the sunrise landfill 
these charges increased our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue by for the year ended december  other cost of operations increased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to increases in occupancy and facility expenses as well as equipment rental expense

depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  as a percentage of revenue  has remained consistent year over year 
depreciation  amortization and depletion of property and equipment versus the increase in depreciation  amortization and depletion expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to increases in depreciation and depletion expense associated with equipment and landfills acquired from allied and recorded at their fair values 
we allocated billion of fair value to the landfills we acquired from allied 
the increase in the landfill depletion and amortization in aggregate dollars is directly attributable to this allocation of fair value 
amortization of other intangible and other assets expenses for amortization of intangible and other assets were million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our other intangible and other assets primarily relate to customer lists  franchise agreements  municipal contracts  trade names  favorable lease assets and to a lesser extent non compete agreements

accretion expense accretion expense was million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in accretion expense in compared to is primarily due to the decrease in our weighted average credit adjusted risk free rate used to accrete new layers of our capping  closure and post closure liabilities and the divestiture of several landfills 
the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars in versus is primarily due to an increase in asset retirement obligations associated with the allied acquisition 
the asset retirement obligations acquired from allied are recorded using a discount rate of  which is higher than the credit adjusted  risk free rate we have used historically to record such obligations

our effective income tax rate was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate is adversely impacted by expenses incurred which are non deductible for tax  disposition of assets that have little or no basis for tax  and accruals for penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions 
in the future we may choose to divest certain operating assets that have little or no tax basis  thereby resulting in a higher taxable gain than otherwise would be recognized 
the higher taxable gain will increase our effective rate in the quarter in which the divestiture is consummated

landfill and environmental matters our landfill costs include daily operating expenses  costs of capital for cell development  costs for final capping  closure and post closure  and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance 
daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal  methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance  interim cap maintenance  and costs associated with the application of daily cover materials 
we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred 
we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development 
in life cycle accounting  certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace 
these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site  including excavation  natural and synthetic liners  construction of leachate collection systems  installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems  installation of groundwater monitoring wells  and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site 
obligations associated with final capping  closure and post closure are capitalized and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed 
cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 
these estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs 
changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs  available airspace  inflation and applicable regulations 
changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates  changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted

changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfill s footprint or vertical slopes 
as of december   we owned or operated active solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be billion in place cubic yards 
total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace 
these estimates are developed at least annually by engineers using information provided by annual aerial surveys 
as of december   total available disposal capacity is estimated to be billion in place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus billion in place cubic yards of probable expansion airspace 
before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and  therefore  included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity  it must meet all of our expansion criteria 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  landfill and environmental costs  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further information 
during  total available airspace increased by a net billion cubic yards primarily due to new expansions and net acquisitions offset by airspace consumed and divestitures 
during  total available airspace decreased by a net billion cubic yards primarily due to divestitures  closures and airspace consumed  partially offset by new expansions 
during  total available airspace increased by a net billion cubic yards due to the allied acquisition in december  which contributed active landfills representing billion cubic yards of permitted and probable expansion airspace 
excluding the allied acquisition  total available airspace related to republic s pre acquisition operations decreased by a net billion cubic yards  primarily due to airspace consumed  changes in engineering estimates and changes in design 
the decrease during due to changes in engineering estimates is primarily due to a reduction of remaining airspace at the countywide facility 

table of contents at december   of our total available airspace  or billion cubic yards  consisted of probable expansion airspace at eleven of our landfills 
at december   of our total available airspace  or billion cubic yards  consisted of probable expansion airspace at eight of our landfills 
between december  and december   we received permits for of our probable expansions  which demonstrates our continued success in obtaining permits for expansion airspace 
as of december   eight of our landfills meet all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity 
at projected annual volumes  these landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of years  including probable expansion airspace 
the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is years 
we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for probable expansion airspace

remediation and other charges for landfill matters in december  we finalized our purchase price allocation for the environmental liabilities we assumed as part of the allied acquisition 
these liabilities represent our estimate of costs to remediate sites that were previously owned or operated by allied or sites at which allied  or a predecessor company that it had acquired  had been identified as a potentially responsible party 
the remediation of these sites is in various stages of completion from having received an initial notice from a regulatory agency and commencing investigation to being in the final stages of post remedial monitoring 
see also note  summary of significant accounting policies environmental remediation liabilities  for further information 
we have recorded these liabilities at their estimated fair values using a discount rate of 
discounted liabilities are accreted to interest expense through the period that they are paid 
the following is a discussion of certain of our significant remediation matters countywide landfill 
in september  republic services of ohio ii  llc entered into final findings and orders with the ohio environmental protection agency that require us to implement a comprehensive operation and maintenance program to manage the remediation area at the countywide recycling and disposal facility countywide 
the remediation liability for countywide recorded as of december  is million  of which million is expected to be paid during we believe the reasonably possible range of loss for remediation costs is million to million

sunrise landfill 
in august  republic services of southern nevada rssn  signed a consent decree with the epa  the bureau of land management and clark county  nevada related to the sunrise landfill 
under the consent decree  rssn has agreed to perform certain remedial actions at the sunrise landfill for which rssn and clark county were otherwise jointly and severally liable 
we also paid million in sanctions related to the consent decree 
rssn is currently working with the clark county staff and board of commissioners to develop a mechanism to fund the costs to comply with the consent decree 
however  we have not recorded any potential recoveries 
the remediation liability for sunrise recorded as of december  is million  of which million is expected to be paid during we believe the reasonably possible range of loss for remediation costs is million to million 
congress landfill 
in august  congress development company agreed with the state of illinois to have a final consent order final order entered by the circuit court of illinois  cook county 
pursuant to the final order  we have agreed to continue to implement certain remedial activities at the congress landfill 
the remediation liability recorded as of december  is million  of which million is expected to be paid during we believe the reasonably possible range of loss for remediation costs is million to million 
it is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the liabilities noted above to reflect the effects of new or additional information  to the extent that such information impacts the costs  timing or duration of the required actions 
future changes in our estimates of the costs  timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

our compaction rates may improve as a result of the settlement and decomposition of waste 
as of december   we expect to spend an estimated additional billion on existing landfills  primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures  over their expected remaining lives 
our total expected investment  excluding non depletable land  estimated to be billion  or per cubic yard  is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the units of consumption method

proceeds received in were primarily the result of divesting certain assets as required by the doj as a condition of the allied acquisition 
change in restricted cash and marketable securities 
changes in our restricted cash and marketable securities balances  which are largely related to the issuance of tax exempt bonds for our capital needs and amounts held in trust as a guarantee of performance  contributed million and million to our investing activities in and compared to a million use of cash in funds received from issuances of tax exempt bonds are deposited directly into trust accounts by the bonding authority at the time of issuance 
as we do not have the ability to use these funds for general operating purposes  they are classified as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets 
proceeds from bond issuances into restricted trust accounts represent cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
reimbursements from the trust for qualifying expenditures are presented as cash provided by investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
during and  our reimbursements from restricted cash accounts exceeded funds received from the issuance of tax exempt bonds

cash premiums and fees paid in connection with the issuance of our and notes  premiums paid for note redemptions and fees paid to issue tax exempt indebtedness were million during in connection with the issuance of our senior notes as well as purchasing and retiring certain indebtedness in  we incurred cash premiums and fees totaling million 

table of contents purchase of common stock for treasury 
from through  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our common stock 
as of december   we had paid billion to repurchase million shares of our common stock  of which million was paid during to repurchase million shares 
the stock repurchase program was suspended in the second quarter of due to the pending allied acquisition

our billion revolving credit facility due april and our billion revolving credit facility due september collectively  credit facilities bear interest at a base rate  or a eurodollar rate  plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings all as defined in the agreements 
as of december  and  the interest rate for our borrowings under our credit facilities was and  respectively 
our credit facilities are also subject to facility fees based on applicable rates defined in the agreements and the aggregate commitments  regardless of usage 
availability under our credit facilities can be used for working capital  capital expenditures  letters of credit and other general corporate purposes 
we had million and million of eurodollar rate borrowings and nil and million of base rate borrowings as of december  and  respectively 
we had  million and  million of letters of credit utilizing availability under our credit facilities  leaving  million and million of availability under our credit facilities at december  and  respectively 
the agreements governing our credit facilities require us to comply with certain financial and other covenants 
we can pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants 
compliance with these covenants is a condition for any incremental borrowings under our credit facilities and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans which would adversely affect our liquidity 
at december   our ebitda to interest ratio was compared to the minimum required by the covenants  and our total debt to ebitda ratio was compared to the maximum allowed by the covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facilities  and we expect to be in compliance during ebitda  which is a non gaap measure  is calculated as defined in our credit facility agreements 
in this context  ebitda is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to ebitda used by other companies or used by us for other purposes 
in march  we issued million of senior notes due the notes and million of senior notes due the notes  and  together with the notes  the notes 
the notes are general senior unsecured obligations and mature on march  in the case of the notes and march  in the case of the notes 
interest is payable semi annually on march and september  beginning september  the notes are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that also guarantees our credit facilities 
these guarantees are general senior unsecured obligations of our subsidiary guarantors 
we used the net proceeds from the notes as follows i million to redeem the senior notes due at a premium of million principal outstanding  ii million to redeem the 
table of contents senior notes due at a premium of million principal outstanding  and iii the remainder to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facilities and for general corporate purposes 
we incurred a loss of million for premiums paid to repurchase debt  charges for unamortized debt discounts and professional fees paid to effectuate the repurchase of the senior notes 
in march  we repaid all borrowings and terminated our accounts receivable securitization program with two financial institutions that allowed us to borrow up to million on a revolving basis under loan agreements secured by receivables 
we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of million related to unamortized deferred issuance costs associated with terminating this program 
to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment grade rated financial institutions 
our outstanding swap agreements have a total notional value of million and require us to pay interest at floating rates based on changes in libor and receive interest at a fixed rate of 
our swap agreements mature in august at december   we had  million of tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings outstanding 
borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on fixed or floating interest rates at prevailing market rates ranging from to at december  and have maturities ranging from to as of december   we had million of restricted cash related to proceeds from tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings 
this restricted cash will be used to reimburse capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements 
during the year ended december   we refinanced million and repaid million of our tax exempt financings resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of million related to charges for unamortized debt discounts and professional fees paid to effectuate these transactions 
we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividend payments  share repurchases and debt repayments 
debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise 
we believe that our excess cash  cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 
in the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings 
we may also explore opportunities in capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable 
any early extinguishment of debt may result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repurchased and retired 
the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs 
fuel hedges we use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices 
we have entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases 
the agreements qualified for  and were designated as  effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases fuel hedges

if the national us on highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel is less than the contract price per gallon  we pay the difference to the counter party 
the fair values of our fuel hedges are obtained from third party counter parties and are determined using standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices being based on those observed in underlying markets level in the fair value hierarchy 
the aggregated fair values of the outstanding fuel hedges at december  and were current assets of million and million  respectively  and accrued liabilities of million and million  respectively  and have been recorded in other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  respectively 
the effective portions of the changes in fair values as of december  and  net of tax  of million and million  respectively  have been recorded in stockholders equity as components of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the ineffective portions of the changes in fair values as of december   and were immaterial and have been recorded in other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of income 
realized losses gains of million  million and million related to these fuel hedges are included in cost of operations in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  approximately of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements 
additionally  we were able to recover approximately of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees from certain of our customers 
recycling commodity hedges revenue from sale of recycling commodities is primarily from sales of old corrugated cardboard occ and old newspaper onp 
we use derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of these commodities 
we have entered into multiple agreements related to the forecasted occ and onp sales 
the agreements qualified for  and were designated as  effective hedges of changes in the prices of certain forecasted commodity sales commodity hedges

if the price of the commodity exceeds the contract price per short ton  we pay the difference to the counter party 
the fair values of our commodity swaps are obtained from third party counter parties and are determined using standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices being based on those observed in underlying markets level in the fair value hierarchy 
on december   we entered into a two year costless collar agreement on forecasted sales of  short tons of occ a month 
the agreement involves combining a purchased put option giving us the right to sell  short tons of occ monthly for months at an established floor strike price with a written call option obligating us to deliver  short tons of occ monthly for months at an established cap strike price 
the puts and calls have the same settlement dates  are net settled in cash on such date and have the same terms to expiration 
the contemporaneous combination of options resulted in no net premium for us and represents a costless collar 
under the agreement  we will not make or receive any payment  as long as the settlement price is between the floor price and cap price 
however  if the settlement price is above the cap  we would be required to pay the counterparty an amount equal to the excess of the settlement price over the cap times the monthly volumes hedged 
also  if the settlement price is below the floor  the counterparty would be required to pay us the deficit of the settlement price below the floor times the monthly volumes hedged 
the objective of this agreement is to reduce the variability of the cash flows of the forecasted sales of occ between two designated strike prices

table of contents the costless collar hedges are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
the fair values of the costless collars are obtained from the third party counter party and are determined using standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices based upon forward commodity price curves in underlying markets level in the fair value hierarchy 
the aggregated fair values of the outstanding commodity hedges at december  and were current assets of million and million  respectively  and current liabilities of million and million  respectively  and have been recorded in other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  respectively 
the effective portions of the changes in fair values of our commodity hedges as of december  and  net of tax  of million and million have been recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the ineffective portions of the changes in fair values as of december  and were immaterial and have been recorded in other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of income 
approximately of our tonnage sales volume of commodities were subject to cash flow hedges 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in millions maturities of notes payable  capital leases final capping  unconditional year ending operating and other long closure and purchase december  leases term debt post closure remediation commitments total thereafter total we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividend payments  share repurchases and debt repayments 
debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise 
we believe that our excess cash  cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 
in the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings 
we also may explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable 
the present value of capital lease obligations is included in our consolidated balance sheets 
the estimated remaining final capping  closure and post closure and remediation expenditures presented above are not inflated and not discounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december  unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of i disposal related agreements which include fixed or minimum royalty payments  host agreements and take or pay and put or pay agreements and ii other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements 
in addition to the above  we have unrecognized tax benefits at december  of million 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the unrecognized tax benefits at 
table of contents december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of any cash settlements 
we also have letters of credit of billion  of which billion utilize availability under our credit facilities at december  debt covenants our credit facilities contain financial covenants 
we can pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our credit facilities 
we were also in compliance with the non financial covenants in the indentures relating to our senior notes as of december  we expect to be in compliance with our covenants during failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facilities  as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events  would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under our credit facilities to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreements 
this could also have an adverse impact on the availability of financial assurances 
in addition  maturity acceleration on our credit facilities constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments  including our senior notes  and  therefore  our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity 
if such acceleration were to occur  we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness 
we would likely have to seek an amendment under our credit facilities for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity  or asset sales  if necessary 
we may be unable to amend our credit facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 
financial assurance we must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping  closure and post closure costs  and related to our performance under certain collection  landfill and transfer station contracts 
we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds  letters of credit  insurance policies or trust deposits 
the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping  closure and post closure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations 
the financial assurance requirements for capping  closure and post closure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill 
generally  states will require a third party engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping  closure and post closure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill 
the amount of financial assurance required can  and generally will  differ from the obligation determined and recorded under us gaap 
the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract 
additionally  we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations 
we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during  although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 
these financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered company indebtedness 
because we currently have no liability for these financial assurance instruments  they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
however  we record capping  closure and post closure liabilities and self insurance liabilities as they are incurred 
the underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments  in excess of those already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  would be recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations 
we do not expect this to occur 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet debt or similar obligations  other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases  that are not classified as debt 
we do not guarantee any third party debt 

table of contents free cash flow we define free cash flow  which is not a measure determined in accordance with us gaap  as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment  plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
our free cash flow for the years ended december   and is calculated as follows in millions cash provided by operating activities purchases of property and equipment proceeds from sales of property and equipment free cash flow for a discussion of the changes in the components of free cash flow  you should read our discussion regarding cash flows provided by operating activities and cash flows used in investing activities contained elsewhere in this form k 
purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the free cash flow table above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures 
a reconciliation of property and equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period for the years ended december   and is as follows in millions purchases of property and equipment per the consolidated statements of cash flows adjustments for property and equipment received during the prior period but paid for in the following period  net property and equipment received during the period the adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment received  plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment 
it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy  which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service  investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided  maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt  paying cash dividends and repurchasing common stock  and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization 
in addition  free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation 
the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations 
free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments 
our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
contingencies for a description of our contingencies  see note  income taxes  and note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
critical accounting judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management 
the following is a list of accounting policies 
table of contents that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
such critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments 
we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas 
residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast 
accounting for the allied acquisition acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase method of accounting requires that the purchase price paid for an acquisition be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the effective date of the acquisition  with the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired being recorded as goodwill 
the consolidated financial statements of the acquirer include the operating results of the acquired business from the date of the acquisition  and are not retroactively restated to include the historical position or the results of operations of the acquired business 
these estimates are revised during the allocation period when the information necessary to finalize the fair value estimates is received and analyzed  or if information regarding contingencies becomes available to further define and quantify the assets and liabilities acquired 
we have completed valuing all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the allied acquisition 
adjustments  if any  to our estimates of fair values and the resulting purchase price allocation in future periods will be reflected in our consolidated statement of income 
the significant areas of accounting where estimates of fair values are reflected in our consolidated financial statements include landfills and other property and equipment  other intangible assets  landfill asset retirement obligations  legal and environmental reserves  self insurance reserves  income taxes  other non current assets and long term obligations  and assets held for sale 
our consolidated financial statements also include our estimates of restructuring costs incurred through december   a portion of which will be paid in future periods 
residual risks the residual risks identified below related to critical accounting judgments and estimates are relevant to the fair value estimation processes for acquisitions 
for discussion of other significant residual risks inherent in the accounting for acquisitions  see item a 
risk factors 
landfill accounting landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further herein 
our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories  each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates landfill development costs that are capitalized as an asset 
landfill retirement obligations relating to our capping  closure and post closure liabilities which result in a corresponding landfill retirement asset 
landfill development costs we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site 
in life cycle accounting  all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized  and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace 
obligations associated with final capping  closure and post closure are also capitalized  and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed 
cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 
site permits 
in order to develop  construct and operate a landfill  we are required to obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local  state and federal levels 
the permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations 
the initial studies are reviewed by 
table of contents our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but prior to the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted 
residual risks changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes to the landfill site permitting process 
these changes could make it more difficult and costly to obtain and maintain a landfill permit 
studies performed could be inaccurate  which could result in the denial or revocation of a permit and changes to accounting assumptions 
conditions could exist that were not identified in the study  which may make the location not feasible for a landfill and could result in the denial of a permit 
denial or revocation of a permit could impair the recorded value of the landfill asset 
actions by neighboring parties  private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain  maintain or expand permits could result in denial  revocation or suspension of a permit  which could adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill and could impair the recorded value of the landfill 
as a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit  improved technical information as a project progresses  or changes in the anticipated economics associated with a project  we may decide to reduce the scope of or abandon a project  which could result in an asset impairment 
technical landfill design 
upon receipt of initial regulatory approval  technical landfill designs are prepared 
the technical designs  which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required  are reviewed by our environmental management group 
the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
upon approval of the technical designs  the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 
residual risks changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical design 
these changes could make it more difficult and costly to meet new design standards 
technical design requirements  as approved  may need modifications at some future point in time 
technical designs could be inaccurate and could result in increased construction costs  difficulty in obtaining a permit or the use of rates to recognize the amortization of landfill development costs and asset retirement obligations that are not appropriate 
permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity 
included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill 
these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed  such as the depth of excavation  the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the side slope construction 
the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards 
this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a site specific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 
residual risks estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements 
the density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions  including waste compaction practices  site design  climate and the nature of the waste 
capacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is measured in tons 
the number of tons per cubic yard varies by type of waste and our rate of compaction 
development costs 
the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation  natural and synthetic liners  construction of leachate collection systems  installation of methane gas 
table of contents collection systems and monitoring probes  installation of groundwater monitoring wells  construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site 
we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with third party bids or contractual arrangements  reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness  and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs 
these development costs  together with any costs incurred to acquire  design and permit the landfill  including capitalized interest  are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 
residual risk actual future costs of construction materials and third party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the availability of the required materials and labor 
technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions  regulatory changes or legislative changes 
landfill development asset amortization 
in order to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations  we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a per ton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill 
the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill s operating life 
the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfill s estimated remaining disposal capacity 
the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted  but rather expressed in nominal dollars 
this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period 
amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill  including acquisition costs  which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values 
we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value 
amortization rates are also influenced by site specific engineering and cost factors 
residual risk changes in our future development cost estimates or our disposal capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization rates and will impact amortization expense prospectively 
an unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill and result in asset impairment 
on at least an annual basis  we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill 
these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually 
changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 
landfill asset retirement obligations we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills capping and closure and post closure 
obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event 
obligations related to closure and post closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill 
landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units of consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill  depending on the nature of the obligation 
all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value 
fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our credit adjusted  risk free rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred 
future costs for final capping  closure and post closure are developed at least annually by engineers  and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 

table of contents landfill capping 
as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity  we are required to cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit 
these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill site process previously described 
closure and post closure 
closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill site stops receiving waste  but prior to being certified as closed 
after the entire landfill site has reached capacity and is certified closed  we are required to maintain and monitor the site for a post closure period  which generally extends for years 
costs associated with closure and post closure requirements generally include maintenance of the site and the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems  and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste 
costs associated with post closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling  analysis and statistical reports  third party labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance  transportation and disposal of leachate  and erosion control costs related to the final cap 
the initial liabilities recorded as part of the allied acquisition were recorded using provisional amounts based upon information available at that time 
during  we gathered and assessed new information obtained about the facts and circumstances surrounding our remediation sites  and as a result increased the fair value of our closure and post closure reserves by million 
any further adjustments to our reserves resulting in changes in estimate or settlements will be reflected in our consolidated statement of income in the periods in which such adjustments become known 
landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets 
estimates of the total future costs required to cap  close and monitor the landfill as specified by each landfill permit are updated annually 
the estimates include inflation  the specific timing of future cash outflows  and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events 
our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation  which is updated annually and is based upon the ten year average consumer price index in both and 
the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and post closure costs for the landfill are recorded as incurred on a per ton basis 
these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 
capping  closure and post closure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our credit adjusted risk free rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred in and in 
retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities 
this accretion is charged to operating expenses 
actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made 
corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a per ton basis as disposal capacity is consumed 
the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset s net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity 
a per ton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event 
closure and post closure per ton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 
residual risks changes in legislative or regulatory requirements  including changes in capping  closure activities or post closure monitoring activities  types and quantities of materials used  or term of post closure care  could cause changes in our cost estimates 
changes in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in the anticipated waste flow  changes in airspace compaction estimates or changes in the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results of operations prospectively 
this could result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense 

table of contents actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing  causing differences in timing of when amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
changes in inflation rates could impact our actual future costs and our total liabilities 
changes in our capital structure or market conditions could result in changes to the credit adjusted risk free rate used to discount the liabilities  which could cause changes in future recorded liabilities  assets and expense 
amortization rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill capping design  post closure monitoring requirements  or the inflation or discount rate 
on an annual basis  we update our estimates of future capping  closure and post closure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill 
revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping  closure and post closure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets 
changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively  except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills  where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed 
in connection with the annual review of our calculations with respect to landfill asset retirement obligations  we made a change in estimate  which is considered to be a change in accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle 
this change  which we believe is preferable  was made to better align the estimated amount of waste placed in an area to be capped which is used to calculate our capping rates with the physical operation of our landfills 
the expected costs related to our capping events did not change and we will continue to use separate rates for each capping event 
this change resulted in a million decrease in our capping asset retirement obligations and related assets 
these assets will be amortized to expense prospectively as a change in estimate 
this change in estimate will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
permitted and probable disposal capacity 
as described previously  disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit 
we classify this disposal capacity as permitted 
we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates  thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion 
probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies  but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is probable 
we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace 
we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted 
however  because some of these criteria are judgmental  they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted 
in either of these scenarios  our amortization  depletion and accretion expense could change significantly 
our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion are as follows we own the land associated with the expansion airspace or control it pursuant to an option agreement  we are committed to supporting the expansion project financially and with appropriate resources  there are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated with the project  including political impediments  progress is being made on the project  the expansion is attainable within a reasonable time frame  and we believe it is likely the expansion permit will be received 
after successfully meeting these criteria  the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates 
additionally  for purposes of calculating landfill 
table of contents amortization and capping  closure and post closure rates  we include the incremental costs to develop  construct  close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 
residual risk we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the final local  state or federal permits or due to other unknown reasons 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity  or the disposal capacity for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated  both our estimated total costs and disposal capacity will be reduced  which generally increases the rates we charge for landfill amortization and capping  closure and post closure accruals 
an unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could also cause an asset impairment 
environmental liabilities we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business 
under current laws and regulations  we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate  including sites that we have acquired  or sites where we have or a company that we have acquired has delivered waste 
our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater  surface water and soil contamination  as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs 
to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites  we evaluate several factors  including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site  the required remediation methods  the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties 
we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies 
we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary 
changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known 
adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts 
we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies 
the environmental liabilities assumed from allied relate to impacts at both owned and unowned sites 
in the case of owned sites  we are actively working with the appropriate regulatory entity under the applicable regulations typically rcra or cercla to characterize and remediate potential issues 
at unowned sites  we are working within the regulatory and procedural framework established by cercla to characterize and remediate potential issues  in conjunction with other potentially liable parties at each location 
pursuant to the purchase method of accounting  we have recorded the environmental remediation liabilities assumed from allied based upon estimates of their fair value  using an estimate of future cash flows or settlement 
previously  and consistent with our method of accounting  allied recorded remediation liabilities based upon accounting for loss contingencies  however  amounts recorded under this method are generally not at fair value 
since the date of acquisition  our process for deriving fair value for the environmental liabilities assumed from allied included first identifying the population of remediation sites where we are either fully or partially responsible for remediation or potential remediation 
the population of remediation sites was then stratified into categories based on i the maturity of the issue relative to recognized stages in the applicable regulation typically cercla or rcra and ii the extent of our participation in the remediation activity 
using these categories  we applied one of the following multiple estimation processes to quantify fair value for sites with established responsibility but a high level of uncertainty with the outcome of the remedial process  we developed multiple remediation scenarios 
we then probability weighted the remediation scenarios to develop a fair value estimate 
for sites where the level of responsibility was less defined  we developed a fair value estimate of the settlement costs based upon market participant assessments from external legal counsel 

table of contents for sites which we own and are in the earliest stages of the remedial process  we identified the most applicable standard remedial techniques and then probability weighted the use of each technique to develop a fair value estimate 
for the remaining sites with low levels of uncertainty  we developed a primary remedial strategy and cost estimate to determine the fair value of the liability 
the initial liabilities recorded as part of the allied acquisition were recorded using provisional amounts based upon information available at that time 
during  we gathered and assessed new information obtained about the facts and circumstances surrounding allied s remediation sites 
in certain situations  we used external engineers and attorneys to assist in the development of our fair value estimates 
as a result of the process  we increased the fair value of our remediation reserves by million 
any further adjustments to our remediation reserves resulting from changes in estimates or reserve settlements will be reflected currently in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments become known 
residual risks we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of our environmental remediation liabilities 
our estimates of these liabilities require assumptions about future events that are uncertain 
consequently  our estimates could change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of contamination  the required remediation methods  the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties identified  the financial viability of those parties  and the actions of governmental agencies or private parties with interests in the matter 
actual amounts could differ from the estimated liabilities as a result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution 
an unanticipated environmental liability that arises could result in a material charge to our consolidated statement of income 
self insurance reserves and related costs our insurance programs for workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured 
accruals for self insurance reserves are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
we maintain high deductibles for commercial general liability  automobile liability and workers compensation coverage  ranging from million to million 
residual risks incident rates  including frequency and severity  and other actuarial assumptions could change causing our current and future actuarially determined obligations to change  which would be reflected in our consolidated statement of income in the period in which such adjustment is known 
it is possible that recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims 
adjustments  if any  to estimates recorded resulting from ultimate claim payments would be reflected in the consolidated statements of income in the periods in which such adjustments are known 
the settlement costs to discharge our obligations  including legal and health care costs  could increase or decrease causing current estimates of our self insurance reserves to change 
loss contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings  claims and regulatory matters  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
we determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible or probable  and whether it can be reasonably estimated 
we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities 
management s assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
we record and disclose loss contingencies pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance for such matter 

table of contents we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling  general and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 
residual risks actual costs may vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons  including differing interpretations of laws  opinions on culpability and assessments of the amount of damages 
loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and generally involve business matters that are by their nature unpredictable 
if a loss contingency results in an adverse judgment or is settled for a significant amount  it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  result of operations or cash flows in the period in which such judgment or settlement occurs 
asset impairment valuation methodology 
we evaluate our long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets or we intend to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets 
residual risk if events or changes in circumstances occur  including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations or determinations to divest assets  certain assets could be impaired which would result in a non cash charge to earnings 
evaluation criteria 
we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 
examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset  a change in its physical condition  or new circumstances that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a long lived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
residual risk our most significant asset impairment exposure  other than goodwill which is discussed below relates to our landfills 
a significant reduction in our estimated disposal capacity as a result of unanticipated events such as regulatory developments  revocation of an existing permit or denial of an expansion permit  or changes in our assumptions used to calculate disposal capacity  could trigger an impairment charge 
recognition criteria 
if such circumstances arise  we recognize impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
we generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 
goodwill recoverability we annually test goodwill for impairment at december or when an indicator of impairment exists 
we test goodwill for impairment using the two step process 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we have defined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments eastern  midwestern  southern  and western 
in determining fair value  we primarily utilize discounted future cash flows and operating results based on a comparative multiple of earnings or revenues 

table of contents significant estimates used in our fair value calculation utilizing discounted future cash flows include  but are not limited to i estimates of future revenue and expense growth by reporting unit  which we estimate to range from to  ii future estimated effective tax rates  which we estimate to be  iii future estimated capital expenditures as well as future required investments in working capital  iv estimated discount rates  which we estimate to range between and  and v the future terminal value of the reporting unit  which is based on its ability to exist into perpetuity 
significant estimates used in the fair value calculation utilizing market value multiples include but are not limited to i estimated future growth potential of the reporting unit  ii estimated multiples of revenue or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay  and iii estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay 
in addition  we evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests  indicating a possible impairment 
examples of such events or circumstances include i a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  ii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  iii a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof will be sold  iv continued or sustained losses at a reporting unit  v a significant decline in our market capitalization as compared to our book value  or vi the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit 
we assign assets and liabilities from our corporate reporting segment to our four operating segments to the extent that such assets or liabilities relate to the cash flows of the reporting unit and would be included in determining the reporting unit s fair value 
in preparing our annual test for impairment as of december   we determined that our indicated fair value of equity exceeded our market capitalization 
we determined market capitalization as the fair value of our common shares outstanding at the closing market price on december  we believe one of the primary reconciling differences between the indicated fair value of equity and our market capitalization is due to a control premium 
we believe the control premium represents the value a market participant could extract as savings and or synergies by obtaining control  and thereby eliminating duplicative overhead and operating costs resulting from the consolidation of routes and internalization of waste streams 
as of december   we determined that the indicated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by a range of to in excess of and  as such  we noted no indicators of impairment at our reporting units 
we will continuously monitor market trends in our business  the related expected cash flows and our calculation of market capitalization for purposes of identifying possible indicators of impairment 
if our book value per share exceeds our market price per share or if we have other indicators of impairment  we will be required to perform an interim step one impairment analysis  which may lead to a step two analysis and possible impairment of our goodwill 
additionally  we would then be required to review our remaining long lived assets for impairment 
our operating segments  which also represent our reporting units  are comprised of several vertically integrated businesses 
when an individual business within an integrated operating segment is divested  goodwill is allocated to that business based on its fair value relative to the fair value of its operating segment 
residual risks future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with acquired businesses is impaired 
the valuation of identifiable goodwill requires significant estimates and judgment about future performance  cash flows and fair value 
our future results could be affected if these current estimates of future performance and fair value change 
for example  a reduction in long term growth assumptions could reduce the estimated fair value of the operating segments to below their carrying values  which could trigger an impairment charge 
similarly  an increase in our discount rate could trigger an impairment charge 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets other than non deductible goodwill and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making this determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce our provision for income taxes 
regarding the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements  we record a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income 
accrued interest and penalties are included within other accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes and other long term tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
residual risks income tax assets and liabilities established in purchase accounting for acquisitions are based on assumptions that could differ from the ultimate outcome of the tax matters 
such adjustments would be charged or credited to earnings  unless they meet certain remeasurement criteria and are allowed to be adjusted to goodwill 
changes in the estimated realizability of deferred tax assets could result in adjustments to our provision for income taxes 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes are based on our judgment 
if our judgments and estimates concerning valuation allowances and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards are incorrect  our provision for income taxes would change 
we are currently under examination or administrative review by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years 
the internal revenue code irc and income tax regulations are a complex set of rules that we are required to interpret and apply 
positions taken in tax years under examination or subsequent years are subject to challenge 
accordingly  we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities arising from these audits if any positions taken by us or by companies we have acquired are disallowed by the taxing authorities 
we adjust our liabilities for uncertain tax positions when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  their ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimates of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to our provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined 
defined benefit pension plans we currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan  the bfi retirement plan the plan 
the plan covers certain employees in the united states  including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements 
the plan s benefit formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in the plan document 
the benefits of approximately of the current plan participants were frozen upon allied s acquisition of bfi in 
table of contents our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the employee retirement income security act of and irc  as amended by the pension protection act of the plan s assets are invested as determined by our retirement benefits committee 
at december   the plan assets were invested in fixed income bond funds  equity funds and cash 
we annually review and adjust the plan s asset allocation as deemed necessary 
our unfunded benefit obligation for the plan was million as of december  compared to million as of december  residual risk changes in the plan s investment mix and performance of the equity and bond markets and fund managers could impact the amount of pension income or expense recorded  the funded status of the plan and the need for future cash contributions

the benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the plan are determined based on assumptions concerning items such as discount rates  expected rates of return and average rates of compensation increases 
our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary 
we determine the discount rate based on a model which matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the plan measurement date 
where that timing does not correspond to a published high quality bond rate  our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate 
the yield on the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability 
if the discount rate were to increase by  our benefit obligation would decrease by approximately million 
if the discount rate were to decrease by  our benefit obligation would increase by approximately million 
in developing our expected rate of return assumption  we evaluate long term expected and historical returns on the plan assets  giving consideration to our asset mix and the anticipated duration of the plan obligations 
the average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned 
less than of participants in the plan continue to earn service benefits 
residual risks our assumed discount rate is sensitive to changes in market based interest rates 
a decrease in the discount rate will increase our related benefit plan obligation 
our annual pension expense would be impacted if the actual return on plan assets were to vary from the expected return

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor 
we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
the carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable and  accordingly  approximates current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities 
the fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change

fuel price risk fuel costs represent a significant operating expense 
when economically practical  we may enter into new or renew contracts  or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk 
where appropriate  we have implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our fuel costs 
while we charge these fees to a majority of our customers  we are unable to charge such fees to all customers 
consequently  an increase in fuel costs results in an increase in our cost of operations  a smaller increase in our revenue from the fuel recovery fee and a decrease in our operating margin percentage  because the increase in revenue is more than offset by the increase in cost 
conversely  a decrease in fuel costs results in a decrease in our cost of operations  a smaller decrease in our revenue and an increase in our operating margin percentage 
at our current consumption levels  a one cent change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately million on an annual basis  which would be partially offset by a smaller change in the fuel recovery fees charged to our customers 
accordingly  a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 
our operations also require the use of certain petrochemical based products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals 
an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products  which would increase our operating and capital costs 
we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel surcharges from our vendors 
commodities prices we market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from our material recycling facilities 
as a result  changes in the market prices of these items will impact our results of operations 
revenue from sales of these products in  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively
