item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our corporate mission is to provide energy for the future by exploring for  developing new  and re establishing pre existing sources of energy worldwide 
we are currently exploring for oil and gas offshore guinea  northwest africa 
we intend to continue acquiring  exploring and developing oil and gas properties on a global basis 
at this time  we have no source of operating revenue and there is no assurance when we will  if ever 
we have no operating cash flows and require substantial additional funds  through additional participants  securities offerings  or through other means  to fulfill our long term business plans 
our operating plan within the next months includes the following 
table of contents drilling and evaluating the data from two exploratory wells in our concession offshore guinea in the fourth quarter of after completing technical work and planning with dana 
if we add other psc participants  we would expect to include the assignment of a portion of our interest in the concession to such participants 
acquire  process  and interpret a new d seismic survey covering approximately  square kilometers on our contract area 
the new deep water survey will be adjacent to our survey a  where we acquired our initial  square kilometer d seismic survey in the new deep water d survey will allow us to study upper cretaceous submarine fan structures along the transform margin trend of guinea in northwest africa 
we reached a tender agreement with a company regarding this contract in august and plan to finalize the contract soon 
we expect that the survey will begin before the end of assignment of participating interest on december   we entered into a sale and purchase agreement spa with dana for dana to acquire a participation interest in the psc 
on january   we closed on the transaction with dana  and we entered into an assignment of participating interest the assignment with dana  a deed of assignment and joint operating agreement joa 
pursuant to the assignment  we assigned to dana an undivided of our participating interest in the contractual interests  rights  obligations and duties under the psc 
as required by the psc  the deed of assignment was delivered as the necessary notice of the assignment to be given to the guinean government 
the joa appoints us as the operator for purposes of conducting oil and gas exploration and production activities within the retained contract area 
we share operating costs of joint operations with dana in proportion to the parties respective participating interests hyperdynamics   dana  
an operating committee and voting procedures are established in the joa whereby managerial and technical representatives of hyperdynamics and dana make decisions regarding joint operations  exploration and appraisal of commercial discoveries  and the disposition of commercial production 
the joa places restrictions upon the transfer of the parties respective participating interests in the form of a right of first purchase that is triggered by a proposed transfer or certain changes in control of us or dana 
as part of the obligation to bear the proportionate share of costs  the spa required dana to make a cash payment to us upon closing the assignment of the participating interest to dana in the amount of million for dana s pro rata portion of accrued expenditures associated with our marine d seismic data acquisition program within the contract area 
the million payment was received by us on february  and was recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of our concession 
in may  we received an administrative order from the ministry of mines and geology of guinea  referred to as an arr t  confirming the guinea government s approval of the assignment of a participating interest in the psc to dana 
on may   we received a payment of million in cash from dana  which was recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of our guinea concession  as payment for the assigned participating interest in the contractual interests  rights  obligations and duties under the psc 
sources of financing during the year ended june  on november   we entered into a stock purchase agreement with two institutional funds under management of affiliates of blackrock collectively  the investors pursuant to which the investors agreed to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share in a private placement 
at closing  we received approximately million  net of offering costs 
on march   we entered into an underwriting agreement providing for the offer and sale in a firm commitment underwritten offering of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share per share net of underwriting discount but before deducting transaction expenses 
in addition  we granted to the underwriter a day option to purchase up to  additional shares of common stock from us at the offering price  less underwriting discounts and commissions 
on march   the underwriter exercised its option with respect to all  shares 
closing of the sale of the shares of common stock  including the  shares purchased pursuant to exercise of the option by the underwriter  was held on march  the company received net proceeds  after underwriting discounts and commissions  and other transaction expenses  of approximately million 
during fiscal   options were exercised for total gross proceeds of  the options were exercised at prices ranging from to 
during fiscal   warrants were exercised for total gross proceeds of  the warrants were exercised at prices ranging from to 
analysis of changes in financial position our current assets increased by  from  on june  to  on june  the increase in current assets is due to the sources of financing described above  which lead to an increase in our cash account from  at june   to 
table of contents  at june   and an increase in short term investments to  at june  we held no investments at june  our long term assets increased  from  on june   to  on june  this increase was primarily due to our d seismic acquisition and processing and expenditures for long lead items necessary to prepare for drilling our first well 
additionally  the increase can be attributed to an increase in long term restricted cash to  at june  as compared to no long term restricted cash at june  upon receipt of the million from dana in may  we reduced our investment in unevaluated oil and gas properties in guinea to zero  with the remainder of the proceeds being recorded as a gain on the sale of this participation interest 
therefore our investment in unevaluated oil and gas properties in guinea at june  was  which represents capitalized costs incurred in june our current liabilities decreased  from  on june  to  on june  the main factor in the decrease is accounts payable and accrued expenses  which decreased from  at june   to  at june  accounts payable at june   included amounts payable related primarily to our investments in our concession and corporate activities 
the decrease in accounts payable is due to a decrease in accrued employee bonus expense resulting from the timing of bonus payments 
additionally  the decrease in current liabilities can be attributed to a decrease in dividends payable and short term notes payable as these two liabilities totaling  were settled in our long term liabilities decreased from  at june   to  at june   due primarily to the  of warrant derivative liability that was on the balance sheet at june  being converted into common shares during this derivative liability related to the issuance of warrants which had an adjustment provision applicable to the exercise price that adjusted the exercise price downward in the event we issued common stock  stock warrants  stock options or convertible debt with a stock price  exercise price or conversion price lower than the recipient s exercise price  originally per share

liquidity and capital resources capital resource considerations we did not have revenues from operations in the years ended june  or since june   we have raised i million from warrants and stock option exercises  ii million from the sale of common stock to funds managed by blackrock on november   and iii million from the sale of common stock in a public offering completed on march  as a result  we believe we have adequate capital resources to meet our working capital requirements for the next twelve months  including drilling our two exploratory wells and acquiring a new deep water d seismic survey 

table of contents you should carefully consider the risks described in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  in evaluating our company 
we will require substantial additional funding to drill additional wells in offshore guinea  either from capital raised  sales of participation interests  or through other means 
liquidity on june   we had  in cash and  in liabilities 
the liabilities include current liabilities of  and long term liabilities of  net cash used in operating activities for continuing operations for the year ended june  was  compared to  for the year ended june  cash used by investing activities for continuing operations for the year ended june  was  compared to  provided by investing activities in the year ended june  there was net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  of  while net cash of  was provided by financing activities during the year ended june  contractual commitments and obligations our subsidiary  scs  has  remaining of a contingent note payable due to the former owners of scs corporation s assets 
it is payable in our common stock and it is payable only if scs has net income in any given quarter 
if scs experiences net income in a quarter  of the income will be paid against the note  until the contingency is satisfied 
disclosure of contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years installment obligations operating lease obligations total we are subject to certain commitments under the psc as discussed above 
critical accounting policies we account for oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting as prescribed by the united states securities and exchange commission sec 
accordingly  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development of proved oil and natural gas properties  including the costs of abandoned properties  dry holes  geophysical costs  and annual lease rentals are capitalized 
all general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred 
sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change  or to the extent that the sale proceeds exceed our capitalized costs 
depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method based on proved reserves 
the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at  net of tax considerations 
in accordance with sec release  prices based on the preceding months average price based on closing prices on the first day of each month  or prices defined by existing contractual arrangements  are used in deriving future net revenues discounted at  net of tax 
the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher depreciation  depletion and amortization rates compared to the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
costs excluded costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves 
we review our unevaluated properties at the end of each quarter to determine whether the costs incurred should be transferred to the full cost pool and thereby subject to amortization 
we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant 
the assessment includes consideration of the following factors  among others intent to drill  remaining lease term  geological and geophysical evaluations  drilling results and activity  the assignment of proved reserves  and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned 
we assess our unevaluated properties on a country by country basis 
during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment  the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for 
table of contents such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization 
however  if proved reserves have not yet been established in a full cost pool  these costs are charged against earnings 
for international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established  an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information 
impairment at june    we had  of capitalized costs associated with our guinea operations 
based on an impairment analysis performed by management and the completion of work requirements under the psc  no impairment of these assets was indicated at june  environmental obligations and other contingencies management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation  litigation and other contingent matters 
provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made 
estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters  including  but not limited to  the stage of investigation  the stage of the remedial design  evaluation of existing remediation technologies  and presently enacted laws and regulations 
in future periods  a number of factors could significantly change our estimate of environmental remediation costs  such as changes in laws and regulations  or changes in their interpretation or administration  revisions to the remedial design  unanticipated construction problems  identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater  and changes in costs of labor  equipment and technology 
consequently  it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from our estimates 
fair value of our debt and equity transactions many of our various debt and equity transactions require us to determine the fair value of a debt or equity instrument in order to properly record the transaction in our financial statements 
fair value is generally determined by applying widely acceptable valuation models  eg  the black scholes and binomial lattice valuation models using the trading price of the underlying instrument or by comparison to instruments with comparable maturities and terms 
share based compensation we follow asc which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee is required to perform the services in exchange for the award presumptively the vesting period 
asc also requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award based on the grant date fair value of the award 
we account for non employee share based awards based upon the provisions of asc  equity based payments to non employees 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our functional currency is the us dollar 
we have some foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from our in country offices in guinea and the united kingdom 
us dollars are accepted in guinea and many of our purchases and purchase obligations  such as our office lease in guinea  are denominated in us dollars 
however  our costs for labor  supplies  and fuel could increase if the guinea franc or the pound sterling significantly appreciates against the us dollar 
we do not hedge the exposure to currency rate changes
