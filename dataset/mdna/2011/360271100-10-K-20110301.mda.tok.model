overview net income available to common shareholders increased million  or  to million in as compared to million in diluted net income per common share increased  or  to in from in the following is a summary of the significant factors impacting the corporation s financial performance in asset quality the financial services industry continued to be challenged by general economic conditions throughout while there had been some improvements in local and national economic conditions during the year  the economic recovery in general has been slower than expected  and conditions remain unsettled 
the most notable area where the improving  but unstable  economic conditions were evident was in asset quality  which saw some deterioration during the first nine months of  but showed signs of improvement during the fourth quarter 
the provision for credit losses decreased million  or  to million in  as compared to million in while both non performing assets and net charge offs increased  additional provisions for credit losses were not needed as allowance allocations were considered to be sufficient 
this relationship between the provision for credit losses and net charge offs is not unusual  since the recognition of losses through the provision generally occurs before such losses are realized through a charge off against the allowance for credit losses 
in the fourth quarter of  non performing assets and delinquency levels both improved in comparison to the third quarter 
this was the first time improvements in these measures in comparison to the preceding quarter had occurred since the second quarter of while there is still much uncertainty about the economic outlook and the potential effects on financial performance  particularly asset quality  the corporation believes that it has taken the appropriate steps to manage its exposures and continues to actively monitor its portfolio for signs of further deterioration 

table of contents net interest income and net interest margin net interest income increased million  or  to million in as compared to million in the net interest margin increased basis points  or  to in as compared to in the increases in both net interest income and net interest margin were primarily attributable to decreases in funding costs as interest rates remained at historically low levels throughout the year 
in addition  average core demand and savings accounts increased billion  or  which also contributed to a decrease in funding costs  as well as an improvement in the corporation s overall liquidity position 
this increase in deposits reduced the corporation s wholesale funding position  mostly through reductions to average federal funds purchased and advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb 
other income growth total other income increased million  or  mainly due to a million  or  increase in mortgage banking income and a million  or  increase in other service charges and fees 
mortgage banking income increased as margins on loans sold increased  while refinance volumes remained high in the low interest rate environment that existed for most of other service charges growth was driven by higher debit card  foreign currency processing and merchant fee transaction volumes 
expense control total other expenses decreased million  or  and the efficiency ratio improved to in as compared to in while expenses included a one time million fdic assessment  other discretionary expenses remained well controlled during common stock offering and exit from capital purchase program in may  the corporation issued million shares of its common stock  in an underwritten public offering  for net proceeds of million 
as a result of this common stock issuance  weighted average diluted shares increased to million in from million in in july  the corporation redeemed all  outstanding shares of its series a preferred stock with a total payment to the u 
s 
treasury department ust of million  consisting of million of principal and million of dividends 
in september  the corporation repurchased an outstanding common stock warrant for the purchase of million shares of its common stock for million  completing the corporation s participation in the ust s capital purchase program cpp 
as a result of the exit from cpp  preferred stock dividends and accretion decreased million  or 
in addition  shareholders equity decreased million  or  at december  in comparison to despite the decrease in shareholders equity  all regulatory capital ratios exceeded the minimum levels to be considered well capitalized by at least basis points 
legislation and regulation on july   the president of the united states signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act 
among other things  the dodd frank act creates the financial stability oversight council  with oversight authority for monitoring and regulating systemic risk  and the bureau of consumer financial protection  which will have broad regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services 
the dodd frank act also changes the responsibilities of the current federal banking regulators  imposes additional corporate governance and disclosure requirements in areas such as executive compensation and proxy access  and limits or prohibits proprietary trading and hedge fund and private equity activities of banks 
the scope of the dodd frank act impacts many aspects of the financial services industry  and it requires the development and adoption of many implementing regulations over the next several months and years 
the effects of the dodd frank act on the financial services industry will depend  in large part  upon the extent to which regulators exercise the authority granted to them under the dodd frank act and the approaches taken in implementing regulations 
additional uncertainty regarding the effect of the dodd frank act exists due to the potential for additional legislative changes to the dodd frank act 
the corporation  as well as the broader financial services industry  is continuing to assess the potential impact of the dodd frank act on its business and operations  but at this stage  the extent of the impact cannot be determined with any degree of certainty 
however  the corporation is likely to be impacted by the dodd frank act in the areas of corporate governance  deposit insurance assessments  capital requirements  risk management  stress testing  and regulation under consumer protection laws 
summary financial results the corporation generates the majority of its revenue through net interest income  or the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
growth in net interest income is dependent upon balance sheet growth and or maintaining or increasing the net interest margin  which is net interest income fully taxable equivalent as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
the corporation also generates revenue through fees earned on the various services and products offered to its customers and through gains on sales of assets  such as loans  investments  or properties 
offsetting these revenue sources are provisions for credit losses on loans  operating expenses and income taxes

table of contents geographically  the million  or  increase in commercial mortgages was within the corporation s pennsylvania million  or  maryland million  or  new jersey million  or and virginia million  or markets 
the million  or  increase in residential mortgages was largely due to the corporation s retention in portfolio of certain and year fixed rate mortgages and certain adjustable rate mortgages with longer initial repricing terms 
the majority of these loans were underwritten to the standards required for sale to third party investors  however  the corporation elected to retain them in portfolio to partially mitigate the impact of decreases in average interest earning assets 
the million  or decrease in construction loans was primarily due to efforts to decrease credit exposure in this portfolio as new loan originations decreased during the current year 
in addition  million of charge offs recorded in contributed to the decrease 
geographically  the decline was primarily in the corporation s maryland million  or  virginia million  or and new jersey million  or markets 
the average yield on loans during of represented a basis point  or  decrease in comparison to  despite the average prime rate remaining at for both and the decrease in average yields on loans was attributable to repayments of higher yielding loans and declining average rates on fixed and adjustable rate loans which  unlike floating rate loans  have a lagged repricing effect 
in addition  approximately one third of the floating rate portfolio is based on an index rate other than prime  such as the one month london interbank offering rate  or libor  which decreased on average from to average investments decreased million  or  due largely to maturities of mortgage backed securities  state and municipal securities and us government sponsored agency securities  partially offset by an increase in collateralized mortgage obligations

the decrease in customer certificates of deposit was in accounts with original maturity terms of less than one year of million  or  partially offset by an increase in accounts with original maturity terms of greater than one year of million  or 
as noted above  the decrease in short term customer certificates of deposit was largely due to customers migrating funds to interest bearing savings and demand accounts in anticipation of rising rates 
the growth in longer term certificates of deposit was due to the corporation s continuing focus on building customer relationships  while at the same time extending funding maturities at reasonable rates over a longer time horizon 
the decrease in brokered certificates of deposit occurred because the significant growth in customer funding reduced the need for non core funding alternatives 
the average cost of interest bearing deposits decreased basis points  or  from in to in  primarily due to the maturities of higher rate certificates of deposit

the average yield on investment securities decreased basis points  or  from in to in as purchases were at yields that were lower than the overall portfolio yield 
investment yields were also adversely impacted by the reduction or in some cases the suspension of  dividends on equity securities  particularly financial institution stocks and fhlb stocks

the increase in salaries was due to a million increase in incentive compensation expense for subsidiary bank management 
although merit increases were suspended as of march  the remaining increase in salary expense reflects the impact of merit increases granted prior to the salary freeze 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in average full time equivalent employees from  in to  in the increase in employee benefits was primarily due to a million  or  increase in healthcare costs as claims increased  a million increase in defined benefit pension plan expense due to a lower return on plan assets and million in severance expense primarily related to the consolidation of back office functions at the corporation s columbia bank subsidiary 
these increases were offset by a  decrease in accruals for compensated absences and a  decrease in postretirement plan expense due to a reduction in benefits covered

total liabilities decreased million  or  due to a decrease in borrowings  partially offset by an increase in deposits 
during  soft loan demand and a lack of attractive investment alternatives resulting from the low interest rate environment prevented the corporation from effectively utilizing funds generated by the maturities of investment securities and deposit growth 
as a result  excess funds were used to reduce wholesale funding in the form of short and long term borrowings

the net unrealized gain on available for sale investment securities at december  was million  compared to a net unrealized gain of million as of december  during  improvements in the fair values of corporate debt securities  mainly as a result of unrealized losses on pooled trust preferred securities being realized through other than temporary impairment charges recorded in  were partially offset by a decrease in holding gains on collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities and an increase in holding losses on arcs 
loans the following table presents loans outstanding  by type  as of the dates shown december in thousands real estate commercial mortgage commercial industrial  financial and agricultural real estate home equity real estate residential mortgage real estate construction consumer leasing and other gross loans unearned income loans  net of unearned income total loans  net of unearned income  decreased million  or  mainly due to a combination of lower demand and continuing efforts to manage credit exposures 
construction loans decreased million  or  due to efforts by the corporation to reduce 
table of contents credit exposure in this sector  and million in construction loan charge offs during offsetting this decrease was an million  or  increase in commercial mortgages and a million  or  increase in residential mortgages 
during  continued weak economic conditions hampered overall commercial loan and commercial mortgage loan growth 
the increase in residential mortgages was largely due to the corporation s retention in portfolio of certain and year fixed rate mortgages and certain adjustable rate mortgages with longer initial repricing terms 
the majority of these loans were underwritten to the standards required for sale to third party investors  however  the corporation elected to retain them in portfolio to partially mitigate the impact of a decrease in interest earning assets 
approximately billion  or  of the corporation s loan portfolio was in commercial mortgage and construction loans as of december  the corporation does not have a concentration of credit risk with any single borrower  industry or geographical location 
however  the performance of real estate markets and general economic conditions adversely impacted the performance of these loans throughout other assets cash and due from banks decreased million  or  as balances on deposit with the federal reserve bank  totaling million at december   were reclassified to interest bearing deposits during other earning assets increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in interest bearing deposits with other banks as a result of the reclassification of the federal reserve bank balances discussed above  which had declined to million at december  premises and equipment increased million  or  to million 
the increase reflects additions primarily for the construction of new branch facilities  offset by depreciation and the sales of branch and office facilities during goodwill and intangible assets decreased million  or  due to the amortization of intangible assets 
other assets increased million  or  to million due primarily to million of investment securities sales that had not settled as of december   a million increase in low and moderate income housing partnership investments  a million increase in oreo and a million increase in net mortgage servicing rights  partially offset by an million decrease in prepaid fdic assessments  which were amortized to expense in deposits and borrowings deposits increased million  or  to billion as of december  during  total non interest and interest bearing demand and savings deposits increased  or  and time deposits decreased million  or 
the increase in non interest bearing accounts was in business accounts  while the increase in interest bearing accounts was in personal and municipal accounts 
growth in business accounts was due  in part  to businesses being required to keep higher balances on hand to offset service fees  as well as a migration away from the corporation s cash management products due to low interest rates 
the increase in personal accounts was primarily due to a reduction in consumer spending and a reduction in customer certificates of deposit 
the decrease in time deposits resulted from a million  or  decrease in customer certificates of deposit and an million  or  decrease in brokered certificates of deposit 
the decrease in customer certificates of deposit was in accounts with original maturity terms of less than one year of million  or  partially offset by an increase in accounts with original maturity terms of greater than one year of million  or 
short term borrowings decreased million  or  due to a decrease in federal funds purchased of million and short term customer funding of million 
long term debt decreased million  or  as a result of the maturity of fhlb advances 
other liabilities other liabilities increased million  or 
the increase was primarily due to a million of investment security purchases executed prior to december   but not settled until after december  shareholders equity total shareholders equity decreased million  or  to billion  or of total assets as of december  the decrease was due to the redemption of million of preferred stock and the million repurchase of the outstanding common 
table of contents stock warrant  both previously held by the ust  and million of dividends on common and preferred shares 
partially offsetting these decreases were million of net proceeds received in connection with the corporation s common stock offering in may and million of net income 
on december   the corporation entered into a securities purchase agreement with the ust pursuant to which the corporation sold to the ust  for an aggregate purchase price of million   shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a preferred stock  par value  per share  and a warrant to purchase up to million shares of common stock  par value per share 
at issuance  the million of proceeds was allocated to the preferred stock and the warrant based on their relative fair values million was allocated to the preferred stock and million to the warrant 
the fair value of the preferred stock was estimated using a discounted cash flows model assuming a discount rate and a five year term 
the difference between the initial value allocated to the preferred stock of approximately million and the liquidation value of million was charged to retained earnings as an adjustment to the dividend yield using the effective yield method 
on may   the corporation issued million shares of its common stock  in an underwritten public offering  for net proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions 
on july  the corporation redeemed all  outstanding shares of its series a preferred stock with a total payment to the ust of million  consisting of million of principal and million of dividends 
the preferred stock had a carrying value of million on the redemption date 
upon redemption  the remaining million preferred stock discount was recorded as a reduction to net income available to common shareholders 
on september   the corporation repurchased the outstanding common stock warrant for the purchase of million shares of its common stock  for million  completing the corporation s participation in the ust s cpp 
upon repurchase  the common stock warrant had a carrying value of million 
the repurchase price of million was recorded as a reduction to additional paid in capital on the statement of shareholders equity and comprehensive income 
the corporation and its subsidiary banks are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by various banking regulators 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
the regulations require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and tier i capital to average assets as defined 
as of december   the corporation and each of its bank subsidiaries met the minimum capital requirements 
in addition  all of the corporation s bank subsidiaries capital ratios exceeded the amounts required to be considered well capitalized as defined in the regulations

the basel committee on banking supervision basel is a committee of central banks and bank regulators from major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country s regulators with the purpose of ensuring that financial institutions have adequate capital given the risk levels of assets and off balance sheet financial instruments 
in december   basel released a framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation  referred to as basel iii 
basel iii includes defined minimum capital ratios  which must be met when implementation occurs on january  an additional 
table of contents capital conservation buffer will be phased in beginning january  and  when fully phased in three years later  the minimum ratios will be higher 
fully phased in capital standards under basel iii will require banks to maintain more capital than the minimum levels required under current regulatory capital standards 
the us banking regulators have not yet proposed regulations implementing basel iii  but are expected to do so in the near future 
as of december   the corporation met the fully phased in minimum capital ratios required for each of the capital measures included in basel iii 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the corporation has various financial obligations that require future cash payments 
these obligations include the payment of liabilities recorded on the corporation s consolidated balance sheet as well as contractual obligations for purchased services or for operating leases 
the following table summarizes significant contractual obligations to third parties  by type  that were fixed and determinable as of december  payments due in one year or less one to three years three to five years over five years total in thousands deposits with no stated maturity time deposits short term borrowings long term debt operating leases purchase obligations uncertain tax positions includes demand deposits and savings accounts  which can be withdrawn by customers at any time

in addition to the contractual obligations listed in the preceding table  the corporation is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk that are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the financial or performance obligation of a customer to a third party 
commitments and standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash needs as they may expire without being drawn

table of contents critical accounting policies the following is a summary of those accounting policies that the corporation considers to be most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  as they require management s most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
fair value measurements the disclosure of fair value measurements is required by fasb asc topic  which establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following three categories from highest to lowest priority level inputs that represent quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level inputs that represent quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  or quoted prices for identical instruments in non active markets 
also includes valuation techniques whose inputs are derived principally from observable market data other than quoted prices  such as interest rates or other market corroborated means 
level inputs that are largely unobservable  as little or no market data exists for the instrument being valued 
the corporation has categorized all assets and liabilities measured at fair value both on a recurring and nonrecurring basis into the above three levels 
see note p  fair value measurements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the disclosures required by fasb asc topic the determination of fair value for assets and liabilities categorized as level items involves a great deal of subjectivity due to the use of unobservable inputs 
in addition  determining when a market is no longer active and placing little or no reliance on distressed market prices requires the use of management s judgment 
the need for greater management judgment in determining fair values for level assets and liabilities has further been heightened by current economic conditions  which have created volatility in the fair values of certain investment securities 
the corporation engages third party valuation experts to assist in valuing most available for sale investment securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis which are classified as level or level items 
the pricing data and market quotes the corporation obtains from outside sources are reviewed internally for reasonableness 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans 
the reserve for unfunded lending commitments represents management s estimate of losses inherent in its unfunded loan commitments and is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
the allowance for credit losses is increased by charges to expense  through the provision for credit losses  and decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments are adequate as of the balance sheet date  however  future changes to the allowance or reserve may be necessary based on changes in any of the factors discussed in the following paragraphs 
maintaining an adequate allowance for credit losses is dependent upon various factors  including the ability to identify potential problem loans in a timely manner 
for commercial loans  commercial mortgages and construction loans  an internal risk rating process  consisting of nine general classifications ranging from excellent to loss  is used 
risk ratings are initially assigned to loans by loan officers and are reviewed on a regular basis by loan review staff 
ratings will change if the ongoing monitoring procedures or specific loan review activities identify a deterioration or an improvement in the loan 
while assigning risk ratings involves judgment  the risk rating process allows management to identify riskier credits in a timely manner and to allocate resources to managing troubled accounts 
the risk rating process is not practical for residential mortgages  home equity loans  consumer loans  installment loans and lease receivables  mainly because these portfolios consist of a larger number of loans with smaller balances 
instead  these portfolios are evaluated for risk mainly based on aggregate payment history  through the monitoring of delinquency levels and trends 
the corporation s established methodology for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses considers both components of the allowance specific allowances allocated to loans evaluated individually for impairment under fasb asc section  and allowances calculated for pools of loans evaluated collectively for impairment under fasb asc subtopic a loan evaluated individually for impairment is considered to be impaired if the corporation believes it is probable that all amounts will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans are required to be measured based on the 
table of contents present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or at the loan s observable market price or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the fair value of collateral is generally based on appraisals  discounted to arrive at expected sale prices  net of estimated selling costs 
an allowance for loan losses is allocated to an impaired loan if its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
in addition  a reserve for unfunded lending commitments may be allocated for impaired loans with unused commitments to extend credit 
as of december  and  substantially all of the corporation s impaired loans were measured based on the estimated fair value of each loan s collateral 
collateral could be in the form of real estate  in the case of impaired commercial mortgages and construction loans  or business assets  such as accounts receivable or inventory  in the case of commercial and industrial loans 
commercial and industrial loans may also be secured by real property 
for loans secured by real estate  estimated fair values are determined primarily through certified third party appraisals 
when a real estate secured loan becomes impaired  a decision is made regarding whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary 
this decision is based on various considerations  including the age of the most recent appraisal  the loan to value ratio based on the original appraisal  the condition of the property  the corporation s experience and knowledge of the market  the purpose of the loan  environmental factors  payment status  the strength of any guarantors  and the existence and age of other indications of value such as broker price opinions  among others 
as of december  and  approximately and  respectively  of impaired loans secured by real estate with principal balances greater than million were measured at estimated fair value using certified third party appraisals that had been updated within the preceding months 
appraised values are discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral  which is considered to be the estimated fair value 
the discounts also include estimated costs to sell the property 
where updated certified appraisals are not obtained for loans individually evaluated for impairment that are secured by real estate  fair values are estimated based on one or more of the following original appraisal if the original appraisal indicated a very strong loan to value position and  in the opinion of the corporation s internal loan evaluation staff  there has not been a significant deterioration in the collateral value  the original appraisal may be used to support the value of the collateral 
appropriate discounts are applied to the appraised value to adjust for market changes since the date the appraisal was completed  to arrive at an estimated selling price for the collateral 
original appraisals are typically used only when the estimated collateral value  as adjusted  results in a current loan to value ratio that is lower than the corporation s policy for new loans  generally 
broker price opinions in lieu of obtaining an updated certified appraisal  a less formal indication of value  such as a broker price opinion  may be obtained 
these opinions are generally used to validate internal estimates of collateral value and are not relied upon as the sole determinant of fair value 
discounted cash flows while substantially all of the corporation s impaired loans are measured based on the estimated fair value of collateral  discounted cash flows analyses may be used to validate estimates of collateral value derived from other approaches 
for loans secured by non real estate collateral  such as accounts receivable or inventory  estimated fair values are determined based on borrower financial statements  inventory listings  accounts receivable agings or borrowing base certificates 
indications of value from these sources are generally discounted based on the age of the financial information or the quality of the assets 
liquidation or collection discounts are applied to these assets based upon existing loan evaluation policies 
all loans not evaluated individually for impairment are evaluated collectively for impairment  using a pooled loss evaluation approach 
in general  these loans include residential mortgages  home equity loans  consumer loans  and lease receivables 
certain commercial loans  commercial mortgages and construction loans are also evaluated collectively for impairment 
the corporation evaluates loans collectively for impairment through the following procedures the loans are segmented into pools with similar characteristics  such as general loan type  secured or unsecured and type of collateral 
commercial loans  commercial mortgages and construction loans are further segmented into separate pools based on internally assigned risk ratings 
a loss rate is calculated based on historical loss experience 
typically  this rate is based on actual losses for the most recent four years  with more recent years weighted more heavily 
the loss rate is adjusted to consider qualitative factors  such as economic conditions and trends 

table of contents the resulting adjusted loss rate is applied to the balance of the loans in the pool to arrive at the allowance allocation for the pool 
the allocation of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed to evaluate its appropriateness in relation to the overall risk profile of the loan portfolio 
the corporation considers risk factors such as local and national economic conditions  trends in delinquencies and non accrual loans  the diversity of borrower industry types  and the composition of the portfolio by loan type 
an unallocated allowance is maintained for factors and conditions that exist at the balance sheet date  but are not specifically identifiable  and to recognize the inherent imprecision in estimating and measuring loss exposure 
over the past two years  the corporation has made changes to its allowance methodology which have expanded the number of loans evaluated collectively for impairment and reduced the number of loans evaluated individually for impairment 
effective december   the allowance methodology was revised to evaluate commercial loans  commercial mortgages and construction loans that were rated satisfactory minus or special mention collectively for impairment as opposed to evaluating these loans individually for impairment 
the methodology was changed to more properly align internal risk ratings with the likelihood of impairment 
effective december   the corporation revised its allowance methodology to evaluate certain accruing commercial loans  commercial mortgages and construction loans rated substandard collectively for impairment as opposed to evaluating these loans individually for impairment 
these accruing substandard rated loans in the corporation s portfolio did not meet the definition of impairment and had no related specific allowance allocation 
approximately million of loans that were previously evaluated individually for impairment were collectively evaluated for impairment  resulting in an additional million of allowance allocations as of december  loans and lease financing receivables deemed to be a loss are written off through a charge against the allowance for credit losses 
closed end consumer loans are generally charged off when they become days past due days for open end consumer loans if they are not adequately secured by real estate 
all other loans are evaluated for possible charge off when it is probable that the balance will not be collected  based on the ability of the borrower to pay and the value of the underlying collateral 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are recorded as increases to the allowance for loan losses 
past due status is determined based on contractual due dates for loan payments 
see also note d  loans and allowance for credit losses in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
business combinations and intangible assets the corporation accounts for all business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
purchase accounting requires the purchase price to be allocated to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including certain intangible assets that must be recognized 
typically  this allocation results in the purchase price exceeding the fair value of net assets acquired  which is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized to expense  but is tested at least annually for impairment 
the corporation completes its annual goodwill impairment test as of october st of each year 
the corporation tests for impairment by first allocating its goodwill and other assets and liabilities  as necessary  to defined reporting units 
a fair value is then determined for each reporting unit 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of the recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair values are less than the book values  an additional valuation procedure is necessary to assess the proper carrying value of the goodwill 
the corporation determined that no impairment write offs were necessary in or in  the corporation recorded a million goodwill impairment charge for one of its defined reporting units  based on the results of the annual goodwill impairment test 
for additional details related to the goodwill impairment test  see note f  goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
reporting unit valuation is inherently subjective  with a number of factors based on assumptions and management judgments 
among these are future growth rates for the reporting units  selection of comparable market transactions  discount rates and earnings capitalization rates 
changes in assumptions and results due to economic conditions  industry factors and reporting unit performance and cash flow projections could result in different assessments of the fair values of reporting units and could result in impairment charges 
if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  an interim impairment test is required 
such events may include adverse changes in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse actions by a regulator  unauthorized competition  the loss of key employees  or similar events 

table of contents intangible assets are amortized over their estimated lives 
some intangible assets have indefinite lives and are  therefore  not amortized 
all intangible assets must be evaluated for impairment if certain events occur 
any impairment write downs are recognized as expense on the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon income before income taxes  adjusted for the effect of certain tax exempt income and non deductible expenses 
in addition  certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate 
the corporation must also evaluate the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if any such assets are more likely than not to not be recovered  a valuation allowance must be recognized 
the corporation recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  for certain state net operating losses that are not expected to be recovered 
the assessment of the carrying value of deferred tax assets is based on certain assumptions  changes in which could have a material impact on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
the corporation accounts for uncertain tax positions by applying a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
recognition and measurement of tax positions is based on management s evaluations of relevant tax code and appropriate industry information about audit proceedings for comparable positions at other organizations 
virtually all of the corporation s unrecognized tax benefits are for positions that are taken on an annual basis on state tax returns 
increases to unrecognized tax benefits will occur as a result of accruing for the nonrecognition of the position for the current year 
decreases will occur as a result of the lapsing of the statute of limitations for the oldest outstanding year which includes the position

the disclosure requirements of asc update related to troubled debt restructurings will impact the corporation s disclosures  however  it will not impact how the corporation measures its allowance for credit losses

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to economic loss that arises from changes in the values of certain financial instruments 
the types of market risk exposures generally faced by financial institutions include interest rate risk  equity market price risk  debt security market price risk  foreign currency risk and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of its operations  only equity market price risk  debt security market price risk and interest rate risk are significant to the corporation 
equity market price risk equity market price risk is the risk that changes in the values of equity investments could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
as of december   the corporation s equity investments consisted of million of federal home loan bank fhlb and federal reserve bank stock  million of common stocks of publicly traded financial institutions and million of other equity investments 
the equity investments most susceptible to market price risk are the financial institutions stocks  which had a cost basis of million and a fair value of million as of december  gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses in this portfolio were approximately million and  as of december   respectively 
the corporation has evaluated whether any unrealized losses on individual equity investments constituted other than temporary impairment  which would require a write down through a charge to earnings 
based on the results of such evaluations  the corporation recorded write downs of million in  million in  and million in for financial institutions stocks which were deemed to exhibit other than temporary impairment in value 
in  the corporation recorded a  other than temporary impairment charge for a mutual fund investment 
in  the corporation recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million and  for a mutual fund investment and other government agency sponsored stocks  respectively 
additional impairment charges may be necessary depending upon the performance of the equity markets in general and the performance of the individual investments held by the corporation 
see also note c  investment securities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management continuously monitors the fair value of its equity investments and evaluates current market conditions and operating results of the issuers 
periodic sale and purchase decisions are made based on this monitoring process 
none of the corporation s equity securities are classified as trading 
future cash flows from these investments are not provided in the table on page as such investments do not have maturity dates 
another source of equity market price risk is the corporation s investment in fhlb stock  which the corporation is required to own in order to borrow from the fhlb 
as of december   the corporation s investment in fhlb stock was million 
fhlbs obtain funding primarily through the issuance of consolidated obligations of the federal home loan bank system 
the us government does not guarantee these obligations  and each of the fhlb banks is  generally  jointly and severally liable for repayment of each other s debt 
the fhlb system has experienced financial stress  and some of the regional banks within the fhlb system have suspended or reduced their dividends  or eliminated the ability of members to redeem capital stock 
the corporation s fhlb stock and its ability to obtain fhlb funds could be adversely impacted if the financial health of the fhlb system worsens 
in addition to its equity portfolio  the corporation s investment management and trust services revenue is impacted by fluctuations in the securities markets 
a portion of the corporation s trust and brokerage revenue is based on the value of the underlying investment portfolios 
if the values of those investment portfolios decrease  whether due to factors influencing us securities markets in general  or otherwise  the corporation s revenue would be negatively impacted 
in addition  the corporation s ability to sell its brokerage services in the future will be dependent  in part  upon consumers level of confidence in equity markets 
debt security market price risk debt security market price risk is the risk that changes in the values of debt securities could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
the corporation s debt securities consist primarily of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations whose principal payments are guaranteed by us government sponsored agencies  state and municipal securities  us government sponsored agency securities  us government debt securities  auction rate certificates and corporate debt securities 
the corporation s investments in certain municipal securities  auction rate certificates and corporate debt securities are most susceptible to market price risk 
municipal securities as of december   the corporation had million of municipal securities issued by various municipalities in its investment portfolio 
ongoing uncertainty with respect to the financial viability of municipal insurers places much greater emphasis on 
table of contents the underlying strength of issuers 
increasing pressure on local tax revenues of issuers due to adverse economic conditions could also have an adverse impact on the underlying credit quality of issuers 
the corporation evaluates existing and potential holdings primarily on the underlying credit worthiness of the issuing municipality and then  to a lesser extent  on the credit enhancement corresponding to the individual issuance 
as of december   approximately of municipal securities were supported by the general obligation of corresponding municipalities 
in addition  approximately of these securities were school district issuances that are supported by the general obligation of the corresponding municipalities  as of december  auction rate certificates as of december   the corporation s investments in student loan auction rate securities  also known as auction rate certificates arcs  had a cost basis of million and a fair value of million  or of total assets 
arcs are long term securities that were structured to allow their sale in periodic auctions  resulting in both the treatment of arcs as short term instruments in normal market conditions and fair values that could be derived based on periodic auction prices 
however  beginning in  market auctions for these securities began to fail due to an insufficient number of buyers  resulting in an illiquid market 
this illiquidity has resulted in recent market prices that were based on trades that were not regular or orderly transactions  therefore  providing an inaccurate basis for fair value 
therefore  as of december   the fair values of the arcs were derived using significant unobservable inputs based on an expected cash flows model which produced fair values which were materially different from those that would be expected from settlement of these investments in the illiquid market that presently exists 
the expected cash flows model  prepared by a third party valuation expert  produced fair values which assumed a return to market liquidity sometime within the next three years 
the credit quality of the underlying debt associated with the arcs is also a factor in the determination of their estimated fair value 
as of december   approximately million  or  of the arcs were rated above investment grade  with approximately million  or  aaa rated 
approximately million  or  of arcs were not rated or rated below investment grade by at least one ratings agency 
of this amount  approximately million  or  of the loans underlying the arcs have principal payments which are guaranteed by the federal government 
in total  approximately million  or  of the loans underlying the arcs have principal payments which are guaranteed by the federal government 
at december   all arcs were current and making scheduled interest payments 
corporate debt securities the corporation holds corporate debt securities in the form of pooled trust preferred securities  single issuer trust preferred securities and subordinated debt issued by financial institutions  as presented in the following table december  amortized cost estimated fair value in thousands single issuer trust preferred securities subordinated debt pooled trust preferred securities total corporate debt securities issued by financial institutions the fair values for pooled trust preferred securities and certain single issuer trust preferred securities were based on quotes provided by third party brokers who determined fair values based predominantly on internal valuation models which were not indicative prices or binding offers 
the corporation s investments in single issuer trust preferred securities had an unrealized loss of million as of december  the corporation did not record any other than temporary impairment charges for single issuer trust preferred securities in  or the corporation held single issuer trust preferred securities that were rated below investment grade by at least one ratings agency  with an amortized cost of million and an estimated fair value of million as of december  the majority of the single issuer trust preferred securities rated below investment grade were rated bb 
single issuer trust preferred securities with an amortized cost of million and an estimated fair value of million as of december   were not rated by any ratings agency 

table of contents the corporation held ten pooled trust preferred securities as of december  nine of these securities  with an amortized cost of million and an estimated fair value of million  were rated below investment grade by at least one ratings agency  with ratings ranging from c to caa 
for each of the nine pooled trust preferred securities rated below investment grade  the class of securities held by the corporation was below the most senior tranche  with the corporation s interests being subordinate to other investors in the pool 
the corporation determines the fair value of pooled trust preferred securities based on quotes provided by third party brokers 
the amortized cost of pooled trust preferred securities is the purchase price of the securities  net of cumulative credit related other than temporary impairment charges  determined using an expected cash flows model 
the most significant input to the expected cash flows model is the expected payment deferral rate for each pooled trust preferred security 
the corporation evaluates the financial metrics  such as capital ratios and non performing asset ratios  of the individual financial institution issuers that comprise each pooled trust preferred security to estimate its expected deferral rate 
the actual weighted average cumulative defaults and deferrals as a percentage of original collateral were approximately as of december  the discounted cash flows modeling for pooled trust preferred securities held by the corporation as of december  assumed  on average  an additional expected deferral rate 
additional impairment charges for corporate debt securities issued by financial institutions may be necessary in the future depending upon the performance of the individual investments held by the corporation 
see note c  investment securities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion related to the corporation s other than temporary impairment evaluations for debt securities and see note p  fair value measurements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion related to the fair values of debt securities 
interest rate risk  asset liability management and liquidity interest rate risk creates exposure in two primary areas 
first  changes in rates have an impact on the corporation s liquidity position and could affect its ability to meet obligations and continue to grow 
second  movements in interest rates can create fluctuations in the corporation s net interest income and changes in the economic value of its equity 
the corporation employs various management techniques to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk 
an asset liability management committee alco  consisting of key financial and senior management personnel  meets on a periodic basis 
the alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the corporation  approving asset and liability management policies  and overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies regarding balance sheet positions and earnings 
from a liquidity standpoint  the corporation must maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets to meet the cash needs of its customers  who  as depositors  may want to withdraw funds or who  as borrowers  need credit availability 
liquidity is provided on a continuous basis through scheduled and unscheduled principal and interest payments on outstanding loans and investments and through the availability of deposits and borrowings 
the corporation also maintains secondary sources that provide liquidity on a secured and unsecured basis to meet short term and long term needs 
the consolidated statements of cash flows provide details related to the corporation s sources and uses of cash 
the corporation generated million in cash from operating activities during  mainly due to net income  as adjusted for non cash charges  most notably the provision for credit losses 
investing activities resulted in net cash proceeds of million in due to sales and maturities of investments exceeding reinvestments in the portfolio and a net increase in loans 
financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million in as a result of repayments of short term borrowings and long term debt and the redemption of preferred stock exceeding cash inflows from deposit increases and the common stock offering 
liquidity must also be managed at the fulton financial corporation parent company level 
for safety and soundness reasons  banking regulations limit the amount of cash that can be transferred from subsidiary banks to the parent company in the form of loans and dividends 
generally  these limitations are based on the subsidiary banks regulatory capital levels and their net income 
the parent company meets its cash needs through dividends and loans from subsidiary banks  and through external borrowings  if necessary 
management continuously monitors the liquidity and capital needs of the parent company and will implement appropriate strategies  as necessary  to meet regulatory capital requirements and to meet its cash needs 
as of december   liquid assets defined as cash and due from banks  short term investments  deposits in other financial institutions  federal funds sold  mortgages available for sale  securities available for sale  and non mortgage backed securities held to maturity due in one year or less totaled billion  or of total assets  as compared to billion  or of total assets  as of december  
table of contents the following tables present the expected maturities of investment securities as of december  and the weighted average yields of such securities calculated based on historical cost held to maturity at amortized cost maturing within one year after one but within five years after five but within ten years after ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us government sponsored agency securities state and municipal total mortgage backed securities available for sale at estimated fair value maturing within one year after one but within five years after five but within ten years after ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us government securities us government sponsored agency securities state and municipal auction rate securities corporate debt securities total collateralized mortgage obligations mortgage backed securities weighted average yields on tax exempt securities have been computed on a fully taxable equivalent basis assuming a tax rate of and statutory interest expense disallowances 
maturities for mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are dependent upon the interest rate environment and prepayments on the underlying loans 
for the purpose of this table  the entire balance and weighted average rate is shown in one period 
includes small business administration securities  whose maturities are dependent upon prepayments on the underlying loans 
for the purpose of this table  amounts are based upon contractual maturities 
maturities of auction rate securities are based on contractual maturities 
the corporation s investment portfolio consists mainly of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations which have stated maturities that may differ from actual maturities due to borrowers ability to prepay obligations 
cash flows from such investments are dependent upon the performance of the underlying mortgage loans and are generally influenced by the level of interest rates 
as rates increase  cash flows generally decrease as prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans decrease 
as rates decrease  cash flows generally increase as prepayments increase

each of the corporation s subsidiary banks is a member of the fhlb and has access to fhlb overnight and term credit facilities 
as of december   the corporation had million of term advances outstanding from the fhlb with an additional billion borrowing capacity under these facilities 
this availability  along with federal funds lines at various correspondent banks  provides the corporation with additional liquidity 
a combination of commercial real estate loans  commercial loans and securities are pledged to the federal reserve bank of philadelphia to provide access to the federal reserve bank discount window borrowings 
as of december   the corporation had billion of collateralized borrowing availability at the discount window and term auction facility and no outstanding borrowings

included within the billion of floating rate loans above are billion of loans  or of the total  that float with the prime interest rate  billion  or  of loans which float with other interest rates  primarily the london interbank offering rate libor  and billion  or  of adjustable rate loans 
the billion of adjustable rate loans include loans that are fixed rate instruments for a certain period of time  and then convert to floating rates 

table of contents the following table presents the percentage of adjustable rate loans  at december   stratified by the period until their next repricing fixed rate term percent of total adjustable rate loans one year two years three years four years five years greater than five years the corporation uses three complementary methods to measure and manage interest rate risk 
they are static gap analysis  simulation of earnings  and estimates of economic value of equity 
using these measurements in tandem provides a reasonably comprehensive summary of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the corporation  level of risk as time evolves  and exposure to changes in interest rates 
static gap provides a measurement of repricing risk in the corporation s balance sheet as of a point in time 
this measurement is accomplished through stratification of the corporation s assets and liabilities into repricing periods 
the sum of assets and liabilities in each of these periods are compared for mismatches within that maturity segment 
core deposits having no contractual maturities are placed into repricing periods based upon historical balance performance 
repricing for mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations includes the effect of expected cash flows 
expected prepayment effects are applied to these balances based upon industry projections for prepayment speeds 
the corporation s policy limits the cumulative six month ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities rsa rsl to a range of to 
as of december   the cumulative six month ratio of rsa rsl was 
simulation of net interest income and net income is performed for the next twelve month period 
a variety of interest rate scenarios are used to measure the effects of sudden and gradual movements upward and downward in the yield curve 
these results are compared to the results obtained in a flat or unchanged interest rate scenario 
simulation of earnings is used primarily to measure the corporation s short term earnings exposure to interest rate movements 
the corporation s policy limits the potential exposure of net interest income to of the base case net interest income for a basis point shock in interest rates  for a basis point shock and for a basis point shock 
a shock is an immediate upward or downward movement of interest rates across the yield curve 
the shocks do not take into account changes in customer behavior that could result in changes to mix and or volumes in the balance sheet nor do they account for competitive pricing over the forward month period 
the following table summarizes the expected impact of interest rate shocks on net interest income due to the current level of interest rates  the and basis point downward shock scenarios are not shown rate shock annual change in net interest income change bp million bp million bp million bp million because certain current short term interest rates are at or below  the basis point downward shock assumes that corresponding short term interest rates approach an implied floor that  in effect  reflects a decrease of less than the full basis point downward shock 
economic value of equity estimates the discounted present value of asset and liability cash flows 
discount rates are based upon market prices for like assets and liabilities 
upward and downward shocks of interest rates are used to determine the comparative effect of such interest rate movements relative to the unchanged environment 
this measurement tool is used primarily to evaluate the longer term repricing risks and options in the corporation s balance sheet 
a policy limit of of economic equity may be at risk for every basis point shock movement in interest rates 
as of december   the corporation was within economic value of equity policy limits for every basis point shock movement in interest rates
