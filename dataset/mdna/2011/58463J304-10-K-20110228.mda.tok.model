item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we were incorporated in maryland on august  primarily for the purpose of investing in and owning net leased healthcare facilities across the united states 
we also make real estate mortgage loans and other loans to our tenants 
we conduct our business operations in one segment 
we have operated as a reit since april   and accordingly  elected reit status upon the filing in september of our calendar year federal income tax return 
our existing tenants are  and our prospective tenants will generally be  healthcare operating companies and other healthcare providers that use substantial real estate assets in their operations 
we offer financing for these operators real estate through lease and mortgage financing and generally seek lease and loan terms on a long term basis ranging from to years with a series of shorter renewal terms at the option of our tenants and borrowers 
we also have included and intend to include in our lease and loan agreements annual contractual minimum rate increases 
our existing portfolio minimum escalators range from to  while a limited number of our properties do not have an escalator 
most of our leases and loans also include rate increases based on the general rate of inflation if greater than the minimum contractual increases 
in addition to the base rent  our leases require our tenants to pay all operating costs and expenses associated with the facility 
some leases also require our tenants to pay percentage rents  which are based on the level of those tenants revenues from their operations 
finally  from time to time we acquire a profits or other equity interest in our tenants that gives us a limited right to share in the tenant s positive cash flow 
we selectively make loans to certain of our operators through our taxable reit subsidiaries  which they use for acquisitions and working capital 
we consider our lending business an important element of our overall business strategy for two primary reasons it provides opportunities to make income earning investments that yield attractive risk adjusted returns in an industry in which our management has expertise  and by making debt capital available to certain qualified operators  we believe we create for our company a competitive advantage over other buyers of  and financing sources for  healthcare facilities 

table of contents at december   our portfolio consisted of properties healthcare facilities of the we own are leased to tenants with the remainder in the form of mortgage loans collateralized by interests in health care real estate 
the following is a discussion of our highlights for the years ended december   and  which should be read in conjunction with the financial statements appearing in item of this annual report on form k 
highlights in  our primary business goals were to recapitalize our balance sheet with longer term debt and lower leverage  increase our access to liquidity and accelerate our acquisitions of healthcare real estate 
we took the following actions to achieve these goals among others replaced old million credit facility with a new million credit facility and completed a million stock offering  establishing a low leverage platform with more than million of available capital for acquisition growth  purchased million of our senior notes  leaving only million of the exchangeable notes remaining to be paid by november  paid million term loan maturing in  completely paid down million revolver  committed to more than million in healthcare real estate investments acquired three inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in texas with a new tenant for million  commenced million redevelopment of the river oaks hospital in houston  entered into million agreement to develop phoenix area general acute care hospital  acquired two free standing long term acute care hospitals and a third property in the first quarter  all leased to and operated by rehabcare  the nation s third largest operator of ltachs  for million 
sold our inglewood property for million in cash realizing a million gain  received million in early payment of loans  and received million in early receipt of rent related to transactions with prime  lowering prime concentration to of our total assets  sold our montclair hospital for million in cash realizing a gain of million  sold our sharpstown facility in houston  texas for million in cash realizing a million gain  received pre payment of our marina mortgage loan of million  entered into interest rate swaps to fix million of our senior notes starting october  date on which the interest rate is scheduled to turn variable through the maturity date at a rate of and to fix million of our senior notes  starting july  date on which the interest rate is scheduled to turn variable through maturity date  at a rate of  which will result in a million annual savings on interest expense based on current fixed rate  and recorded a million charge to recognize the estimated impairment of our monroe working capital loan 
highlights in  our primary business goal was to preserve capital during the recent economic and credit crisis 
below are actions taken to achieve that goal along with other highlights for the year issued million shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of million  sold an acute care facility to prime for million  realizing a gain of million  executed a million mortgage loan  of which we advanced million by end of year 
loan is collateralized by prime s desert valley facility 
the purpose of the mortgage loan is to help fund a million expansion and renovation project  
table of contents re leased our bucks county facility within six months of terminating the previous lease on the facility due to tenant defaults  terminated leases on two of our louisiana covington and denham springs facilities but subsequently re leased the denham springs facility with a new operator at similar terms within months of the prior lease termination  entered into an at the market offering  which will allow us to sell up to million in stock and will be used for general corporate purposes  which may from time to time include reduction of our debt balances and investments in healthcare real estate and other assets  and settled the stealth litigation 
highlights in  our primary business goal was to grow and diversify our tenant and geographical concentration 
see below for actions taken to reach this goal along with other highlights for the year completed the acquisition of properties leased to unrelated operators for million 
four of the operators healthsouth corporation  community health systems  inc  iasis healthcare llc and health management associates  inc are publicly reporting companies 
this acquisition significantly improved both our tenant and geographical concentrations 
acquired a long term acute care hospital in detroit  michigan for million and entered into an operating lease with vibra 
acquired three southern california hospital facilities  along with two medical office buildings for approximately million and leased these facilities to prime under long term net leases 
completed the sale of three rehabilitation facilities to vibra realizing proceeds of million 
issued exchangeable notes realizing net proceeds of million and issued million shares of stock  realizing net proceeds of million 
these proceeds along with proceeds from our existing revolving credit facility and the sale of the three rehabilitation facilities were used to fund the acquisitions noted above 
terminated leases on two general acute care hospitals in houston  texas  and one hospital in redding  california due to tenant affiliates hospital partners of america  inc hpa  a multi hospital operating company defaults 
within a few months of lease termination  we re leased the redding facility to a prime affiliate 
the new operator agreed to increase the lease base from million to million and to pay additional rent and profit participation based on the expected future profitability of the new lessee s operations 
critical accounting policies in order to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we must make estimates about certain types of transactions and account balances 
we believe that our estimates of the amount and timing of our revenues  credit losses  fair values either as part of a purchase price allocation or impairment analysis and periodic depreciation of our real estate assets  and stock compensation expense  along with our assessment as to whether an entity that we do business with should be consolidated with our results  have significant effects on our financial statements 
each of these items involves estimates that require us to make subjective judgments 
we rely on our experience  collect historical and current market data  and develop relevant assumptions to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates 
under different conditions or assumptions  materially different amounts could be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
in addition  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment on the use of assumptions as to 
table of contents future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
our accounting estimates include the following revenue recognition we receive income from operating leases based on the fixed  minimum required rents base rents per the lease agreements 
rent revenue from base rents is recorded on the straight line method over the terms of the related lease agreements for new leases and the remaining terms of existing leases for acquired properties 
the straight line method records the periodic average amount of base rent earned over the term of a lease  taking into account contractual rent increases over the lease term 
the straight line method typically has the effect of recording more rent revenue from a lease than a tenant is required to pay early in the term of the lease 
during the later parts of a lease term  this effect reverses with less rent revenue recorded than a tenant is required to pay 
rent revenue as recorded on the straight line method in the consolidated statements of income is presented as two amounts billed rent revenue and straight line revenue 
billed rent revenue is the amount of base rent actually billed to the customer each period as required by the lease 
straight line rent revenue is the difference between rent revenue earned based on the straight line method and the amount recorded as billed rent revenue 
we record the difference between base rent revenues earned and amounts due per the respective lease agreements  as applicable  as an increase or decrease to straight line rent receivable 
certain leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the tenant revenue in excess of specified base amounts thresholds percentage rents 
percentage rents are recognized in the period in which revenue thresholds are met 
rental payments received prior to their recognition as income are classified as deferred revenue 
we may also receive additional rent contingent rent under some leases when the us department of labor consumer price index exceeds the annual minimum percentage increase in the lease 
contingent rents are recorded as billed rent revenue in the period earned 
in instances where we have a profits or other equity interest in our tenant s operations  we record revenue equal to our percentage interest of the tenant s profits  as defined in the lease or tenant s operating agreements  once annual thresholds  if any  are met 
we begin recording base rent income from our development projects when the lessee takes physical possession of the facility  which may be different from the stated start date of the lease 
also  during construction of our development projects  we are generally entitled to accrue rent based on the cost paid during the construction period construction period rent 
we accrue construction period rent as a receivable and deferred revenue during the construction period 
when the lessee takes physical possession of the facility  we begin recognizing the accrued construction period rent on the straight line method over the remaining term of the lease 
we receive interest income from our tenants borrowers on mortgage loans  working capital loans  and other long term loans 
interest income from these loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal outstanding and terms of the loans 
commitment fees received from development and leasing services for lessees are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income over the initial term of an operating lease to produce a constant effective yield on the lease interest method 
commitment and origination fees from lending services are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income over the life of the loan using the interest method 
investments in real estate 
we record investments in real estate at cost  and we capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset 
while our tenants are generally responsible for all operating costs at a facility  to the extent that we incur costs of repairs and maintenance  we expense those costs as incurred 
we compute depreciation using the straight line method over the weighted average useful life of years for buildings and improvements 
when circumstances indicate a possible impairment of the value of our real estate investments  we review the recoverability of the facility s carrying value 
the review of the recoverability is generally based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest charges  from the facility s use and eventual disposition 
our forecast of these cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income  market and other applicable trends  and residual value  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to inability to recover the carrying value of a facility  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the facility 
we do not believe that the value of any of our facilities 
table of contents was impaired at december  or  however  given the highly specialized aspects of our properties no assurance can be given that future impairment charges will not be taken 
acquired real estate purchase price allocation 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase prices of acquired real estate  we utilize a number of sources  including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we record above market and below market in place lease values  if any  for the facilities we own which are based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
we amortize any resulting capitalized above market lease values as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
we amortize any resulting capitalized below market lease values as an increase to rental income over the initial term and any fixed rate renewal periods in the respective leases 
because our strategy to a large degree involves the origination and acquisition of long term lease arrangements at market rates relative to our acquisition costs  we do not expect the above market and below market in place lease values to be significant for many of our anticipated transactions 
we measure the aggregate value of other lease intangible assets to be acquired based on the difference between i the property valued with existing leases adjusted to market rental rates and ii the property valued as if vacant when acquired 
management s estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers eg  discounted cash flow analysis 
factors considered by management in our analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
we also consider information obtained about each targeted facility as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing  and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  which we expect to be about six months depending on specific local market conditions 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  legal costs  and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction 
other intangible assets acquired may include customer relationship intangible values  which are based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each prospective tenant s lease and our overall relationship with that tenant 
characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality  and expectations of lease renewals  including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement  among other factors 
we amortize the value of in place leases to expense over the initial term of the respective leases  which have a weighted average useful life of years at december  the value of customer relationship intangibles  if any  is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases  but in no event will the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building 
if a lease is terminated  the unamortized portion of the in place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense 
at december   we have assigned no value to customer relationship intangibles 
loans loans consist of mortgage loans  working capital loans and other long term loans 
mortgage loans are collateralized by interests in real property 
working capital and other long term loans are generally collateralized by interests in receivables and corporate and individual guarantees 
we record loans at cost 
we evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal for each of our loans to determine whether they are impaired 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of the allowance is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to either the value determined by discounting the 
table of contents expected future cash flows using the loans effective interest rate or to the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
losses from rent receivables a provision for losses on rent receivables including straight line rent receivables is recorded when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected in full 
the provision is an amount which reduces the receivable to its estimated net realizable value based on a determination of the eventual amounts to be collected either from the debtor or from the collateral  if any 
stock based compensation 
during the years ended december    and we recorded million  million  and million  respectively  of expense for share based compensation related to grants of restricted common stock  deferred stock units and other stock based awards 
in and  we granted performance based restricted share awards that vest based on the achievement of certain market conditions as defined by the accounting rules 
market conditions are vesting conditions which are based on our stock price levels or our total shareholder return stock price and dividends compared to an index of other reit stocks 
because these awards vest based on the achievement of these market conditions  we must initially evaluate and estimate the probability of achieving those market conditions in order to determine the fair value of the award and over what period we should recognize stock compensation expense 
in  the compensation committee made awards which are earned only if we achieve certain stock price levels  total shareholder return or other market conditions 
the awards were made pursuant to our multi year incentive plan mip adopted by the compensation committee and consisted of three components service based awards  core performance awards cpre  and superior performance awards spre 
the service based awards vest annually and ratably over a seven year period 
we recognize expense over the vesting period on the straight line method for service based awards 
the cpre and spre awards vest based on the achievement of certain market conditions 
only one third of the spre awards were earned as of december  with the remainder being forfeited  however  these awards require additional service after being earned in order to vest 
for the cpre awards  the period over which the awards are earned is not fixed because the awards provide for cumulative measures over multiple years 
the accounting rules require that we estimate the period over which the awards will likely be earned  regardless of the period over which the award allows as the maximum period over which it can be earned 
also  because some awards have multiple periods over which they can be earned  we must segregate individual awards into tranches  based on their vesting or estimated earning periods 
these complexities required us to use an independent consultant to assist us in modeling both the value of the award and the various periods over which each tranche of an award will be earned 
we used what is termed a monte carlo simulation model which determines a value and earnings periods based on multiple outcomes and their probabilities 
beginning in  we recorded expense over the expected or derived vesting periods using the calculated value of the awards 
we recorded expense over these vesting periods even though the awards have not yet been earned and  in fact  may never be earned 
principles of consolidation property holding entities and other subsidiaries of which we own of the equity or have a controlling financial interest evidenced by ownership of a majority voting interest are consolidated 
all inter company balances and transactions are eliminated 
for entities in which we own less than of the equity interest  we consolidate the property if we have the direct or indirect ability to control the entities activities based upon the terms of the respective entities ownership agreements 
for these entities  we record a non controlling interest representing equity held by non controlling interests 
we continually evaluate all of our transactions and investments to determine if they represent variable interests in a variable interest entity 
if we determine that we have a variable interest in a variable interest entity  we then evaluate if we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
the evaluation is a qualitative assessment as to whether we have the ability to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
we consolidate each variable interest entity in which we  by virtue of or transactions with our investments in the entity  are considered to be the primary beneficiary 
at december  and  we determined that we were not the primary beneficiary of any of our variable interest entities because we do not control the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities 

table of contents disclosure of contractual obligations the following table summarizes known material contractual obligations as of december  amounts in thousands less than after contractual obligations year years years years total senior unsecured notes exchangeable senior notes revolving credit facilities term loans operating lease commitments purchase obligations totals reflects only unused credit facility fees as this assumes balance in effect at december  as of december  remains in effect through maturity 
assumes interest rates in effect at december  based on terms of the debt agreements 
most of our contractual obligations to make operating lease payments are related to ground leases for which we are reimbursed by our tenants along with corporate office and equipment leases 
includes million that we currently expect to provide to the lessee of one of our california facilities to renovate and upgrade the facility as necessary to comply with the applicable seismic laws see item of this form k for more information on current seismic laws 
this additional investment would increase our lease base  and accordingly  the lessee would subsequently pay higher rent for the facility 
in addition  this includes approximately million of future development expenditures related to florence and other capital project expenditures and our investment in northland ltach hospital that we acquired in february which included the assumption of a million existing mortgage loan that matures in january the interest rates on these notes are currently fixed  but in will be switched to variable rates 
however  we have entered into interest rate swaps to fix these interest rates until maturity 
for million of our million senior notes  the rate will be and for million of our million senior notes the rate will be 
see note of item to this form k for more information 
liquidity and capital resources we generated cash of million from operating activities during  which primarily consists of rent and interest from mortgage and working capital loans  which  along with cash on hand  proceeds from the sale of stock and our inglewood and montclair properties and early loan prepayments by prime and marina  were principally used to fund our dividends of million  real estate acquisitions of million and our debt refinancing activities 
at december   we had approximately million available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and cash of million 
in april  we completed a public offering the offering of million shares of common stock at per share 
including the underwriters purchase of million additional shares to cover over allotments  net proceeds from this offering  after underwriters discounts and commissions  were million 
we have used the net proceeds from the offering to pay off our million term loan that was due this year and to fund our purchase of of the outstanding exchangeable senior notes due at a price of of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest or million 
in may  we entered into a new million secured credit facility with a syndicate of banks and others  the proceeds of which  along with the offering proceeds  were used to repay in full all outstanding obligations under the old million credit facility 
the new facility includes a million three year term revolving facility which was increased to million in september and a million six year term loan 
we may further increase the revolving facility up to million through an accordion feature through november during the second quarter  we entered into an interest rate swap to fix million of our million senior notes  starting july  date on which the interest rate is scheduled to turn variable through maturity date or july 
table of contents  at a rate of 
we also entered into an interest rate swap to fix million of our senior notes starting october  date on which the related interest rate is scheduled to turn variable through the maturity date at a rate of 
we are currently paying a weighted average rate of on these notes  so we expect to save million annually on interest expense once the swaps become effective in july and october in  we sold the real estate of our inglewood hospital and montclair hospital to prime for million and million  respectively  and received prepayment of our marina mortgage loan of million 
separately  prime also repaid million in outstanding loans plus accrued interest in april in addition  prime paid us million in additional rent related to our shasta property 
we generated cash of million from operating activities during  which  along with borrowings from our revolving credit facility  were used to fund our dividends of million and investing activities of million 
in january  we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock at per share 
including the underwriters purchase of million additional shares to cover over allotments  net proceeds from this offering  after underwriting discount and commission and fees  were approximately million 
the net proceeds of this offering were generally used to repay borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities 
our debt facilities impose certain restrictions on us  including restrictions on our ability to incur debts  grant liens  provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other entity  make redemptions and repurchases of our capital stock  prepay  redeem or repurchase debt  engage in mergers or consolidations  enter into affiliated transactions  dispose of real estate  and change our business 
in addition  these agreements limit the amount of dividends we can pay to of normalized adjusted funds from operations  as defined in the agreements  on a rolling four quarter basis starting for the fiscal quarter ending march  and thereafter 
prior to march   a similar dividend restriction exists but at a higher percentage for transitional purposes 
these agreements also contain provisions for the mandatory prepayment of outstanding borrowings under these facilities from the proceeds received from the sale of properties that serve as collateral  except a portion may be reinvested subject to certain limitations  as defined in the credit facility agreement 
in addition to these restrictions  the new credit facility contains customary financial and operating covenants  including covenants relating to our total leverage ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio  mortgage secured leverage ratio  recourse mortgage secured leverage ratio  consolidated adjusted net worth  facility leverage ratio  and borrowing base interest coverage ratio 
this facility also contains customary events of default  including among others  nonpayment of principal or interest  material inaccuracy of representations and failure to comply with our covenants 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing under the facility  the entire outstanding balance may become immediately due and payable 
at december   we were in compliance with all such financial and operating covenants 
in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to distribute annual dividends equal to a minimum of of our reit taxable income  computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains 
see section titled distribution policy within this item of this annual report on form k for further information on our dividend policy along with the historical dividends paid on a per share basis 
short term liquidity requirements at february   our availability under our revolving credit facilities plus cash on hand approximated million 
we have million in principal payments due including the maturity of one term loan for approximately million and the remainder of our exchangeable notes of approximately million in the million term loan may be extended to if the related mortgaged property s lease is extended  however  no assurances can be made at this time as to whether this lease will be extended or not 
besides these maturities  we have only nominal principal payments due and million in approved capital projects 
we believe that the liquidity currently available to us  along with our current monthly cash receipts from rent and loan interest  is sufficient to provide the resources necessary for operations  debt and interest obligations  our firm commitments  distributions in compliance with reit requirements  and to fund our current investment strategies for the next months 
in addition  we have an at the market offering in place under which we may to sell up to million in shares  of which million has been sold to date which may be used for general corporate purposes as needed 
long term liquidity requirement with current availability  as discussed above  along with our current monthly cash receipts from rent and loan interest  we believe we have the liquidity available to us to fund our 
table of contents operations  debt and interest obligations  firm commitments  and distributions in compliance with reit requirements  and investment strategies in in addition  since we have only nominal principal payments coming due in  we believe our current liquidity and monthly cash receipts from rent and interest could fund our principal and interest payments and our operations in however  in  when our exchangeable notes come due or if we decide to make new investments in or substantially increase our investments in  we will require external capital 
we believe we have several alternatives to raise such capital including proceeds from property sales  issuance of new debt  including convertible notes  senior unsecured notes and replacement or extensions of our revolver  and sale of equity 
however  there is no assurance that conditions will remain favorable for such possible transactions or that our plans will be successful 
results of operations we began operations during the second quarter of since then  we have substantially increased our income earning investments each year see overview section in this item for more details  and we expect to continue to add to our investment portfolio  subject to the capital markets and other conditions described in this annual report on form k 
accordingly  we expect that future results of operations will vary from our historical results 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net income for the year ended december  was million compared to net income of million for the year ended december  a comparison of revenues for the years ended december  and is as follows change dollar amounts in thousands base rents straight line rents percentage rents interest from loans fee income total revenue revenue for the year ended december   was comprised of rents and interest and fee income from loans 
the increase in base rents and percentage rent is primarily due to incremental revenue from acquisitions made in and other new investments along with the re leasing of our bucks and covington properties 
straight line rents were significantly less compared to the prior year due to the million write off of straight line rent receivables in third quarter associated with our monroe facility  million related to the cleveland transaction in the third quarter  million of straight line rent was reclassified as base rent in the second quarter upon the payment of million by prime pursuant to the additional rent provisions of the lease related to our shasta property  partially offset by reserve write off of million for our covington and denham springs properties in the second quarter

table of contents real estate depreciation and amortization during the year ended december  was million  compared to million in  an increase 
depreciation increased due to the incremental depreciation from the acquisitions in property related expenses during the years ended december  and  totaled million and million  respectively  which represents an increase of 
this increase is primarily related to the write off of million in receivables related to a former tenant in the fourth quarter of the property related expenses in and  million and million  respectively  represented utility costs  repair and maintenance expense  legal  and property taxes associated with vacant or previously vacant properties 
in the first quarter  we recognized a million loan impairment charge related to our monroe facility 
no such charge was recorded in general and administrative expenses during the years ended december  and  totaled million and million  respectively  which represents an increase of 
the majority of this increase relates to executive severance of million recorded during the second quarter of as a result of the resignation of an executive officer and million in legal and other costs related to acquisition due diligence and closing costs in interest and other income is higher than prior year due to the million gain on the property exchange in interest expense for the years ended december  and totaled million and million  respectively 
this decrease is primarily due to lower debt balances in as a result of the debt refinancing during the second quarter 
in regards to the debt refinancing  we recorded a charge of million related to the write off of previously deferred financing costs and the premiums we paid associated with our repurchase of additional outstanding exchangeable notes 
in addition to the items noted above  net income for the year was impacted by discontinued operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item to this form k for further information

the increase in base rents  percentage rents  and interest is primarily due to incremental revenue from acquisitions made in and other new investments 
straight line rents more than doubled compared to the prior year due to the million write off of straight line rent receivables in associated with the lease termination of river oaks  bucks county and our hospital in redding  california  partially offset by a similar reserve write off for our covington and denham springs properties in the second quarter

distribution policy we have elected to be taxed as a reit commencing with our taxable year that began on april  and ended on december  to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we distribute at least of our reit taxable income  excluding net capital gain  to our stockholders 
it is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain such status going forward 
the table below is a summary of our distributions declared for the three year period ended december  declaration date record date date of distribution distribution per share november  december  january  august  september  october  may  june  july  february  march  april  november  december  january  august  september  october  may  june  july  february  march  april  december  december  january  august  september  october  may  june  july  february  march  april  we intend to pay to our stockholders  within the time periods prescribed by the code  all or substantially all of our annual taxable income  including taxable gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on the sale of securities 
it is our policy to make sufficient cash distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our status as a reit under the code and to avoid corporate income and excise taxes on undistributed income

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
in addition  the value of our facilities will be subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the ability of our tenants to generate profits  all of which may affect our ability to refinance our debt if necessary 
the changes in the value of our facilities would be impacted also by changes in cap rates  which is measured by the current base rent divided by the current market value of a facility 
our primary exposure to market risks relates to fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices 
the following analyses present the sensitivity of the market value  earnings and cash flows of our significant financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest rates and equity prices as if these changes had occurred 
the hypothetical changes chosen for these analyses reflect our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
these forward looking disclosures are selective in nature and only address the potential impact from financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact our business as a result of changes in market conditions 
interest rate sensitivity for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income to common stockholders or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income to common stockholders and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december   our outstanding debt totaled million  which consisted of fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million 
if market interest rates increase by one percentage point  the fair value of our fixed rate debt  after considering the effects of the interest rate swaps entered into in  would decrease by million 
changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt will not have any impact on us unless we decided to repurchase the debt in the open markets 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase by  the increase in annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by million per year 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt decrease by  the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by million per year 
this assumes that the average amount outstanding under our variable rate debt for a year approximates million  the balance at december  share price sensitivity during  we purchased of the outstanding exchangeable senior notes due at a price of of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest or million 
at december   only million of these notes remained outstanding 
our exchangeable notes were initially exchangeable into shares of our stock for each  note 
this equates to a conversion price of per share 
this conversion price adjusts based on a formula which considers increases to our dividend subsequent to the issuance of the notes in november our dividends declared since we sold the exchangeable notes have adjusted our conversion price to per share which equates to shares per  note 
future changes to the conversion price will depend on our level of dividends which cannot be predicted at this time 
any adjustments for dividend increases until the notes are settled in will affect the price of the notes and the number of shares for which they will eventually be settled 
at the time we issued the exchangeable notes  we also entered into a capped call  or call spread  transaction 
the effect of this transaction was to increase the conversion price from to 
as a result  our shareholders will not experience any dilution until our share price exceeds 
based on the remainder of the notes still outstanding at december  and if our share price exceeds that price  the result would be that we 
table of contents would issue additional shares of common stock 
assuming a price of per share  we would be required to issue an additional million shares 
at per share  we would be required to issue an additional million shares 
our exchangeable notes have a similar conversion adjustment feature which could affect its stated exchange ratio of common shares per  principal amount of notes  equating to an exchange price of per common share 
our dividends declared since we sold the exchangeable notes have not adjusted our conversion price as of december  future changes to the conversion price will depend on our level of dividends which cannot be predicted at this time 
any adjustments for dividend increases until the exchangeable notes are settled in will affect the price of the notes and the number of shares for which they may eventually be settled 
assuming a price of per share  we would be required to issue an additional million shares 
at per share  we would be required to issue an additional million shares
