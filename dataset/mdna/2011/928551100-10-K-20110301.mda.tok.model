on october   we received a complete response letter  or crl  regarding the new drug application  or nda  for qnexa as a treatment for obesity 
the crl stated that in its current form  the nda for qnexa was not approvable 
the crl included the following areas clinical  labeling  risk evaluation and mitigation strategy  or rems  safety update  and drug scheduling 
in the clinical section of the crl  the fda requested a comprehensive assessment of topiramate and qnexa teratogenic potential including a detailed plan and strategy to evaluate and mitigate the potential teratogenic risks in women of childbearing potential taking the drug for the treatment of obesity 
in addition  the fda asked us to provide evidence that the elevation in heart rate mean beats per minute on the top dose associated with qnexa does not increase the risk for major adverse cardiovascular events 
the fda requested that we formally submit the results from the completed sequel study ob  a week extension study for a subset of patients who completed the previously reported week conquer study 
the fda reserved the right to comment further on proposed labeling 
on rems  the fda requested that a discussion of an already submitted rems plan be continued after we have submitted the written response 
the agency also requested a safety update of any new adverse events be submitted to the nda 
finally  the fda stated that if approved  qnexa would be a schedule iv drug due to the phentermine component 
on january   we held an end of review meeting with the fda to discuss the items contained in the crl and the information we plan to include in the resubmission of the nda for qnexa 
in anticipation of the meeting  we had provided a briefing document that included analyses integrating existing non clinical and clinical data to provide a comprehensive assessment of the teratogenic potential of topiramate 
in addition  we provided several new analyses to demonstrate that qnexa does not increase the risk for major cardiovascular events  which analyses included cardiovascular data from our sequel ob and sleep apnea ob studies 
we also provided a synopsis of the final study report for the sequel study 
no new clinical studies were requested in the crl 
at the meeting  presentations were made on the comprehensive assessment of the teratogenic potential of topiramate and qnexa  and evidence was presented that the increase in heart rate of beats per minute does not increase the risk for major adverse cardiovascular events 
the discussion also included elements of our proposed rems program for qnexa 
the fda chose to focus the meeting on the discussion of teratogenic potential for topiramate  specifically the incidence of oral clefts observed in the north american aed pregnancy registry and in the uk epilepsy and pregnancy registry 
as part of this meeting  the fda requested that we assess the feasibility of performing a retrospective observational study utilizing existing electronic healthcare databases to determine fetal outcomes including congenital malformations with an interest in oral cleft and low birth weight less than  gm in the offspring of women who received prophylaxis treatment with mg of topiramate for migraine during pregnancy  or the feasibility assessment 
although no other requests for additional information or studies were made by the fda at the meeting or in the crl  there can be no assurance that the fda will not request or require us to provide additional information or undertake additional studies in connection with the qnexa nda 
in the qnexa studies  which included offspring from women exposed to qnexa or topiramate  there were no reports of any congenital malformations or low birth weight 
the timing of the planned resubmission of the qnexa nda will be determined after agreement 
table of contents with the fda is reached on the feasibility assessment and whether a retrospective observational study would be needed 
we expect to reach agreement with the fda  and if deemed feasible  initiate the retrospective observational study on fetal outcomes within the next two months 
it is our goal to resubmit the nda for qnexa to the fda by the end of the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  development  and results of our business include but are not limited to our ability to complete the feasibility assessment made by the fda during our end of review meeting held january  as no additional guidance was given by the fda as to the potential parameters of the study it may be difficult to interpret the definition of feasibility 
in addition we do not know if we will be able to determine if enough live births to mothers exposed to mg of topiramate exist  the condition of their records and the records of the infants  the ability to properly link records of the mother to those of the infant  the ability to determine other important infant health factors including but not limited to the health status of the mother and the diagnosis for which she was prescribed topiramate  concomitant use of medications  smoking status during pregnancy  use of alcohol or illegal substances during pregnancy  mothers weight  nutrition during pregnancy and folic acid supplementation  family history and any other information necessary to determine the nature of any malformations  in particular oral cleft 
if the fda does not agree with our assessment we may appeal the decision or amend the nda to exclude women of childbearing potential  the fda interpretation of the data we submit relating to cardiovascular safety  the fda interpretation of the data from our sequel study ob and sleep apnea study ob  that we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials  impact on future sales based on contraindications contained in the label and extent of the rems program  our history of losses and variable quarterly results  substantial competition  risks related to the failure to protect our intellectual property and litigation in which we may become involved  uncertainties of government or third party payer reimbursement  our reliance on sole source suppliers  our limited sales and marketing efforts and our reliance on third parties  failure to continue to develop innovative investigational drug candidates and drugs  risks related to the failure to obtain united states food and drug administration  or fda  or foreign authority clearances or approvals and noncompliance with fda regulations  our ability to demonstrate through clinical testing the safety and effectiveness of our investigational drug candidates  our dependence on the performance of our collaborative partners  the timing of initiation and completion of clinical trials and submissions to the fda  the volatility and liquidity of the financial markets  our liquidity and capital resources  our expected future revenues  operations and expenditures  and other factors that are described from time to time in our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission  or the sec  including those set forth in this filing as item a

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included in item of part ii of this form k 
overview vivus  inc is a biopharmaceutical company  incorporated in as a california corporation and reincorporated in as a delaware corporation  dedicated to the development and commercialization of therapeutic drugs for large underserved markets 
currently  we have one investigational drug candidate  qnexa  which has been submitted for approval as a treatment for weight loss in the us and european union 
in the us  we received a complete response letter  or crl  for qnexa in october  which contained requests for additional information 
on january   we held an end of review meeting with the fda to discuss its requests and our planned resubmission of the nda for qnexa 
the fda has requested that we perform the feasibility assessment  which is currently in process 
we also have investigational drug candidates in various stages of clinical development  and we are focused on market opportunities in obesity and related morbidities  such as sleep apnea and diabetes  and men sexual health 
with respect to obesity  it is estimated that the potential 
table of contents pharmaceutical market for obesity could approach billion annually 
annual sales of approved drugs for diabetes currently exceed billion 
there are currently no approved pharmaceutical therapies for sleep apnea  however  the sales of devices and related consumables used to treat sleep apnea exceed billion annually 
the indications targeted by our investigational drug candidate as a treatment for erectile dysfunction represent a projected market greater than billion annually 
recent developments as mentioned above  on january   we held an end of review meeting with the fda to discuss our planned response to the crl received on october   regarding the new drug application for qnexa as a treatment for obesity 
the crl stated that in its current form  the nda for qnexa was not approvable

the fda chose to focus the meeting on the discussion of teratogenic potential for topiramate  specifically the incidence of oral clefts observed in the north american aed pregnancy registry and in the uk epilepsy and pregnancy registry 
as part of this meeting  the fda requested that we complete the feasibility assessment 
although no other requests for additional information or studies were made by the fda at the meeting or in the crl  there can be no assurance that the fda will not request or require us to provide additional information or undertake additional studies in connection with the qnexa nda 
in the qnexa studies  which included births from women exposed to qnexa or topiramate  there were no reports of any congenital malformations or low birth weight 
the timing of the planned resubmission of the qnexa nda will be determined after agreement with the fda is reached on the feasibility assessment and whether a retrospective observational study would be needed 
we expect to reach agreement with the fda  and if deemed feasible  initiate the retrospective observational study on fetal outcomes within the next two months 
it is our goal to resubmit the nda for qnexa to the fda by the end of on october   we entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement with meda ab  or meda  to sell certain rights and assets related to muse  transurethral alprostadil  for the treatment of erectile dysfunction  or the muse transaction 
meda has been our european distributor of muse since the assets sold in the muse transaction include the us and foreign muse patents  
table of contents existing inventory and the manufacturing facility located in lakewood  new jersey 
we retained all of the liabilities associated with the pre closing operations and products of the muse business and the accounts receivables for pre closing muse sales 
the transaction closed on november  prior to the closing of the muse transaction  we regained all of the rights to muse and avanafil held by deerfield management company  lp  and affiliates  and crown bank  lp  or crown 
on october   in preparation for the closing of the muse transaction and in accordance with the terms of the agreements with crown  we paid million to crown in satisfaction of all obligations owed to them under these agreements 
as a result  the security interests and certificate of deposit held by crown were terminated in our favor 
on october   we exercised the option under the deerfield opa  and we paid an aggregate amount totaling million  which consisted of the base option price of million  less the option premium adjustment of million  plus the cash adjustment of million and the royalty adjustment of million 
these payments satisfied all of the financial obligations under the fara and opa 
as a result  all of the outstanding shares and the million of cash of the deerfield sub are owned by us  all of the outstanding loans owed by the deerfield sub have been repaid and the security interests in the collateral related to muse and avanafil held by the deerfield sub and the deerfield affiliates as part of the fara and opa were terminated 
in december  the deerfield sub was dissolved 
under the terms of the muse transaction  we received an upfront payment of million upon the closing  on november   and are eligible to receive an additional million based on future sales of muse  provided that certain sales milestones are reached 
meda is now responsible for the manufacturing  selling and marketing of muse 
meda also assumed all post closing expenses and liabilities associated with muse 
we have agreed not to develop  manufacture or sell any transurethral erectile dysfunction drugs for a period of three years following the closing of the muse transaction 
the assets and liabilities and results of operations associated with muse have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
on december   we filed a marketing authorization application  or maa  with the european medicines agency  or ema  for qnexa controlled release capsules in the european union  or eu 
the proposed indication in the eu is for the treatment of obesity  including weight loss and maintenance of weight loss  and should be used in conjunction with a mildly hypocaloric diet 
if approved in the eu  qnexa could be recommended for obese adult patients bmi kg m  or overweight patients bmi kg m with weight related co morbidities such as hypertension  type diabetes  dyslipidemia  or central adiposity abdominal obesity 
in europe  approximately million adults are considered overweight or obese  and the prevalence is rising rapidly 
according to ema guidelines for medicinal products used in weight control  a demonstration of weight loss of at least of baseline weight  which is at least greater than that associated with placebo  is considered to be a valid primary efficacy criterion 
we believe qnexa has met this efficacy criterion set by the ema for obesity therapies 
in addition  the mean weight loss for the mid and top dose of qnexa at the end of two years was and  respectively  which met the efficacy benchmark set by the ema for obesity therapies 
these results were shown to be sustained over a two year period and were associated with significant improvements in weight related co morbidities such as hypertension  dyslipidemia and diabetes 
the ema filing is comprised of data from over  overweight or obese patients with a broad range of weight related co morbidities 
two year  double blind data from sequel ob were also included in the filing to demonstrate durability of treatment response and long term safety 
the ema review of qnexa will follow their centralized marketing authorization procedure 
if approved  qnexa could receive marketing authorization in all eu member countries 
the maa was officially validated for central procedure on january  
table of contents our future our goal is to build a successful biopharmaceutical company through the development and commercialization of innovative proprietary drugs 
we intend to achieve this by seeking approval for qnexa for the treatment of obesity in the us and the us  establishing internal capabilities or strategic relationships with marketing partners to maximize sales potential for our drugs that require significant commercial support  and capitalizing on our clinical and regulatory expertise and experience to advance the development of investigational drug candidates in our pipeline 
it is our objective to become a leader in the development and commercialization of drugs for large underserved markets 
we believe we have strong intellectual property supporting several opportunities in obesity and related disorders  such as sleep apnea and diabetes  and men sexual health 
our future growth depends on our ability to further develop and obtain regulatory approval of our investigational drug candidates for indications that we have studied  or plan to study  as well as in licensing and product line extensions 
we have funded operations primarily through private and public offerings of our common stock  through the sale of the rights to evamist and through product sales of muse alprostadil 
we expect to generate future net losses due to increases in operating expenses as our various investigational drug candidates are advanced through the various stages of clinical development and for pre commercialization activities 
in connection with the sale of evamist  to date we have received an aggregate of million 
the sale of evamist was a unique transaction 
an initial million was paid at closing and million was paid upon the fda approval of the evamist nda 
these payments were non refundable and were originally recorded as deferred revenue and were recognized as license and other revenue ratably over a month period  from august  to may  all of the revenue deferred from the evamist sale has been recognized 
as of december   we have incurred a cumulative deficit of million and expect to incur operating losses in future years 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to available for sale securities  research and development expenses  income taxes  inventories  contingencies and litigation and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition license and other revenue we recognize license revenue in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  as codified in the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  revenue recognition  or asc when evaluating multiple element arrangements  we consider whether the components of the 
table of contents arrangement represent separate units of accounting as defined in emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  as codified in fasb asc topic  subtopic multiple element arrangements  or asc in accordance with eitf  we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the delivered element has stand alone value and we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for each undelivered element 
if the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement cannot be objectively determined  revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements  or such elements are insignificant 
application of this standard requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the fair value of the individual elements and whether such elements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship 
revenue from non refundable  upfront license fees where we have continuing involvement is recognized ratably over the development or agreement period 
revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements 
on may   we closed our transaction with k v pharmaceutical company  or k v  for the sale of our investigational drug candidate  evamist  a metered dose transdermal spray for the treatment of menopause symptoms 
at the time of the sale  evamist was an investigational product and was not yet approved by the fda for marketing 
the sale transaction contained multiple deliverables  including the delivery at closing of the evamist assets mainly raw material inventory and certain fixed assets  a grant of a sublicense of our rights under a license related to evamist  and a license to the mdts applicator  the delivery upon receipt of regulatory approval of evamist  along with all regulatory submissions  and  lastly  the delivery after fda approval of certain transition services and a license to improvements to the mdts applicator 
we received approval from the fda to market evamist on july   or fda approval  and on august   we transferred and assigned the evamist fda submissions and all files related thereto to k v 
in august  we assigned all of our rights and obligations under the evamist license agreement to k v 
we received an upfront payment of million in may upon the closing and received an additional million milestone payment in august upon fda approval 
these payments are non refundable 
we evaluated this multiple deliverable arrangement to determine whether the deliverables were divided into separate units of accounting 
upon fda approval  the two remaining deliverables were the transition services to be performed under the transition services agreement  or tsa  and a license to improvements to the mdts applicator  or improvement license  during the two year period commencing with the closing  or may   and ending on may  we were able to establish fair value for the tsa 
as it relates to the improvement license  no specific value was assigned in the agreement 
we had no obligation to develop improvements to the mdts applicator and had no plans to expend significant resources in this endeavor 
however  we did not have objective  reliable evidence of fair value or evidence of inconsequential value to the customer of the improvement license 
accordingly  the delivered items  together with the undelivered items  were bundled together and were treated as one unit of accounting 
as a result  the initial million paid at closing and the million paid upon fda approval were recorded as deferred revenue and have been recognized as license revenue ratably over the month term of the improvement license  from august  to may  the revenue related to the transaction recognized for years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu no 
amends the guidance for measurement and separation of deliverables in multiple element arrangements under eitf issue  as codified in fasb asc  and significantly increases the related disclosure requirements 
under this new guidance  which will be effective for us beginning january   our accounting for the revenue from the sale of the evamist transaction may have been different 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development  or r d  expenses include license fees  related compensation  consultants fees  facilities costs  administrative expenses related to r d activities and clinical trial costs at other companies and research institutions under agreements that are generally cancelable  among other related r d costs 
we also record accruals for estimated ongoing clinical trial costs 
clinical trial costs represent costs incurred by clinical research organizations  or cros  and clinical sites and include advertising for clinical trials and patient recruitment costs 
these costs are recorded as a component of r d expenses and are expensed as incurred 
under our agreements  progress payments are typically made to investigators  clinical sites and cros 
we analyze the progress of the clinical trials  including levels of patient enrollment  invoices received and contracted costs when evaluating the adequacy of accrued liabilities 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions 
revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the most recent tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if it is not more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets  we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
as a result of our analysis of all available evidence  both positive and negative  as of december   it was considered more likely than not that the company deferred tax assets would not be realized 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we would recognize a benefit to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we record inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence  unmarketable or excess inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory write downs may be required 
cash and cash equivalents the company considers highly liquid investments with maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
at december   all cash equivalents are invested in money market funds and us treasury securities 
these accounts are recorded at fair value 

table of contents cash with restrictions for a period of greater than months is classified as restricted cash  a non current asset 
available for sale securities we focus on liquidity and capital preservation in our investments in available for sale securities 
our investment policy  as approved by the audit committee of the board of directors  allows us to invest our excess cash balances in money market and marketable securities  primarily us treasury securities and debt securities of us government agencies  corporate debt securities and asset backed securities 
we periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required 
we determine the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date 
our marketable securities have been classified and accounted for as available for sale 
we may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than months until maturity 
in response to changes in the availability of and the yield on alternative investments as well as liquidity requirements  we may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities 
as these securities are viewed by us as available to support current operations securities with maturities beyond months are classified as current assets 
securities are carried at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as a component of stockholders equity  unless the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary and we intend to sell such securities before recovering their costs  in which case such securities are written down to fair value and the loss is charged to other than temporary loss on impaired securities 
we evaluate our investment securities for other than temporary declines based on quantitative and qualitative factors 
any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined on a specific identification method  and such gains and losses are reflected as a component of interest income 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  fsp sfas and sfas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments fsp sfas and sab topic m  accounting for non current marketable equity securities  as codified in fasb asc topic  investments debt and equity securities  or asc  provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
fsp is effective for all periods ending after june  and provides additional guidance designed to create a greater clarity and consistency in accounting for and presenting impairment losses on securities 
for securities that are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  the security is adjusted to fair value and the resulting losses are recognized in other than temporary loss on impaired securities in the consolidated statements of operations 
during our quarterly impairment assessments  we determined that a decline in value of certain securities was other than temporary 
accordingly  we recorded other than temporary impairment adjustments of  in the year ended december  we included this non cash impairment charge in other than temporary loss on impaired securities in the consolidated statements of operations 
these securities covered a number of industries 
contingencies and litigation we are periodically involved in disputes and litigation related to a variety of matters 
when it is probable that we will experience a loss  and that loss is quantifiable  we record appropriate reserves 
we record legal fees and costs as an expense when incurred 
share based payments we follow the fair value method of accounting for share based compensation arrangements in accordance with sfas r  share based payment  as codified in fasb asc topic  compensation 
table of contents stock compensation  or asc we adopted sfas r effective january  using the modified prospective method of transition 
under sfas r  the estimated fair value of share based compensation  including stock options and restricted stock units granted under our stock option plan and purchases of common stock by employees at a discount to market price under the employee stock purchase plan  or the espp  is recognized as compensation expense 
compensation expense for purchases under the espp is recognized based on the estimated fair value of the common stock purchase rights during each offering period and the percentage of the purchase discount 
we recorded million  million and million of share based compensation expense from continuing and discontinued operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
share based compensation expense is allocated among research and development  general and administrative expenses and discontinued operations based on the function of the related employee 
this charge had no impact on our cash flows for the periods presented 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the share based awards as of the grant date 
the black scholes model  by its design  is highly complex  and dependent upon key data inputs estimated by management 
the primary data inputs with the greatest degree of judgment are the estimated lives of the share based awards and the estimated volatility of our stock price 
the black scholes model is highly sensitive to changes in these two data inputs 
the expected term of the options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and is derived by analyzing the historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
we determine expected volatility using the historical method  which is based on the daily historical trading data of our common stock over the expected term of the option 
management selected the historical method primarily because we have not identified a more reliable or appropriate method to predict future volatility 
for more information about asc  see note stock option and purchase plans to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
fair value on january   we adopted sfas no 
fair value measurements  as codified in fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  or asc  and effective october   we adopted fsp no 
sfas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  except as it applies to the nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities subject to fsp on january   we adopted sfas no with respect to non financial assets and non financial liabilities 
on june  we adopted fsp  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the assets or liabilities have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
adoption of the provisions of these standards did not have a material effect on our financial position 
financial instruments measured at fair value 
our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale financial instruments are carried at fair value and we make estimates regarding valuation of these assets measured at fair value in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurement definition and hierarchy 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie  the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
valuation technique 
sfas no 
establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of vivus 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best 
table of contents information available in the circumstances 
sfas no 
prescribes three valuation techniques that shall be used to measure fair value as follows market approach uses prices or other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities 
income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future cash flow amounts to a single present value amount discounted 
cost approach the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset ie  current replacement cost 
one or a combination of the approaches above can be used to calculate fair value  whichever results in the most representative fair value 
in addition to the three valuation techniques  sfas no 
prescribes a fair value hierarchy in order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures 
the hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 
since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market  valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment 
these types of instruments primarily consist of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as cash  money market funds and us treasury securities that are actively traded 
management judgment was required to determine our policy that defines the levels at which sufficient volume and frequency of transactions is met for a market to be considered active 
level valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable  directly or indirectly 
quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
the types of instruments valued based on other observable inputs include debt securities of us government agencies  corporate bonds  mortgage backed and asset backed products 
substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace  can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 
level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
these types of instruments have included certain corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities 
we have no level securities as of december  or level is comprised of unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity 
these instruments are considered level when their fair values are determined using pricing models  discounted cash flows or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable 
level may still include some observable inputs such as yield spreads derived from markets with limited activity

the fda chose to focus the meeting on the discussion of teratogenic potential for topiramate  specifically the incidence of oral clefts observed in the north american aed pregnancy registry and in the uk epilepsy and pregnancy registry 
as part of this meeting the fda requested that we complete the feasibility assessment 
although no other requests for additional information or studies were made by the fda at the meeting or in the crl  there can be no assurance that the fda will not request or require us to provide additional information or undertake additional studies in connection with the qnexa nda 
in the qnexa studies  which included births from women exposed to qnexa or topiramate  there were no reports of any congenital malformations or low birth weight 
the timing of the planned resubmission of the qnexa nda will be determined after agreement with the fda is reached on the feasibility assessment and whether a retrospective observational study would be needed

the funding necessary to execute our business strategies is subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
completion of clinical trials and approval by the fda may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of an investigational drug candidate 
it is also important to note that if an investigational drug candidate is identified  the further development of that candidate can be halted or abandoned at any time due to a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  funding constraints  lack of efficacy or safety or change in market demand 
the nature and efforts required to develop our investigational drug candidates into commercially viable drugs include research to identify a clinical candidate  pre clinical development  clinical testing  fda approval and commercialization 
this process is very costly and can take in excess of years to complete for each investigational drug candidate 
the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary 
table of contents significantly over the life of a project as a result of matters arising during the clinical studies  including  among others  the following we or the fda may suspend trials  we may discover that an investigational drug candidate may cause harmful side effects or is not effective  patient recruitment may be slower than expected  and patients may drop out of the trials 
for each of our investigational drug candidate development programs  we periodically assess the scientific progress and the merits of the programs to determine if continued research and development is economically viable 
certain of our programs were terminated due to the lack of scientific progress and lack of prospects for ultimate commercialization 
as such  the ultimate timeline and costs to commercialize a drug cannot be accurately estimated 
our investigational drug candidates have not yet achieved fda regulatory approval  which is required before we can market them as therapeutic products 
in order to achieve regulatory approval  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish substantial evidence of safety and efficacy 
the results from pre clinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results in later clinical trials 
it is possible for a candidate to show promising results in early clinical trials  but subsequently fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy data necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  the duration and completion of our investigational drug candidate development programs are difficult to estimate and are subject to considerable variation 
our inability to complete our research and investigational drug candidate development programs in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
our inability to raise capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
we may also be required to make further substantial expenditures if unforeseen difficulties arise in other areas of our business 
in particular  our future capital and additional funding requirements will depend upon or be impacted by numerous factors  including the timing and substance of our response to the fda request to perform a feasibility study on a retrospective observational study of congenital malformations with an interest in oral cleft and low birth weight in infants born to women who received prophylaxis treatment with mg of topiramate for migraine during pregnancy  and if deemed feasible the cost  timing and outcome of such study and the other items included in the complete response letter  the fda interpretation of the data we submit relating to cardiovascular safety  the fda interpretation of the data from our sequel study ob and sleep apnea ob  whether or not the fda requires us to perform additional clinical studies for qnexa  the cost and time required to set up a distribution system and rems program for qnexa that is suitable to address any fda concerns  the progress and costs of our research and development programs  the scope  timing and results of pre clinical  clinical and retrospective observational studies and trials  
table of contents the cost of access to electronic records and databases that allow for retrospective observational studies  patient recruitment and enrollment in planned and future clinical trials  the costs involved in seeking regulatory approvals for our investigational drug candidates  the costs involved in filing and pursuing patent applications and enforcing patent claims  the establishment of collaborations  sublicenses and strategic alliances and the related costs  including milestone payments  the costs involved in establishing a commercial operation and in launching a product without a partner  the cost of manufacturing and commercialization activities and arrangements  the results of operations  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the rate of technological advances  ongoing determinations of the potential commercial success of our investigational drug candidates under development  the state of the economy and financing environment  the regulatory approval environment and regulatory hurdles for safety assessment for new products  the cost  timing and outcome of litigations  the healthcare reimbursement system or the impact of healthcare reform  if any  imposed by the us federal government  the level of resources devoted to sales and marketing capabilities  perceptions and interpretations of qnexa or the data by outside analysts or others  and the activities of competitors 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources combined with anticipated future cash flows will be sufficient to support our operating needs at least into however  we anticipate that we may require additional funding to continue our research and investigational drug candidate development programs  to conduct pre clinical studies and trials  to fund operating expenses  to pursue regulatory approvals for our investigational drug candidates  to finance the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending our patent claims  if any  and we may require additional funding to establish additional or new manufacturing and marketing capabilities in the future  to manufacture quantities of our investigational drug candidates for approval and commercialization  or to launch a product 
in particular  we expect to make other substantial payments to the inventor of qnexa pending approval by the fda and to mtpc  in accordance with our agreements with mtpc in connection with the licensing of avanafil 
these payments are based on certain development  regulatory and sales milestones 
in addition  we are required to make royalty payments on any future product sales 
similar to the transaction with evamist  we may consider selling or licensing any of our investigational drug candidates in development in order to raise additional funding 
we may seek to access the public or private equity markets at any time 
the sale of additional equity securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we may also seek additional funding through strategic alliances  acquisitions of companies with cash balances and other financing mechanisms 
we cannot assure you that adequate funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail significantly one or more of our investigational drug 
table of contents candidate development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others 
this may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or investigational drug candidates and to pay royalties on future product sales 
to the extent that we are unable to obtain third party funding for such expenses  we expect that increased expenses may result in future losses from operations 
we are continually evaluating our existing portfolio and we may choose to divest or sell one or more of our investigational drug candidates at any time 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop our products under development or that our products  if approved for sale  will generate revenues sufficient to enable us to earn a profit

this amount represents the remaining contractual amounts due under various contracts  although all of these contracts could be cancelled by us  in which case we would only be liable to the vendors for work performed to the date of cancellation 
additional payments we have entered into development  license and supply agreements that contain provisions for payments upon completion of certain development  regulatory and sales milestones

indemnifications in the normal course of business  the company provides indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of its products and to its clinical research organizations and investigators sites against liabilities incurred in connection with any third party claim arising from the work performed on behalf of the company  among others 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations

declaration or payment of future dividends  if any  will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors  including our financial condition  operating results and current and anticipated cash needs 
cautionary note on forward looking statements our business is subject to significant risks  including but not limited to  the risks inherent in our research and development activities  including the successful completion of clinical trials  the lengthy  expensive and uncertain process of seeking regulatory approvals  uncertainties associated both with the potential infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties  and with obtaining and enforcing our own patents and patent rights  uncertainties regarding government reforms and of product pricing and reimbursement levels  technological change  competition  manufacturing uncertainties and dependence on third parties 
even if our investigational drug candidates appear promising at an early stage of development  they may not reach the market for numerous reasons 
such reasons include the possibilities that the drug will be ineffective or unsafe during clinical trials  will fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  will be difficult to manufacture on a large scale  will be

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the securities and exchange commission rule related to market risk disclosure requires that we describe and quantify our potential losses from market risk sensitive instruments attributable to reasonably possible market changes 
market risk sensitive instruments include all financial or commodity instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to future changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other market factors 
market and interest rate risk our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities as of december  consisted primarily of money market funds and us treasury securities 
our cash is invested in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors that specifies the categories money market funds  us treasury securities and debt securities of us government agencies  corporate bonds  asset backed securities  and other securities  allocations  and ratings of securities we may consider for investment 
currently  we have focused on investing in us treasuries until market conditions improve 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the value of our investment may decline 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  by approximately  in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
there is ongoing concern in the credit markets regarding the value of a variety of mortgage backed and auction rate securities and the resultant effect on various securities markets 
in addition  continuing concerns over inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining residential real estate market in the us have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward 
these factors combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have precipitated an economic recession and fears of a possible depression 
domestic and international equity markets continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil 
these events and the continuing market upheavals may have an adverse effect on us 
in the event of a continuing market downturn  our results of operations could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary and may cause stock price volatility 
our investment policy  as approved by our board of directors  allows us to invest in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities that are not federally insured 
given the current economic instability  we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses on these investments
