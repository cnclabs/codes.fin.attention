table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net revenues represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations 
years ended december  net revenue cost of revenues gross profit selling and administrative expenses income loss from operations net earnings loss amounts exclude goodwill impairment charges of  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  and december  revenues net revenues during the twelve months ended december  rose to million from million in twelve months ended december  theatre products services total theatre revenues lighting other total net revenues theatre segment sales of theatre products and services increased to million in from million in and million in digital product sales sales of digital products rose to million in from million in as the industry change from analog to digital projection increased during  primarily in the us and china 
the growth in business in the us is primarily being driven by customers taking advantage of the opportunities that digital technology offers such as the ability to show d movies among other items 
the growth in china is resulting not only from converting analog equipment to digital but also due to the construction of new theatre complexes in china 
the majority of the increase in digital sales resulted from sales of digital projectors and certain accessories  however  sales of digital lamps also rose from million in to million in while sales of digital servers rose to million from million a year ago 
we also began to integrate projection equipment in our omaha plant 
table of contents where we consolidate and test digital equipment 
revenues generated from the product sold as part of this business was million during sales of digital products rose to million in from million in as the industry change to digital projection equipment began to accelerate during the increased demand resulted from movie exhibitors wanting to show movies in d digital format as they believed that d movies result in higher box office receipts 
the demand for digital equipment increased not only for the d benefits but also for such potential benefits as additional advertising and being able to project more alternative entertainment at the movie theatres 
the majority of the increase in digital sales resulted from sales of digital projectors  however  sales of digital lamps also rose from million in to million in film product sales sales of film projection equipment declined to million in from million a year ago due to the theatre exhibition industry transition to digital based systems 
sales of film projection equipment declined to million in from million in due to the theatre exhibition industry transition to digital based systems discussed above  coupled with a slowdown in new theatre construction in the united states and worldwide largely due to the economic and credit market conditions 
included in film equipment revenues were sales of used film equipment which amounted to million in compared to million in these used units were obtained from theatre chains which had converted their film auditoriums to digital and had no further use for the film projectors 
the decrease in used equipment sales during resulted from the lack of quality used equipment in the market 
while we anticipated a short term opportunity to buy  refurbish and resell the suitably conditioned units as they became available  we have not seen a significant change in used equipment sales as a result of movie theatre complexes converting from film to digital equipment and only recorded immaterial sales related to these activities in sales of replacement parts declined to million during from million during and million in we expect sales of film replacement parts to decrease over time as film equipment is replaced by digital units 
sales will depend on the pace of our film customers retrofitting their film projection theatres to digital cinema projection theatres and we continue to be unsure as to what extent our replacement part sales will be impacted by this activity and also by the increased availability of used parts 
sales of film lenses were insignificant in compared to million in each of and sales of xenon lamps were million in compared to million in each of and the decrease is mainly attributable to the loss of sales to a significant lamp customer coupled with the digital conversion taking place creating less demand for film products 
screen product sales revenues from the sale of screens rose to million in compared to million a year ago due to the substantial demand for digital d screens as theatres expanded the number of screens that can project d images 
sales were at record levels for this product line due to the higher demand for special silver screens needed for certain digital d applications 
this demand is the result of both our customers wanting to show more movies in digital d coupled with more d movies being available from the hollywood studios 
in addition  sales of large format screens to imax were also higher than a year ago 
we generated screen sales of million in compared to million in the increase year over year was primarily driven by higher demand for special silver screens coupled with more d movies being produced 
sales of large format screens to imax were also higher in than 
table of contents we sell screens for both digital cinema and film applications 
in some instances  a screen can be used interchangeably with either a digital projector or a film projector 
however  there are certain digital d applications such as the technology by reald that require special silver screens that we manufacture and which are driving the growth of the product line 
service revenues service revenues increased to million during from million a year ago 
revenues generated from servicing film equipment were million during compared to million during while revenues generated from servicing digital equipment increased to million in compared to million in the results reflect increased demand for installation and maintenance services pertaining to the conversion from analog to digital projectors by our customers primarily in the us as discussed in relation to digital product sales  we recognized service revenues of million associated with the integration of digital projection equipment in the omaha plant during service revenues increased in to million from million in due to the increase in digital projectors being sold in the industry and which require installation and maintenance services 
lighting segment sales of lighting products rose to million during from million in sales of follow spotlights rose to million from million a year ago 
sale of skytrackers rose to million from million in  while replacement part sales rose from million in to million in sales of all other lighting products  including but not limited to xenon lamps  britelights and led products amounted to million in compared to million in sales of lighting products fell to million during from million in sales of follow spotlights fell to million from million in sale of skytrackers fell to million in from million in  while replacement part sales fell from million in to million in sales of all other lighting products  including but not limited to xenon lamps  britelights and nocturns amounted to million in compared to million in lighting products were impacted by the effects of the troubled credit markets as a significant portion of the business is dependent on the construction or improvements of stadiums and auditoriums around the world 
export revenues sales outside the united states increased to million in from million in resulting primarily from increased demand in china and south america where sales increased by million and million  respectively 
the increased demand in china results from theatres chains retrofitting their current operations with digital equipment as well as the growth of new theatre complexes 
sales in south america were driven primarily by existing theatre complexes retrofitting their equipment to digital in order to take advantage of the d technology 
these sales were partially offset by a decrease in sales in mexico of million year over year 
sales in all other regions including canada  europe  asia excluding china and all other regions were relatively flat year over year all together driving a net increase of million in sales 
export sales are sensitive to worldwide economic and political conditions that can lead to volatility 
certain areas of the world are more cost conscious than the us market and there are instances where our products are priced higher than local manufacturers making it more difficult to generate sufficient profit to justify selling into these regions 
additionally  foreign exchange rates and excise taxes sometimes make it difficult to market our products overseas at reasonable selling prices 
sales outside the united states mainly theatre sales increased to million in from million in resulting primarily from increased sales in china where sales increased from 
table of contents million in to million in sales into mexico and south america were also higher than in increasing by million and million  respectively 
sales in canada increased to million in compared to million in due to an increase in d silver screens 
sales into europe reflected increased business for film products increasing to million from million in sales into asia declined to million from million in gross profit consolidated gross profit increased to million in from million a year ago but as a percent of total revenue decreased to from in gross profit in the theatre segment increased to million in from million in but as a percentage of theatre sales decreased to from a year ago 
the decrease in gross margin resulted from increased sales of digital projection equipment which carry lower margins but substantially higher revenue price points than our other products 
the lower digital projection margins were offset to a degree by improved margins from our screen and service business due primarily to the increased volume of sales from these businesses due the conversion to digital cinema 
we expect our gross margin as a percentage of revenues to decrease in the future primarily due to increased sales of digital projection equipment which carry lower margins compared to film equipment we manufacture 
however  the sales price on the digital projectors is higher than what we receive on film projectors which offsets gross margin dollars to a degree 
gross margins will also be impacted in the future by higher film manufacturing costs pertaining to lower demand for manufactured film products 
we expect to purchase film inventory components in lower quantities resulting in some raw material price increases and to experience less manufacturing throughput in the omaha plant to cover fixed overhead costs 
the gross profit in the lighting segment amounted to million or of lighting revenues in compared to million or of lighting revenues in the results reflect relatively flat sales year over year 
consolidated gross profit increased to million in from million in and as a percent of total revenue increased to from in gross profit in the theatre segment increased to million in from million in and as a percentage of theatre sales increased to from in the increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues resulted from improved margins from our screen business 
we also cut costs from our primary manufacturing operations in omaha during margins were higher from our service business due to revenues increasing from resulting in margins increasing million 
the service business relating to servicing film projection equipment is in a mature industry but we grew the infrastructure in anticipation of the digital cinema rollout which took on momentum in these factors resulted in the service division experiencing negative margins putting pressure on our overall margin 
the gross profit in the lighting segment amounted to million or as a percentage of revenues in compared to million or as a percentage of revenues in the results reflect lower sales levels in the segment 
selling expenses selling expenses increased to million from million in but as a percent of total revenue declined to from a year ago 
the results reflect an increase in personnel and associated costs coupled with increases in commission expenses due to the increase in product and services demand 
selling expenses decreased to million in compared to million in and as a percent of total revenue declined to from in the results reflect cutbacks in payroll 
table of contents which also resulted in lower travel and tradeshow expenditures 
in addition  the results reflected higher health insurance costs 
administrative expenses administrative costs rose to million in from million in but as a percent of total revenue decreased to in from in the increase in expenses is primarily due to the growth in personnel and related costs necessary to manage the significant growth in revenue experienced during the year 
administrative costs rose to million in from million in but as a percent of total revenue decreased to in from in the increase in expenses was related to severance charges  settlement of an asbestos lawsuit  outside consulting expenses  bonuses and stock compensation expenses  coupled with additional costs pertaining to the growth of our office in beijing  china 
during the first quarter of we incurred million of severance charges due to the layoff of personnel as we began the transition to more of a distribution model due to lower production needed for digital projects 
we also settled an asbestos lawsuit resulting in additional legal costs of million 
we experienced higher consulting fees during the year pertaining to the board of directors performing a search for the successor to the then chief executive officer before his retirement 
management achieved more targets under the company bonus plan resulting in higher bonus expenses compared to stock compensation expenses rose due to the company having more unvested restricted stock in compared to we first began granting restricted stock in and thus was the first full year of stock expense 
we cut back in certain other administrative areas such as bank fees  audit and compliance costs  and payroll costs which were also lower due to the layoffs in the first quarter of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million within our theatre and lighting segments based on an impairment analyses which took into consideration the ongoing transition taking place in our strategy and operations  moving from the manufacture of traditional film equipment to a business model focused on the distribution and service of digital projectors 
as a result of the impairment analysis performed  we determined the book value of goodwill was impaired 
no such charges took place in or as we no longer have any goodwill 
other financial items our results for reflect a gain of million pertaining to our share of equity in the income from digital link ii  llc 
this gain compares to the loss of million a year ago and was due to the sale of equipment by the llc to customers for projectors previously held in the llc 
our results for reflect the loss of million pertaining to our share of equity in the loss from digital link ii  llc compared to the loss of million 
the increase was due to more depreciation and interest costs resulting from additional deployments 
other expense amounted to million in compared to million in and other income of million in the results primarily reflect the impact of transaction losses arising from foreign exchange fluctuations during the year due to the us dollar weakening against the canadian dollar 
we recorded income tax expense of approximately million in compared to million in and an income tax benefit of million in the effective tax rate calculated as a ratio of income tax benefit expense to pretax earnings loss  inclusive of equity method investment earnings

liquidity and capital resources during the past several years  we have met our working capital and capital resource needs from either our operating or investing cash flows or a combination of both 
we ended fiscal year with total cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  effective june   we entered into a million revolving credit agreement and note collectively  the revolving credit agreement  each effective as of june   with wells fargo bank  na wells fargo 
we may request an increase in the revolving credit agreement of up to an additional million  however  any advances on the additional million are subject to approval of wells fargo 
the borrowings from the revolving credit agreement will primarily be used for working capital purposes and for other general corporate purposes 
our accounts receivable  general intangibles and inventory secure the revolving credit agreement

these working capital needs are resulting from the significant increase in business we are experiencing coupled with the significantly higher price point of the digital equipment we are currently purchasing and distributing 
we expect our working capital needs to continue to fluctuate from period to period during the industry transition to digital cinema 
net cash provided by operating activities amounted to million in compared to million in despite generating earnings of approximately million during  the decrease in operating cash flow from fiscal resulted primarily from receivables  inventory and other current assets increasing  and million respectively 
these working capital needs were offset to a degree by increases in accounts payable and customer balances of and million  respectively resulting in a net working capital increase of million for these five working capital items 
the increase in accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable pertained to increased purchases and sales of digital products which carry a higher price point reflecting the transition that was beginning in the industry 
the increase in other current assets and customer deposits primarily pertained to prepayments of digital product from vendors and where we required prepayments from customers in certain instances primarily in certain parts of china and asia 
net cash used in investing amounted to million in compared to cash provided by investing of million in the decrease of million is attributable to the liquidation of million in investments in that did not recur in as well as the increase in capital expenditures of million in compared to million in capital expenditures in primarily included the purchase of the land and building at our screen business in canada  the expansion of that facility and the construction of the network operating center at our headquarters

and kasima  llc represented approximately and of net consolidated receivables at december   respectively 
while the company believes its relationships with such customers are stable  most arrangements are made by purchase order and are terminable at will by either party 
a significant decrease or interruption in business from the company significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the company business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company could also be adversely affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency rates and weak economic and political conditions in each of the countries in which the company sells its products 
financial instruments that potentially expose us to a concentration of credit risk principally consist of accounts receivable 
we sell product to a large number of customers in many different geographic regions 
to minimize credit concentration risk  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition or use letters of credit 
hedging and trading activities the company primary exposure to foreign currency fluctuations pertains to its subsidiary in canada 
in certain instances  the company may enter into foreign exchange contracts to manage a portion of this risk 
for the period ended december   the company had recorded approximately million of unrealized gain associated with these open contracts in its consolidated statement of operations 
we do not have any trading activities that include non exchange traded contracts at fair value 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations our off balance sheet arrangements consist principally of leasing various assets under operating leases 
the future estimated payments under these arrangements are summarized below along with our other contractual obligations payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter non competition agreement postretirement benefits operating leases contractual cash obligations 
table of contents we have a contractual obligation to pay up to  to high end systems  inc payment is contingent on satisfaction of certain future sales of the product line purchased as part of the business 
in addition  we have accrued approximately million for the estimated underpayment of income taxes we are obligated to pay 
the accrual is primarily related to state tax matters 
there were no other contractual obligations other than inventory and property  plant and equipment purchases in the ordinary course of business 
the company has entered into agreements with third party film exhibitors which provide for the use of digital theatre projection equipment with a purchase option in the future

the company has recorded an insignificant liability at december  for the fair value of the obligations undertaken by issuing the guarantees 
the guarantees will expire by the end of june there were no other contractual obligations other than inventory and property  plant and equipment purchases in the ordinary course of business 
seasonality generally  our business exhibits a moderate level of seasonality as sales of theatre products typically increase during the third and fourth quarters 
we believe that such increased sales reflect seasonal increases in the construction of new motion picture screens in anticipation of the holiday movie season 
legal see note to the consolidated financial statements  and item of this report  for a description of legal matters 

table of contents inflation we believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on our net revenues or profitability 
we did experience higher than normal prices on certain raw materials during the year coupled with higher freight costs as freight companies passed on a portion of higher gas and oil costs 
historically  we have been able to offset any inflationary effects by either increasing prices or improving cost efficiencies 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the following accounting policies involve judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
our accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition ballantyne manufactures or distributes and sells projectors which are highly complex and have many components that make up a complete system  which is referred to as an integrated system 
each customer selects options for certain components in determining the integrated system they chose to purchase 
to recognize revenue  we follow the requirements of asc subtopic  revenue recognition general  which consists of determining that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller price to the buyer is fixed or determinable collectability is reasonably assured once the customer has determined the features for their integrated system  we either manufacture or integrate the system to their preference and then ship the system when it is complete 
revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of the product to the third party 
in those limited situations where the shipping terms are fob destination point  we recognize revenue when the product is delivered 
for services  primarily installation and maintenance related  revenue is recognized when the services have been rendered 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments about the credit worthiness of both current and prospective customers based on ongoing credit evaluations performed by our credit department 
these evaluations include  but are not limited to  reviewing customers prior payment history  analyzing credit applications  monitoring the aging of receivables from current customers and reviewing financial statements  if applicable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is developed based on several factors including overall customer credit quality  historical write off experience and a specific account analysis that project the ultimate collectability of the accounts 
these factors may change over time causing the reserve level to adjust accordingly 
when it is determined that a customer is unlikely to pay  a charge is recorded to bad debt 
table of contents expense in the consolidated statements of operations and the allowance for doubtful accounts is increased 
when it becomes certain the customer cannot pay  the receivable is written off by removing the accounts receivable amount and reducing the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly 
at december   there were approximately million in gross outstanding receivables and million recorded in the allowance for doubtful accounts to cover potential future customer non payments 
at december   there were approximately million in gross outstanding accounts receivable and million recorded in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if economic conditions deteriorate significantly or if one of our large customers were to declare bankruptcy  a larger allowance for doubtful accounts might be necessary 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market and include appropriate elements of material  labor and overhead 
our policy is to evaluate all inventory quantities for amounts on hand that are potentially in excess of estimated usage requirements  and to write down any excess quantities to estimated net realizable value 
inherent in the estimates of net realizable values are management estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules  customer demand and the development of digital technology  which could make our theatre products obsolete  among other items 
management has managed these risks in the past and believes that it can manage them in the future  however  operating margins may suffer if they are unable to effectively manage these risks 
at december  we had recorded gross inventory of approximately million and million of inventory reserves 
this compared to million and million  respectively  at december  warranty our products must meet certain product quality and performance criteria 
in addition to known claims or warranty issues  we estimate future claims on recent sales and the length of the warranty period 
we rely on historical product claims data to estimate the cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
in determining the accrual for the estimated cost of warranty claims  we consider experience with costs for replacement parts  costs of scrapping defective products  the number of product units subject to warranty claims length of the warranty period and other direct costs associated with warranty claims 
if the cost to repair a product or the number of products subject to warranty claims is greater than originally estimated  our accrued cost for warranty claims would increase 
at december   the warranty accrual amounted to million and amounts charged to expense were million 
at december   the warranty accrual amounted to million and amounts charged to expense were million 
the increase in expense during pertains primarily to the increasing business in our china subsidiaries 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance related to the accounting for variable interest entities vie 
the guidance requires reporting entities to evaluate former qualifying special purpose entities qspe for consolidation and changes the approach to determining a vie primary beneficiary from a quantitative assessment to a qualitative assessment designed to identify a controlling financial interest 
the guidance was effective as of the beginning of a company first fiscal year that begins after november  the adoption did not impact the condensed consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to accounting for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this guidance amends asc to eliminate the requirement that all undelivered elements have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence 
table of contents tpe before an entity can recognize the portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
the guidance is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption did not materially impact the condensed consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the accounting for fair value measurements and disclosures topic 
the guidance enhances disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements 
certain provisions of the guidance are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december  and others for fiscal years beginning after december  beginning with the quarter ended march  we provided new disclosures  as applicable  to the fair value instruments discussion 
the disclosures required for fiscal periods beginning after december  are currently not applicable to our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks affecting us are exposure to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we market our products throughout the united states and the world 
as a result  we could be adversely affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency rates and weak economic conditions 
as a majority of our sales are currently denominated in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar can and sometimes has made our products less competitive in foreign markets 
interest rates we have a variable interest rate credit facility  however  we have no outstanding balances as of december  if we would borrow up to the maximum amount available under these facilities  a one percent increase in the interest rate would increase interest expense by million per annum 
interest rate risks from our other interest related accounts such as our postretirement obligations are not deemed significant 
foreign exchange exposures to transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity functional currency are primarily related to our china and canadian subsidiaries 
from time to time  as market conditions indicate  we will enter into foreign currency contracts to manage the risks associated with forecasted transactions 
a portion of our cash in the china and canadian subsidiaries is denominated in foreign currencies  where fluctuations in exchange rates will impact our cash balances in us dollar terms 
a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar would impact our reported cash balance by approximately million
