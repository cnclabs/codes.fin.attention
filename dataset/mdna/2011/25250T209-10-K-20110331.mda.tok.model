research and development expenses totaled million for and million for customers our target customers include both direct service providers as well as enterprise customers and indirect channel partners such as tems  isvs  vars  and sis engaged in the sale of communications technology equipment to enterprise and service provider end customers 
our global presence allows us to distribute our products and support our customers worldwide 
in  we sold our solutions to over customers in over countries who then directly implemented our products or integrated our products into solutions sold to nearly  end users 
revenue from customers located outside of the united states represented of our total revenue in and of our total revenue in for the years ended december  and  scansource  our largest distributor in the united states  accounted for and  respectively  of our total revenues 
competition the market for communications enabling technology solutions and communication solutions is highly competitive and characterized by continuous technological change 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry include product features  price  customer service including technical support and product warranty  and product availability 
we believe that we compete favorably within each of these categories 
we compete with a number of vendors across our various product lines including acme packet  inc  alcatel lucent  audiocodes ltd  cisco systems  inc genband inc  huawei technologies co 
ltd  radisys corporation and sonus networks  inc  among others 
intellectual property our success and ability to compete within our industry is dependent in part on our ability to develop  maintain and protect our technology via intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of us and foreign patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law  
table of contents as well as agreements and contracts  for safeguarding our technology and to endeavor to protect us against claims initiated by others relating to intellectual property 
our general policy has been to seek to patent inventions relating to technology that we expect to incorporate in our products and or that we believe may be otherwise of value within our industry 
we have an internal invention disclosure process and patent committee to identify and evaluate inventions developed by our employees and to determine which of these inventions we will seek to patent 
as of december   we owned approximately issued us patents  approximately issued foreign patents within patent families  and have approximately patent applications pending worldwide 
our already issued patents and any patents that may be granted on our currently pending patent applications shall expire over the course of the next approximately years 
we also have registered trademarks and pending applications to seek trademark registrations in the united states and various foreign countries of perceived interest and or relevance 
among the registered trademarks are those for brands  such as dialogic  brooktrout  i gate  and diva  under which we sell certain products 
patents  by definition  have a fixed term  and the terms of some of our patents have already expired 
as this continues to occur  and although we strive to offset the expiration of patents by obtaining new patents and filing new patent applications  technology covered by the expiring patents will no longer be patented and  as discussed further in risk factors  the expiration of a patent can result in increased competition and an adverse impact on revenues  cash flows and earnings 
trademarks do not have a fixed term  however  we expect to allow some of our current registered and pending trademarks to expire or become abandoned in the coming years  and although it is possible that such expiration could carry with it associated risks  it is expected that such risks will be minimal  if any  to the extent that such trademarks relate to company names  such as veraz  cantata and nms communications  which are no longer focal points in selling and marketing our products 
manufacturing and suppliers we use a combination of internal and external manufacturing 
we use third party contract manufacturers to produce our electronics  which are then configured and distributed from our internal facilities 
we also produce a number of products using a direct fulfillment model  which we are expanding to other products 
our integration and distribution facilities are situated in parsippany  new jersey  needham  massachusetts and hyannis  massachusetts in the us and internationally in dublin  ireland and petach tikva  israel 
our quality management system is certified to iso and includes both product development facilities and manufacturing facilities 
in addition  our environment management system is certified to iso for the facilities listed above 
our primary contract manufacturers are based in wisconsin  usa  ontario  canada  penang  malaysia  and migdal haemek  israel 
all of these manufacturers are certified to iso  and the facilities in wisconsin  israel and malaysia are also certified to iso employees as of december   we had a total of employees  including in sales  marketing and services  in research and development  in manufacturing operations and quality assurance and in a general and administrative capacity 
we had employees in the united states and canada and employees in the rest of the world  with the majority of such non north american employees being located in europe and asia 
we also employ a number of temporary employees and consultants on a contract basis 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment except in locations where all employees are generally part of a collective bargaining agreement  such as france and brazil 
as required in certain foreign countries  national collective agreements may apply to certain of our employees 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good

table of contents item a 
risk factors we have received a letter regarding an informal inquiry by the sec  and cooperation with such governmental inquiry may cost significant amounts of money and require a substantial amount of management resources 
on march   we received a letter from the sec informing us that the sec was conducting an informal inquiry  or sec inquiry  and requesting that we preserve certain categories of records in connection with the sec inquiry 
in a follow up discussion with the sec on march   the sec informed us that the inquiry related to allegations of improper revenue recognition and potential fcpa violations of the former veraz networks inc business during periods prior to completion of our business combination with dialogic corporation 
we may incur significant costs related to the governmental inquiry  which will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
further  the governmental inquiry may cause a diversion of management s time and attention which could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
an informal inquiry by the sec may result in charges filed against us and in fines or penalties 
as a result of the sec inquiry  criminal or civil charges could be filed against us and we could be required to pay significant fines or penalties in connection with the governmental inquiry or other governmental investigations 
any criminal or civil charges by the sec or other governmental agency or any fines or penalties imposed by the sec could materially harm our business  results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we are dependent on revenue from mature products  including tdm products 
our success depends in large part on continued migration to an ip network architecture for communications and sales of our newer ip and ip enabled products portfolio 
if the migration to ip networks does not occur or if it occurs more slowly than we expect or if sales of our newer products do not develop as expected  our operating results would be harmed 
currently  we derive a significant portion of our product revenue from tdm media processing boards 
these products connect to and interact with an enterprise or service provider based circuit switched network and support some or all of a suite of media processing features  including echo cancellation  dtmf detection  voice play and record  conferencing  fax  modem  speech integration  and monitoring 
this business has been declining as networks increasingly deploy packet based technology 
this technology migration resulted in a decrease in sales of our tdm products over the last several years 
if we are unable to develop substantial revenue from our newer packet based product lines  our business and results of operations will suffer 
although we have developed a migration path to broadband based ip products  the tdm products remain a sizable portion of our revenue 
if our migration path to broadband based ip products is unsuccessful  we may not be able to mitigate the revenue loss due to the decrease in sales of its tdm products 
our ip and ip enabled products are used by service providers and enterprises to deliver communications over ip networks 
our success depends on the continued migration of customers a single ip network architecture  which depends on a number of factors outside of our control 
for example  service providers may not see the value in our new mobile backhaul bandwidth optimization products or session bandwidth controller and may decide to delay or forgo making purchases altogether 
further existing networks include switches and other equipment that may have remaining useful lives of or more years  and therefore may continue to operate reliably for a lengthy period of time 
other factors that may delay or speed the migration to ip networks include service providers concerns regarding initial capital outlay requirements  available capacity on legacy networks  competitive and regulatory issues  and the implementation of an enhanced services business and video model 
as a result  customers may defer investing in products such as ours that are designed to migrate communications to ip networks 
if the migration to ip networks does not occur for these or other reasons  or if it occurs more slowly than we expect  our operating results will be harmed 
the price of our common stock has been highly volatile due to factors that will continue to affect the price of our stock our common stock traded as high as and as low as per share during some of the factors leading to this volatility include fluctuations in our quarterly revenue and operating results  announcements of product releases by us or our competitors  announcements of acquisitions and or partnerships by us or our competitors  increases in outstanding shares of our common stock upon exercise or conversion of derivative securities such as stock options and restricted stock units and the subsequent sale of such stock relating to the payment of taxes  delays in producing finished goods inventory for shipment  market conditions in the telecommunications industry  
table of contents issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations  deviations in our operating results from the estimates of analysts  additions or departures of key personnel  and the small public float of our outstanding common stock in the marketplace 
the price of our common stock may continue to be volatile in the future 
difficult conditions in the domestic and international economies generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations and we do not expect these conditions to improve in the near future 
declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have resulted in an economic slowdown and a global recession 
continuing market upheavals  including specifically the lack of credit currently available in the market  may have an adverse effect on us because we are dependent on capital budgets and confidence of our customers  and some of our customers are dependent on obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products 
our revenues have declined and are likely to continue to decline in such circumstances 
factors such as business investment  and the volatility and strength of the capital markets affect the business and economic environment and  ultimately  the amount and profitability of our business 
in an economic slowdown characterized by higher unemployment  lower family income  lower corporate earnings  lower business investment  more volatile capital markets  fewer options to obtain credit and lower consumer spending  the demand for our products could be adversely affected 
adverse changes in the economy and continuing recession could affect earnings negatively and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
our integration of dialogic corporation could result in disruptions in business  loss of customers or contracts or other adverse effects 
our integration of the operations of dialogic corporation may cause disruptions  including potential loss of customers and other business partners  in our business  which could have material adverse effects on our business and operations 
although we believe that our business relationships are stable following consummation of our business combination with dialogic corporation  our customers  and other business partners  in response to the completion of our business combination with dialogic corporation  may adversely change or terminate their relationships with us  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
the demand for our solutions depends in large part on continued capital spending in the telecommunications equipment industry 
a decline in demand  or a decrease or delay in capital spending by service providers  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are exposed to the risks associated with the volatility of the us and global economies  including specifically the continued volatility in certain global markets  such as portugal  italy  greece  russia and spain where we have historically successfully sold our products 
the difficulty in obtaining credit in these markets and decreased visibility regarding whether or when there will be sustained growth periods for sales of our products in these and other markets and uncertainty regarding the amount of sales  since our customers may rely on lending arrangements and or have limited resources to finance capital technology expenditures  may have an adverse effect on our business and operations 
in addition  it is expected that this recent economic turmoil and the resulting economic uncertainty will result in decreased consumer spending  which will likely reduce the need for our products from customers 
slow or negative growth in the global economy may continue to materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations for the foreseeable future 
our results of operations would be further adversely affected if we were to experience lower than anticipated order levels  cancellations of orders in backlog  extended customer delivery requirements  or pricing pressure as a result of the slowdown 
in addition to the potential decline in capital spending resulting from the volatility markets  capital spending in the telecommunications equipment industry has in the past  and may in the future  fluctuate significantly based on numerous factors  including capital spending levels of service providers  competition among service providers  pricing pressures in the telecommunications equipment market  end user demand for new services  service providers emphasis on generating revenues from traditional infrastructure instead of migrating to emerging networks and technologies  lack of or evolving industry standards  
table of contents consolidation in the telecommunications industry  and changes in the regulation of communications services 
we cannot make assurances of the rate or extent to which the telecommunications equipment industry will grow  if at all 
demand for our solutions and our ip products in particular will depend on the magnitude and timing of capital spending by service providers as they extend and migrate their networks 
furthermore  industry growth rates may not be as forecast  resulting in spending on product development well ahead of market requirements 
the telecommunications equipment industry from time to time has experienced  and appears to be currently experiencing  a downturn 
in response to the current downturn  service providers have slowed their capital expenditures  and may also cancel or delay new developments  reduce their workforces and inventories and take a cautious approach to acquiring new equipment and technologies  which could have a negative impact on our business 
a continued downturn in the telecommunications industry may cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period  which also may increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and harm our business 
although we have undertaken a concerted effort to reduce costs  including restructuring efforts  to streamline our operations and to reduce our overall cash burn rate  we have not had sustained profits and our losses could continue 
for the fiscal year ended december   we used million to fund our operating activities 
immediately prior to completion of our business combination with dialogic corporation and as part of the integration of the operations of dialogic corporation  we undertook restructuring initiatives involving the elimination of approximately positions through reductions in force affecting all departments 
dialogic corporation and dialogic inc both also undertook efforts to reduce headcount and streamline operations in and we have continued to focus significant efforts on reducing costs during we may not be able to reduce spending as planned and unanticipated costs will not occur 
any restructuring efforts to focus on key products may not prove successful due to a variety of factors  including risks that a smaller workforce may have difficulty successfully completing research and development efforts and adequately monitoring our development and commercialization efforts 
in addition  we may  in the future  decide to restructure operations and further reduce expenses by taking such measures as additional reductions in our workforce and reductions in other spending 
any restructuring places a substantial strain on remaining management and employees and on operational resources  and there is a risk that our business will be adversely affected by the diversion of management time to the restructuring efforts 
there can be no assurance that following this restructuring we will have sufficient cash resources to allow us to fund our operations as planned 
we have not had sustained profits and our losses could continue 
we have experienced significant losses in the past and never sustained profits 
for the fiscal years ended december  and  we recorded net losses of approximately million and million  respectively 
while we have been able to generate sufficient cash to fund our operations in the past  we may not generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operating commitments in the future 
our leverage limits our flexibility and increases our risk of default 
as of december   we had million in total long term debt outstanding 
our degree of leverage could have important consequences to its investors  such as limiting our ability to obtain additional financing we may need to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  product development  acquisitions or other corporate requirements  and requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt  which would reduce the availability of cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  product development  acquisitions and other corporate requirements 
in addition  the instruments governing our debt contain financial and other restrictive covenants  which limit our operating flexibility and could prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities 
our failure to comply with these covenants may result in an event of default 
if such event of default is not cured or waived  we may suffer adverse effects on our operations  business or financial condition  including acceleration of our debt 
we have obtained written confirmation from our primary lender that they will not accelerate the principal amounts outstanding under the term loan for any reason prior to january  we have no internal hardware manufacturing capabilities and depend exclusively upon contract manufacturers to manufacture our hardware products 
our failure to successfully manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers would impair our ability to deliver our products in a manner consistent with required volumes or delivery schedules  which would likely cause us to fail to meet the demands of our customers and damage our customer relationships 
we outsource the manufacturing of all of our hardware products to a number of subcontractors including jabil circuit  inc  sigmapoint technologies  inc  plexus corp  flextronics  eci telecom and smtc manufacturing corp 
these contract 
table of contents manufacturers provide comprehensive manufacturing services  including the assembly of our products and the procurement of materials and components 
each of our contract manufacturers also builds products for other companies and may not always have sufficient quantities of inventory available or may not allocate their internal resources to fill our orders on a timely basis 
we have supply contracts in place with each of these subcontractors and have done our best to negotiate terms which protect our business 
however  all of these contracts can be terminated by subcontractors following a reasonable notice period pursuant to the terms of each individual contract 
we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities to meet our customers demands and cannot assure you that we will be able to develop or contract for additional manufacturing capacity on acceptable terms on a timely basis or at all if it is needed 
an inability to manufacture our products at a cost comparable to our historical costs could impact our gross margins or force us to raise prices  affecting customer relationships and our competitive position 
qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing commercial scale production is expensive and time consuming and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our products 
if our contract manufacturers are not able to maintain our high standards of quality  increase capacity as needed  or are forced to shut down a factory  our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis may decline  which would damage our relationships with customers  decrease our revenues and negatively impact our growth 
our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting do not guarantee the absence of error or fraud 
disclosure controls are procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the exchange act is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms 
disclosure controls are also designed to ensure that the information is accumulated and communicated to our management  including the ceo and cfo  as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
internal controls over financial reporting  or internal controls  are procedures which are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us gaap and includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap  and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements 
dialogic corporation s management and kpmg llp located in canada  or kpmg canada  identified a material weakness and significant deficiencies in dialogic corporation s internal controls for the year ended december  during the year ended december   dialogic corporation was a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources for designing and implementing internal controls 
in connection with the audit of dialogic corporation s financial statements for the year ended december   dialogic corporation s management and kpmg canada identified a material weakness  as defined under the sec rules and regulations 
the following material weakness was identified  which results from the accumulation of certain significant deficiencies identified during the audit ineffective processes and controls over the accounting for and reporting of transactions in the sales and inventory processes 
specifically  it was noted that there was a lack of sufficient accounting and finance personnel to perform in depth analysis and review of accounting matters within the timeframes set by dialogic corporation s management for finalizing its financial statements 
this weakness resulted in certain adjustments to the amounts or disclosures of the following items revenues and deferred revenue  inventories  warranty provisions  net income and accumulated deficit 
in addition  the following significant deficiencies were identified a lack of methodology for determining sales returns other than stock rotation  inadequate methodology for determining warranty provision  cut off errors in timing of revenue recognition  and incomplete methodology for determining inventory obsolescence 
our management and kpmg llp located in the united states  or kpmg llp  identified a material weakness and significant deficiencies in our internal controls for the year ended december  in connection with the audit of our financial statements for the year ended december   our management and kpmg llp identified a material weakness 
the following material weakness was identified  which results from the aggregation of certain significant deficiencies identified during the audit insufficient staff with technical accounting expertise to apply accounting requirements  as they relate to non routine and highly complex transactions  in accordance with us gaap 
specifically  it was noted that there was a lack of sufficient accounting and finance personnel to perform in depth analysis and review of accounting matters within the timeframes set by our management for finalizing our financial statements 
this weakness resulted in certain audit adjustments to the amounts or disclosures of the following items 
table of contents inventory reserves  debt issuance costs  stock based compensation expenses and restructuring expenses 
because of this material weakness  management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal controls as of december  based on criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organization of the treadway commission in internal control integrated framework 
both before and after our business combination with dialogic corporation  we took measures to remediate the material weakness and significant deficiencies but these remediation efforts are not yet completed 
these measures are broadly grouped into the following categories a increasing finance staff with technical accounting expertise  b improving training  and c implementing appropriate internal control processes 
personnel in dialogic corporation added a new worldwide controller with significant public company experience 
as a result of our business combination with dialogic corporation  our global finance staff increased to more than employees including employees with significant technical accounting and financial reporting backgrounds  significant tax  treasury and financial planning and analysis skills 
in early  we further strengthened the finance team with the addition of a new revenue recognition manager 
we plan to continue to evaluate our personnel needs and hire experienced and qualified employees as appropriate 
training members of our team routinely participate in training relating to stock administration  revenue recognition and additional new accounting developments 
further  as a result of the business combination with dialogic corporation  we have commenced a process of providing cross training between the finance team that was previously part of the dialogic corporation group and the finance team that was previously part of the veraz networks inc finance team 
internal process we have steadily made improvements in our internal processes 
the objective of such internal process improvements has been to remediate the material weaknesses and significant deficiencies  and achieve an overall improvement in internal controls over financial reporting 
such process improvements have included  but are not limited to  the establishment of a centralized electronic database of key contracts  accounting records and related documentation  increased uniformity and consistency with respect to customer contracts  accounting records and related documentation  and increased level of management review of key processes  particularly the revenue cycle and sales process 
we plan to continue to evaluate our internal controls and make improvements as appropriate 
our management  including our ceo and cfo  do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the controls 
the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and we cannot make assurances that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
we face intense competition from the leading telecommunications networking companies in the world as well as from emerging companies 
if we are unable to compete effectively  we might not be able to achieve sufficient market penetration  revenue growth  or profitability 
competition in the market for our products is intense 
this market has historically been dominated by established telephony equipment providers such as alcatel lucent 
we also face competition from other telecommunications and networking companies  including acme packet  inc  audiocodes ltd  cisco systems  inc 
genband inc  radisys corporation and sonus networks  inc  among others 
while some of the established competitors are exiting the market  we are seeing increasingly intense competition from huawei technologies co 
ltd  which leverages its broad product portfolio and significant financial resources to compete with us for our switching business 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater selling and marketing  technical  manufacturing  financial  governmental  and other resources available to them  allowing them to offer a more diversified bundle of products and services 
in some cases  our competitors have undercut the pricing of our products or provided more favorable financing terms  which has made us uncompetitive or forced us to reduce our average selling prices  negatively impacting our margins 
further  some of our competitors sell significant amounts of other products to our current and prospective customers 
in addition  some potential customers when selecting equipment vendors to provide fundamental infrastructure products prefer to purchase from larger  established vendors 
our competitors broad product portfolios  coupled with already existing relationships  may cause our customers or potential customers to buy our competitors products or harm our ability to attract new customers 

table of contents to compete effectively  we must deliver innovative products that provide extremely high reliability  compression rates  and voice quality  scale and deploy easily and efficiently  interoperate with existing network designs and other vendors equipment  support existing and emerging industry  national  and international standards  provide effective network management  are accompanied by comprehensive customer support and professional services  provide a cost effective and space efficient solution for service providers  and offer a broad array of services 
additionally  we compete with a number of companies and divisions of companies that focus on providing one or more aspects of communication enabling technology  including  but not limited to  audiocodes limited  radisys corporation  movius interactive corporation  cisco systems  inc  network equipment technologies  inc  genband inc  dilithium networks  ripcode  inc  radvision ltd 
and huawei technologies co  ltd 
some of our competitors and potential competitors may have a number of significant advantages over us  including a longer operating history  greater name recognition and marketing power  preferred vendor status with our existing and potential customers  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  which allow them to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies and customer requirements  and lower cost structures 
if we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors  we could experience reduced gross profit margins  price reductions  order cancellations  and loss of customers and revenues  each of which would adversely impact our business 
furthermore  existing or potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships with each other or with third parties or adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 
as a result of increased competition  we could encounter significant pricing pressures and or suffer losses in market share 
these pricing pressures could result in significantly lower average selling prices for its products 
we may not be able to offset the effects of any price reductions with an increase in the number of customers  cost reductions or otherwise 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future  which could lead to volatility in the price of our common stock 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and they may continue to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
from our experience  customer purchases of telecommunications equipment have been unpredictable and these purchases are made as customers build out their networks  rather than regular  recurring purchases 
the primary factors that may affect our quarterly revenues and results include the following fluctuation in demand for our products and the timing and size of customer orders  the length and variability of the sales cycle for our products  new product introductions and enhancements by our competitors and us  our ability to develop  introduce  and ship new products and product enhancements that meet customer requirements in a timely manner  the mix of products sold such as between ngn sales and sales of bandwidth optimization products or between service provider and enterprise markets  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components  our ability to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products  
table of contents costs related to acquisitions of complementary products  technologies  or businesses  changes in our pricing policies  the pricing policies of our competitors  and the prices of the components of our products  the timing of revenue recognition  amount of deferred revenues  and receivables collections  difficulties or delays in deployment of customer ip networks that would delay anticipated customer purchases of additional products and services  general economic conditions  as well as those specific to the telecommunications  networking  and related industries  consolidation within the telecommunications industry  including acquisitions of or by our customers  and the failure of certain of our customers to successfully and timely reorganize their operations  including emerging from bankruptcy 
in addition  we may be unable to recognize all of the revenue associated with certain customer contracts in the same period as the costs associated with those contracts are expensed  which could cause our quarterly gross margins  particularly of ip gross margins  to fluctuate significantly 
further  us gaap may require that revenue related to certain customer contracts be delayed for periods of a year or more 
this delay may cause spikes in our revenue in quarters when it is recognized and may result in deferred revenue to revenue conversion taking longer than anticipated 
a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term 
if revenues for a particular quarter are below expectations  we may not be able to reduce operating expenses proportionally for that quarter 
therefore  any such revenue shortfall would likely have a direct negative effect on our operating results for that quarter 
for these and other reasons  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
we believe it possible that in some future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which may adversely affect our stock price 
a decline in the market price of our common stock could cause our stockholders to lose some or all of their investment and may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain employees and raise capital 
in addition  such a decline in our stock price may cause stockholders to initiate securities class action lawsuits 
whether or not meritorious  litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and diversion of time and attention of our management 
our insurance to cover claims of this sort  if brought  may not be adequate 
the ownership of our common stock is highly concentrated  and your interests may conflict with the interests of our existing stockholders 
our executive officers  directors or former directors  and certain of our affiliates beneficially owned or controlled approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  accordingly  these stockholders  acting as a group  could have significant influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors  any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transaction 
the significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock due to investors perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise 
the largest customers in the telecommunications industry have substantial negotiating leverage  which may require that we agree to terms and conditions that are less advantageous to us than the terms and conditions of our existing customer relationships  or risk limiting our ability to sell our products to these large service providers  thereby harming our operating results 
large telecommunications service providers have substantial purchasing power and leverage negotiating contractual terms and conditions relating to their purchase of our products 
as we seek to sell more products to these large telecommunications providers  we may be required to agree to less favorable terms and conditions to complete such sales  which may result in lower margins  affect the timing of the recognition of the revenue derived from these sales  and the amount of deferred revenues  each of which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
in addition  our future success depends in part on our ability to sell our products to large service providers operating complex networks that serve large numbers of subscribers and transport high volumes of traffic 
the communications industry historically has been dominated by a relatively small number of service providers 
while deregulation and other market forces have led to an increasing number of service providers in recent years  large service providers continue to constitute a significant portion of the market for communications equipment 
if we fail to sell additional ip products to our large customers or to expand our customer base to include additional customers that deploy our products in large scale networks serving significant numbers of subscribers  our revenue growth will be limited 

table of contents consolidation or downturns in the telecommunications industry may affect demand for our products and the pricing of our products  which could limit our growth and may harm our business 
the telecommunications industry  which includes all of our customers  has experienced increased consolidation in recent years  and we expect this trend to continue 
consolidation among our customers and prospective customers may cause delays or reductions in capital expenditure plans and or increased competitive pricing pressures as the number of available customers declines and their relative purchasing power increases in relation to suppliers 
the occurrence of any of these factors  separately or in combination  may lead to decreased sales or slower than expected growth in revenues and could harm our business and operations 
the communications industry is cyclical and reactive to general economic conditions 
in the recent past  worldwide economic downturns  pricing pressures  and deregulation have led to consolidations and reorganizations 
these downturns  pricing pressures and restructurings have been causing delays and reductions in capital and operating expenditures by many service providers 
these delays and reductions  in turn  have been reducing demand for communications products like ours 
a continuation or subsequent recurrence of these industry patterns  as well as general domestic and foreign economic conditions and other factors that reduce spending by companies in the communications industry  could harm our operating results in the future 
if we fail to anticipate and meet specific customer requirements  or if our products fail to interoperate with our customers existing networks or with existing and emerging industry  national  and international standards  we may not be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers 
we must effectively anticipate and adapt our business  products and services in a timely manner to meet customer requirements 
we must also meet existing and emerging industry  national and international standards to meet changing customer demands 
prospective customers may require product features and capabilities that are not included in our current product offerings 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires that we carefully manage the transition from our older products to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns and ensure that adequate supplies of our new products can be delivered to meet anticipated customer demand 
if we fail to develop products and offer services that satisfy customer requirements  or if we fail to effectively manage the transition from our older products to our new or enhanced products  our ability to create or increase demand for our products would be seriously harmed and we may lose current and prospective customers  thereby harming our business 
many of our customers will require that our products be designed to interface with their existing networks or with existing or emerging industry  national  and international standards  each of which may have different and unique specifications 
issues caused by a failure to achieve homologation to certain standards or an unanticipated lack of interoperability between our products and these existing networks may result in significant warranty  support  and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our hardware and software development efforts  and cause significant customer relations problems 
if our products do not interoperate with our customers respective networks or applicable standards  installations could be delayed or orders for our products could be cancelled  which would seriously harm our gross margins and result in the loss of revenues and or customers 
if we do not respond rapidly to technological changes or to changes in industry standards  our products could become obsolete 
the market for ip infrastructure products and services is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving standards 
we may be unable to respond quickly or effectively to these developments 
we may experience difficulties with software development  hardware design  manufacturing  marketing  or certification that could delay or prevent our development  introduction  or marketing of new products and enhancements 
the introduction of new products by our competitors  the market acceptance of products based on new or alternative technologies or the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing or future products obsolete 
if the standards adopted are different from those that we have chosen to support  market acceptance of our products may be significantly reduced or delayed 
if our products become technologically obsolete  we may be unable to sell our products in the marketplace and generate revenues  and our business could be adversely affected 
because our products are sophisticated and designed to be deployed in complex environments and in multiple locations  they may have errors or defects that we find only after full deployment 
if these errors lead to customer dissatisfaction or we are unable to establish and maintain a support infrastructure and required support levels to service these complex environments  our business may be seriously harmed 
our products are sophisticated and are designed to be deployed in large and complex networks 
because of the nature of our products  they can only be fully tested when substantially deployed in very large networks with high volumes of traffic 
some of our customers have only recently begun to commercially deploy our products or deploy our products in larger configurations and they may discover errors or defects in the software or hardware  the products may not operate as expected  or our products may not be able to function in the larger configurations required by certain customers 
if we are unable to correct errors or other performance problems that may be identified after full deployment of our products  we could experience cancellation of orders or other losses of or delays in revenues  
table of contents loss of customers and market share  harm to our reputation  a failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance for our products  increased service  support  and warranty costs and a diversion of development resources  increased insurance costs and losses to our business and service provider customers  and costly and time consuming legal actions by our customers 
if we experience warranty failures that indicate either manufacturing or design deficiencies  we may suffer damages 
if we experience warranty failures we may be required to recall units in the field and or stop producing and shipping such products until the deficiency is identified and corrected 
in the event of such warranty failures  our business could be adversely affected resulting in reduced revenue  increased costs and decreased customer satisfaction 
because customers often delay deployment of a full system until they have tested the products and any defects have been corrected  we expect these revisions may cause delays in orders by our customers for our systems 
because our strategy is to introduce more complex products in the future  this risk will intensify over time 
service provider customers have discovered errors in our products 
if the costs of remediating problems experienced by our customers exceed our expected expenses  which historically have not been significant  these costs may adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  because our products are deployed in large and complex networks around the world  our customers expect us to establish a support infrastructure and maintain demanding support standards to ensure that their networks maintain high levels of availability and performance 
to support the continued growth of our business  our support organization will need to provide service and support at a high level throughout the world 
this will include hiring and training customer support engineers both at our primary corporate locations as well as our smaller offices in new geographies  such as central and south america and russia 
if we are unable to provide the expected level of support and service to our customers  we could experience loss of customers and market share  a failure to attract new customers in new geographies  increased service  support  and warranty costs and a diversion of development resources  and network performance penalties 
the long and variable sales and deployment cycles for our products may cause our operating results to vary materially  which could result in a significant unexpected revenue shortfall in any given quarter 
our products  particularly ip switching products  have lengthy sales cycles  which typically extend from three to months and may take up to two years 
a customer s decision to purchase our products often involves a significant commitment of the customer s resources and a product evaluation and qualification process that can vary significantly in length 
the length of our sales cycles also varies depending on the type of customer to which we are selling  the product being sold and the type of network in which our product will be utilized 
we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort during this time  regardless of whether we make a sale 
even after making the decision to purchase our products  our customers may deploy our products slowly 
timing of deployment can vary widely among customers and among product types 
the length of a customer s deployment period will impact our ability to recognize revenue related to such customer s purchase and may also directly affect the timing of any subsequent purchase of additional products by that customer 
as a result of these lengthy and uncertain sales and deployment cycles for our products  it is difficult for us to predict the quarter in which our customers may purchase additional products or features from us  and our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  which may negatively affect our operating results for any given quarter 
we rely on channel partners for a significant portion of our revenue 
our failure to effectively develop and manage these third party distributors  systems integrators  and resellers specifically and our indirect sales channel generally  or disruptions to the processes and procedures that support  our indirect sales channels  could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 
we rely on third party distributors  systems integrators  and resellers for a significant portion of our revenue 
our revenues depend in large part on the performance of these indirect channel partners 
although many aspects of our partner relationships are contractual in nature  our arrangements with our indirect channel partners are not exclusive 
accordingly  important aspects of these relationships depend on the continued cooperation between the parties 

table of contents many factors out of our control could interfere with our ability to market  license  implement or support our products with any of our partners  which in turn could harm our business 
these factors include  but are not limited to  a change in the business strategy of one of our partners  the introduction of competitive product offerings by other companies that are sold through one of our partners  potential contract defaults by one of our partners  or changes in ownership or management of one of our distribution partners 
some of our competitors may have stronger relationships with our distribution partners than we do  and we have limited control  if any  as to whether those partners implement our products rather than our competitors products or whether they devote resources to market and support our competitors products rather than our offerings 
in addition  we recognize a portion of our revenue based on a sell through model using information provided by our partners and recognize a significant portion on a sell in basis  particularly when selling in to established vars  isvs  tems and other partners with whom we have a significant history 
if those partners provide us with inaccurate or untimely information  the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted and our operating results may be harmed 
moreover  if we are unable to leverage our sales and support resources through our distribution partner relationships  we may need to hire and train additional qualified sales and engineering personnel 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to hire additional qualified sales and engineering personnel in these circumstances  and our failure to do so may restrict our ability to generate revenue or implement our products on a timely basis 
even if we are successful in hiring additional qualified sales and engineering personnel  we will incur additional costs and our operating results  including our gross margin  may be adversely affected 
the loss of or reduction in sales by these resellers could reduce our revenues 
if we fail to maintain relationships with these third party resellers  fail to develop new relationships with third party resellers in new markets  fail to manage  train  or provide incentives to existing third party resellers effectively or if these third party resellers are not successful in their sales efforts  sales of our products may decrease and our operating results would suffer 
maintaining and improving our financial controls and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources  divert management s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members 
as a public company  we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act  the sarbanes oxley act and the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq global market  or the nasdaq listing standards 
the requirements of these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs  make some activities more difficult  time consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel  systems and resources 
the exchange act requires  among other things  that we file annual  quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition 
the sarbanes oxley act requires  among other things  that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 
as a public company  our systems of internal controls over financial reporting will be required to be periodically assessed and reported on by management and may be subject to annual audits by our independent auditors 
during the course of our evaluation  we may identify areas requiring improvement  and may be required to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review 
this could result in significant delays and cost to us and require us to divert substantial resources  including management time  from other activities 
as of december   we have identified a material weakness in our internal controls and  as such  our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective 
moreover  effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud 
as a result  our failure to satisfy the requirements of section on a timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which in turn could harm the market value of our common stock 
any failure to maintain effective internal controls also could impair our ability to manage our business and harm our financial results 
under the sarbanes oxley act and nasdaq listing standards  we are required to maintain an independent board 
we also expect these rules and regulations will make it more difficult and more expensive for us to maintain directors and officers liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain coverage 
if we are unable to maintain adequate directors and officers insurance  our ability to recruit and retain qualified directors  especially those directors who may be deemed independent for purposes of nasdaq listing standards  and officers will be significantly curtailed 
our international operations expose us to additional political and economic risks not faced by businesses that operate only in the united states 
we are a multinational company based in the united states with branch offices and representative offices located in many countries around the world 
our manufacturing operations are located in canada  israel  the united states and ireland and we utilize various subcontractors in canada  the united states  israel and malaysia 
we have development locations in canada  the united states  ireland  israel and germany and we have sales offices in many other countries  including china  india  brazil  russia  israel  singapore  malaysia  australia  hong kong  japan  the united kingdom  france  spain  the netherlands  belgium  slovenia and sweden 
approximately half of our sales are generated in markets outside of the americas and we see our largest market growth occurring in foreign countries such as india  brazil  russia and china 
as a result of all these international activities we are subject to worldwide economic and market condition risks generally associated with global trade  such as fluctuating exchange rates  tariff and 
table of contents trade policies  domestic and foreign tax policies  foreign governmental regulations  political unrest  wars and other acts of terrorism and changes in other economic conditions 
we may face risks associated with our international sales that could impair our ability to grow our revenues 
for the fiscal years ended december  and  revenues from outside of the americas were approximately million and million  respectively  or and of our total revenues  respectively 
we intend to continue selling into our existing international markets and expand into additional international markets where we currently do not do business 
if we are unable to continue to sell products effectively in these existing international markets and expand into additional new international markets  our ability to grow our business will be adversely affected 
some factors that may impact our ability to maintain our international operations and sales and or cause our results from operations in these international markets to differ from expectations include difficulty enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable in foreign jurisdictions  leading to longer collection periods  certification and qualification requirements relating to our products  including  by way of example  export licenses that must be obtained from the us department of commerce  the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements  including import and export regulations  and currency exchange rates  certification and qualification requirements for doing business in foreign jurisdictions including both specific requirements imposed by the foreign jurisdictions and protectionist trade legislation in either the united states or other countries  such as a change in the current tariff structures  export compliance laws  trade restrictions resulting from war or terrorism  or other trade policies could adversely affect our ability to sell or to manufacture in international markets as well as us federal and state agency restrictions imposed by the buy american act or the trade agreement act that may apply to our products manufactured outside the united states  inadequate protection for intellectual property rights in certain countries  less stringent adherence to ethical and legal standards by prospective customers in certain foreign countries  including compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act  potentially adverse tax or duty consequences  unfavorable foreign exchange movements  particularly the continued devaluation of the us dollar  which could result in decreased revenues  and political and economic instability 
additionally  as many of our customers are conducting business in emerging markets that can be unpredictable at times due to rapidly changing political and economic conditions  the judgment of management is a significant factor in determining whether an increase in the allowance for uncollectible accounts is warranted 
management considers various factors in making such judgments  including the customer specific circumstances as well as the general political environment  economic conditions and other relevant matters in determining the collectability of the receivables 
we will record a reversal of the allowance if there is significant improvement in collection rates 
historically  the allowance has been adequate to cover the actual losses from uncollectible accounts 
such reversals may negatively impact our results of operations 
if we lose the services of one or more members of our current executive management team or other key employees  or if we are unable to attract additional executives or key employees  we may not be able to execute on our business strategy 
our future success depends in large part upon the continued service of our executive management team and other key employees 
in particular  nick jensen  the chairman of our board of directors and chief executive officer  and douglas sabella  our president and chief operating officer  are critical to the overall management of our business as well as to the development of our culture and our strategic direction 
to be successful  we must also hire  retain and motivate key employees  including those in managerial  technical  marketing  and sales positions 
in particular  our product generation efforts depend on hiring and retaining qualified engineers 
experienced management and technical  sales  marketing and support personnel in the telecommunications and networking industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense 
the loss of services of any of our executives  one or more other members of our executive management or sales team or other key employees  could seriously harm our business 

table of contents we and our contract manufacturers rely on single or limited sources for the supply of some components of our products and if we fail to adequately predict our manufacturing requirements or if our supply of any of these components is disrupted  we will be unable to ship our products on a timely basis  which would likely cause us to fail to meet the demands of our customers and damage our customer relationships 
we and our contract manufacturers currently purchase several key components of our products  including commercial digital signal processors  from single or limited sources 
we purchase these components on a purchase order basis 
if we overestimate our component requirements  we could have excess inventory  which would increase our costs and result in write downs harming our operating results 
if we underestimate our requirements  we may not have an adequate supply  which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and revenues 
we currently do not have long term supply contracts with our component suppliers and they are not required to supply us with products for any specified periods  in any specified quantities  or at any set price  except as may be specified in a particular purchase order 
because the key components and assemblies of our products are complex  difficult to manufacture and require long lead times  in the event of a disruption or delay in supply  or inability to obtain products  we may not be able to develop an alternate source in a timely manner  at favorable prices  or at all 
in addition  during periods of capacity constraint  we are disadvantaged compared to better capitalized companies  as suppliers may in the future choose not to do business with us or may require higher prices or less advantageous terms 
a failure to find acceptable alternative sources could hurt our ability to deliver high quality products to our customers and negatively affect our operating margins 
in addition  reliance on our suppliers exposes us to potential supplier production difficulties or quality variations 
our customers rely upon our ability to meet committed delivery dates  and any disruption in the supply of key components would seriously adversely affect our ability to meet these dates and could result in legal action by our customers  loss of customers  or harm our ability to attract new customers  any of which could decrease our revenues and negatively impact our growth 
failure to manage expenses and inventory risks associated with meeting the demands of our customers may adversely affect our business or results of operations 
to ensure that we are able to meet customer demand for our products  we place orders with our contract manufacturers and suppliers based on our estimates of future sales 
if actual sales differ materially from these estimates because of inaccurate forecasting or as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise  our inventory levels and expenses may be adversely affected and our business and results of operations could suffer 
in addition  to remain competitive  we must continue to introduce new products and processes into our manufacturing environment 
there cannot be any assurance  however  that the introduction of new products will not create obsolete inventories related to older products 
if we are not able to obtain necessary licenses of third party technology at acceptable prices  or at all  our products could become obsolete 
we have incorporated third party licensed technology into our current products 
from time to time  we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements 
third party licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the inability to maintain or re license any third party licenses required in our current products  or to obtain any new third party licenses to develop new products and product enhancements  could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost  and delay or prevent us from making these products or enhancements  any of which could seriously harm the competitiveness of our products 
failures by our strategic partners or by us in integrating our products with those provided by our strategic partners could seriously harm our business 
our solutions include the integration of products supplied by strategic partners  who offer complementary products and services 
we expect to further integrate our ip products with such partner products and services in the future 
we rely on these strategic partners in the timely and successful deployment of our solutions to our customers 
if the products provided by these partners have defects or do not operate as expected  if we do not effectively integrate and support products supplied by these strategic partners  or if these strategic partners fail to be able to support products  we may have difficulty with the deployment of our solutions  which may result in a loss of or delay in recognizing revenues  increased service  support  and warranty costs and a diversion of development resources  and network performance penalties 

table of contents in addition to cooperating with our strategic partners on specific customer projects  we also may compete in some areas with these same partners 
if these strategic partners fail to perform or choose not to cooperate with us on certain projects  in addition to the effects described above  we could experience a loss of customers and market share  and a failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance for our products 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may lose a valuable competitive advantage or be forced to endure costly litigation 
we are a technology dependent company  and our success depends on developing and protecting our intellectual property we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
at the same time  our products are complex and are often not patentable in their entirety 
we also license intellectual property from third parties and rely on those parties to maintain and protect their technology 
we cannot be certain that our actions will protect our proprietary rights 
any patents owned by us may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
any of our patent applications  whether or not being currently challenged  may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek  if at all 
if we are unable to adequately protect our technology  or if we are unable to continue to obtain or maintain licenses for protected technology from third parties  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and significant impairment of intangible assets 
in addition  some of our products are now designed  manufactured and sold outside of the united states and canada 
despite the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property  this international exposure may reduce or limit protection of its intellectual property  which is more prone to design piracy outside of the united states and canada 
we also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology  especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable 
however  trade secrets are difficult to maintain and do not protect technology against independent developments made by third parties 
possible third party claims of infringement of proprietary rights against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation or financial condition 
the telecommunications industry generally and the market for ip telephony products in particular are characterized by a relatively high level of litigation based on allegations of infringement of proprietary rights 
we have received in the past and may receive in the future receive inquiries from other patent holders and may become subject to claims that we infringe their intellectual property rights 
we cannot assure you that we are not in infringement of third party patents 
any parties claiming that our products infringe upon their proprietary rights  regardless of its merits  could force us to license their patents for substantial royalty payments or to defend ourselves  and possibly our customers or contract manufacturers  in litigation 
we may also be required to indemnify our customers and contract manufacturers for damages they suffer as a result of such infringement 
these claims and any resulting licensing arrangement or lawsuit  if successful  could subject us to significant royalty payments or liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights 
any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling  incorporating  or using our products that use the challenged intellectual property  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or redesign those products that use any allegedly infringing technology 
any lawsuits regarding intellectual property rights  regardless of their success  would be time consuming  expensive to resolve and would divert our management s time and attention 
regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and future prospects 
the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by the changes in the regulations relating to the telecommunications industry 
currently  there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to  or delivery of  voice services on ip networks 
we could be adversely affected by regulation of ip networks and commerce in any country  including the united states  where we operate 
such regulations could include matters such as voip or using ip  encryption technology  and access charges for service providers 
the adoption of such regulations could decrease demand for our products  and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating result  and financial condition 
compliance with regulations and standards applicable to our products may be time consuming  difficult and costly  and if we fail to comply  our product sales will decrease 
to achieve and maintain market acceptance  our products must continue to meet a significant number of regulations and standards 
in the united states  our products must comply with various regulations defined by the federal communications commission and 
table of contents underwriters laboratories 
as these regulations and standards evolve  and if new regulations or standards are implemented  we will be required to modify our products or develop and support new versions of our products  and this will increase our costs 
the failure of our products to comply  or delays in compliance  with the various existing and evolving industry regulations and standards could prevent or delay introduction of our products  which could harm our business 
user uncertainty regarding future policies may also affect demand for communications products  including our products 
moreover  distribution partners or customers may require us  or we may otherwise deem it necessary or advisable  to alter our products to address actual or anticipated changes in the regulatory environment 
our inability to alter our products to address these requirements and any regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and operating results 
failure of our hardware products to comply with evolving industry standards and complex government regulations may prevent our hardware products from gaining wide acceptance  which may prevent us from growing our sales 
the market for network equipment products is characterized by the need to support industry standards as different standards emerge  evolve  and achieve acceptance 
we will not be competitive unless we continually introduce new products and product enhancements that meet these emerging standards 
our products must comply with various domestic regulations and standards defined by agencies such as the federal communications commission  in addition to standards established by governmental authorities in various foreign countries and the recommendations of the international telecommunication union 
if we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards or if we fail to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates  we will not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply  which may harm our business 
production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject us to environmental and other regulations including  in some instances  the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life and make us responsible for disposing or recycling products in an environmentally safe manner 
additionally  certain states and countries may pass regulations requiring our products to meet certain requirements to use environmentally friendly components  such as the european union directive ec waste electrical and electronic equipment  or weee  to mandate funding  collection  treatment  recycling  and recovery of weee by producers of electrical or electronic equipment into europe and similar rules and regulations in other countries 
china is in the final approval stage of compliance programs which will harmonize with the european union weee and recycling of hazardous substances directives 
in the future  japan and other countries are expected to adopt environmental compliance programs 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  we may not be able to sell our products in jurisdictions where these regulations apply  which would have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards could adversely affect our operating results 
us gaap is subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  the sec  and various other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles 
a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results  and could affect the reporting of transactions consummated before the announcement of a change 
for example  we recognize our product software license revenue in accordance with software revenue recognition literature or other accounting standards 
the standards may change and the standards setters may continue to issue interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant accounting standards to a wide range of sales contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in software licensing arrangements 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue recognition accounting policies that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may be required to delay revenue recognition into future periods  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in the past we have had to defer recognition of revenue  and may have to do so again in the future 
such deferral may be as a result of several factors  including whether a transaction involves software arrangements that include undelivered elements for which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value  requirements that we deliver services for significant enhancements and modifications to customize our software for a particular customer  material acceptance criteria or other identified product related issues  or payment terms extending beyond our customary terms 
because of these factors and other specific requirements under us gaap for software revenue recognition  we must have very precise terms in our software arrangements to recognize revenue when we initially deliver software or perform services 
negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend our sales cycle  and we sometimes accept terms and conditions that do not permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery 

table of contents our ability  as well as our contract manufacturers ability  to meet customer demand depends largely on our ability to obtain raw materials and a reduction or disruption in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our business 
the continued global economic contraction has caused many of our component suppliers to reduce their manufacturing capacity 
as the global economy improves  our component suppliers are experiencing and will continue to experience supply constraints until they expand capacity to meet increased levels of demand 
these supply constraints may adversely affect the availability and lead times of components for our products 
increased lead times mean we may have to forsake flexibility in aligning its supply to customer demand changes and increase our exposure to excess inventory since we may have to order material earlier and in larger quantities 
further  supply constraints will likely result in increased overall procurement costs as we attempt to meet customer demand requirements 
in addition  these supply constraints may affect our ability  as well as our contract manufacturers ability  to meet customer demand and thus result in missed sales opportunities and a loss of market share  negatively impacting revenues and our overall operating results 
our failure to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis could harm our ability to attract and retain customers 
our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent product introductions and ongoing demands for greater speed and functionality 
therefore  we must continually design  develop and introduce new products with improved features to be competitive 
to introduce these products on a timely basis we must design innovative and performance improving features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors  identify emerging technological trends in our target markets  including new standards for our products  accurately define and design new products to meet market needs  anticipate changes in end user preferences with respect to our customers products  rapidly develop and produce these products at competitive prices  respond effectively to technological changes or product announcements by others  and provide effective technical and post sales support for these new products as they are deployed 
if we are not able to introduce such products on a timely basis  we may not be able to attract and retain customers  which could decrease its revenues and negatively impact its growth 
not all new product designs ramp into production  and even if ramped into production  the timing of such production may not occur as we or our customers had estimated  or the volumes derived from such projects may not be as significant as we had estimated  each of which could have a substantial negative impact on our anticipated revenues and profitability 
our revenue growth expectations for our next generation products are highly dependent upon successful ramping of our design wins 
in some cases there is little time between when a design win is achieved and when production level shipments begin 
with many new design wins  customers may require us to provide enhanced features not on its immediate roadmap 
in addition  customers may require significant time to port their own applications to our products 
adding features to our products to meet customer requests as well as porting of customer specific applications can take six to months 
after that  there is an additional time lag from the start of production ramp to peak revenue 
not all product designs ramp into production and  even if a product ramps into production  the volumes derived from such products and associated projects may be less than we had originally estimated 
customer projects related to design wins are sometimes canceled or delayed  or can perform below original expectations  which can adversely impact anticipated revenues and profitability 
in particular  the volumes and time to production ramp associated with new design wins depend on the adoption rate of new technologies in its customers end markets  especially in the communications networking sector 
program delays or cancellations could be more frequent during times of meaningful economic downturn 
our business depends on conditions in the communications networks and commercial systems markets 
demand in these markets can be cyclical and volatile  and any inability to sell products to these markets or forecast customer demand due to unfavorable or volatile market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and gross margin 
we derive our revenues from a number of diverse end markets  some of which are subject to significant cyclical changes in demand 
in  we derived our revenues from both the enterprise and service provider markets  and we believe that our revenues will continue to be derived primarily from these two markets 
in many instances  our products are building blocks for its customers products and as such  our customers are not the end users of our products 
if our customers experience adverse economic conditions in the end markets into which they sell our products  we would expect a significant reduction in spending by our customers 
some of these end markets are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change and economic uncertainty 
our exposure to economic cyclicality and any related fluctuation in customer demand in these end markets could have a material adverse effect on its revenues and financial condition 

table of contents increased political  economic and social instability in the middle east may adversely affect our business and operating results 
the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility  including the wars in afghanistan  iraq  and libya  threats against israel and the recent israeli conflict in gaza  have created uncertainty throughout the middle east and have significantly increased the political  economic  and social instability in israel  where some of our products are manufactured 
acts of terrorism  either domestically or abroad and particularly in israel  or a resumption of the confrontation along the northern border of israel  would likely create further uncertainties and instability 
to the extent terrorism  or the political  economic or social instability results in a disruption of our operations or delays in our manufacturing or shipment of our products  then our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our i gate media gateways and our dcme products are exclusively manufactured for us by flextronics  with the dcme products being manufactured by flextronics through our relationship with eci 
the flextronics manufacturing facility is located in migdal haemek  israel  which is located in northern israel 
while flextronics has other locations across the world at which our manufacturing requirements may be fulfilled and we are in the process of diversifying our manufacturing capabilities to locations outside of the middle east  any disruption to its israeli manufacturing capabilities in migdal haemek would likely cause a material delay in our manufacturing process 
if we are forced or if we decide to switch the manufacture of our products to a different flextronics facility  the time and expense of such switch along with the increased costs  if any  of operating in another location  would adversely affect our operations 
in addition  while we expect that flextronics will have the capacity to manufacture our products at facilities outside of israel  there can be no assurance that such capacity will be available when we require it or upon terms favorable or acceptable to us 
to the extent terrorism or political  economic or social instability results in a disruption of flextronics manufacturing facilities in israel or eci operations in israel as they relate to our business  then our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  any hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners  or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel  could adversely affect our operations and product development  cause our revenues to decrease  and adversely affect the price of our shares 
furthermore  several countries  principally in the middle east  still restrict doing business with israel  israeli companies or companies with operations in israel 
should additional countries impose restrictions on doing business with israel  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our operations may be disrupted by the obligations of our personnel to perform military service 
many of our employees in israel  including certain key employees  are obligated to perform up to one month in some cases more of annual military reserve duty until they reach age and  in emergency circumstances  could be called to active duty 
recently  there have been call ups of military reservists  including several of our employees  and it is possible that there will be additional call ups in the future 
our operations could be disrupted by the absence of a significant number of our employees due to military service or the absence for extended periods of one or more of our key employees for military service 
such disruption could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we have a material amount of intangible assets and goodwill which  if they become impaired  would result in an impairment loss 
current accounting standards require that goodwill be evaluated for impairment at least annually and that long lived assets such as intangible assets be evaluated periodically if there are any triggering events 
we have million of intangible assets  net and million of goodwill as of december   respectively  that have originated from our acquisitions of intel s media and signaling business in  eas in  and the nms cp business acquired in and the reverse acquisition of dialogic corporation in while we have not had any impairment losses for our intangible assets and goodwill  any future impairment of our intangible assets or goodwill would have a negative impact on our operating results 
there are a number of trends and factors affecting our markets  including economic conditions in specific countries  regions and globally  which are outside our control 
these trends and factors may result in increasing upward pressure on the costs of products and an overall reduction in demand 
there are trends and factors affecting our markets and our sources of supply that are beyond our control and may negatively affect our cost of sales 
such trends and factors include adverse changes in the cost of raw commodities and increasing freight  energy  and labor costs in developing regions 
our business strategy has been to provide customers with faster time to market and greater value solutions to help them compete in an industry that generally faces downward pricing pressure 
in addition  our competitors have in the past lowered  and may again in the future lower  prices to increase their market share  which would ultimately reduce the price we may realize from its customers 
if we are unable to realize prices that allow us to continue to compete on this basis of performance  its profit margin  market share  and overall financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents the deployment of advanced wireless networks may not proceed according to analyst projections and even if it does  the adoption of mobile video added services may not occur 
the successful deployment of advanced g and g wireless networks would significantly impact the deployment of video gateway infrastructure 
since our ability to increase revenue is partially dependent on video gateways and video media servers that attach to the advanced g and g wireless networks  delay in the deployment of g and g wireless networks would impact our ability to increase revenue 
additionally  even if the advanced wireless networks are deployed successfully  the use of mobile video value added services including video ring tones  video with interactive voice response  video location based services and video chat may not be widely adopted 
if the deployment of advanced wireless networks does not proceed according to analyst projections or if mobile video added services are not widely adopted  the growth of our business could be negatively affected 
the success of our voip gateways is dependent upon the successful deployment of technology by other companies and any delay in the deployment of such technology would negatively impact the growth of our enterprise gateway business 
our voip gateways are used to connect software based ip pbxs such as microsoft office communications server and ibm sametime  which are currently in the process of being deployed  to existing legacy systems 
any delay in the deployment of the ip pbx could impact our revenues from products related to our voip gateways 
the conversion to certain new technology may result in some customers utilizing other products or developing their own technology 
we are in the process of converting certain of our media enabling components from a board based product to our hmp software product that can be deployed on the host central processing unit of the server 
the cost of entry for an hmp based software product is significantly lower than that of a board based product 
as a result  there is a risk that our board based customers may utilize alternative producers of media enabling components or develop their own software product 
the loss of customers during this conversion would negatively impact our revenue and operating results 
as our product lines age  we may be required to redesign our products or make substantial purchases of end of life components 
we sell multiple product lines that have been in production for several years 
in some instances the production of components that are used in the manufacturing of our products have been terminated or will be terminated 
such termination of production requires that we must either incur the additional costs of purchasing a significant amount of such components prior to their termination or we must invest in significant engineering efforts to redesign the product  either of which would adversely affect our operating results 
we anticipate that average selling prices for many of our products will decline in the future  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we expect that the price we can charge its customers for many of its products will decline as new technologies become available  as we transition to software based ip and as low cost regional providers take measures to achieve or maintain market share 
if this occurs  our operating results will be adversely affected 
to respond to increasing competition and our anticipation that average selling prices will decrease  we are attempting to reduce manufacturing costs of our new and existing products 
if we do not reduce manufacturing costs and average selling prices decrease  our operating results will be adversely affected 
two of our key us patents expired in march  which could lead to competitors entering the market 
the dialogic brooktrout tdm boards  the dialogic diva tdm boards and the dialogic brooktrout sr software products make use of our patented technology to route a fax to a local area network using a direct inward dial number 
the two patents covering this technology recently expired 
the expiration of a patent typically results in increased competition and a decline in revenue 
if other companies start to manufacture and sell a similar product based on this technology in the united states it could adversely impact our revenues

business combination with dialogic corporation on october   we completed our business combination with dialogic corporation  a british columbia corporation  in accordance with the terms of an acquisition agreement dated may  we acquired all of dialogic corporation s outstanding common and preferred shares in exchange for an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock  after giving effect to the stock split described below and  accordingly dialogic corporation became our wholly owned subsidiary 
all outstanding options to purchase dialogic corporation common shares were cancelled and new options to purchase our common stock were granted 
each option to purchase dialogic corporation common shares became an option to acquire that number of shares of our common stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying the number of shares in the capital of dialogic corporation subject to the option by  rounded down to the nearest whole share of our common stock 
each option to purchase our common shares has a purchase price per share of our common stock equal to the exercise price per share in us dollars for the dialogic corporation option immediately prior to october  divided by  rounded up to the nearest whole cent 
after taking into account the issuance of stock options to purchase our common stock in exchange for dialogic corporation options  as october   the former dialogic corporation shareholders and option holders held approximately and our existing stockholders held approximately of our outstanding securities 
as of october   there were approximately million shares of our common stock issued and outstanding  after taking into account the effect of the one for five reverse stock split approved by the our stockholders on september  and effected on october  as of october   we changed our name from veraz networks  inc to dialogic inc 
and on october   our common stock began trading on the nasdaq global market under the symbol dlgc

all common stock share and per share data presented have been retroactively restated to give effect to the reverse stock split 
also  all common stock and per share data reflects the legal capital of the former veraz networks  inc retroactively adjusted for the exchange ratios in the acquisition agreement to reflect the number of shares received in the business combination 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
table of contents statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
the accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and which required the most subjective judgment by us  are the following revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes  and business combinations revenue recognition we recognize revenue and allocate it to each element of an arrangement based on objective evidence of fair value that is specific to the company 
when an arrangement involves multiple elements  such as hardware and software products  maintenance and or professional services  we allocate the entire sales price to each respective element based on the vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the fair value for each element 
when arrangements contain multiple elements and vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements but not for the delivered elements  we recognize revenue for the delivered elements using the residual method 
we base our determination of vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered elements based on substantive renewal rates of maintenance and support agreements  and on independently sold and negotiated service arrangements 
for arrangements containing multiple elements where vsoe of fair value does not exist for an undelivered element  we defer revenue for the delivered and undelivered elements until vsoe of fair value exists for the undelivered elements or all elements have been delivered 
we recognize maintenance pcs revenue ratably over the maintenance support period 
all of our products may be sold in bundled arrangements that include pcs  installation  training  and other professional services 
we recognize revenue on some arrangements that require evidence of customer acceptance of the hardware and software products that have been sold 
in such cases  delivery of the software  hardware and services is not considered to have occurred until evidence of acceptance is received from the customer or we have completed our contractual requirements 
revenue received from maintenance contracts is presented as deferred revenue and is recognized into revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
license fee revenue is recognized upon delivery of the licenses software and when all performance criteria are met 
revenue derived from the sale of products is generally recognized when title and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer 
in addition  product  maintenance contract and license fee revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  amounts are fixed or can be determined  and ability to collect is probable 
in certain cases where the sales price cannot be reliably determined due to frequent sales price reductions  sales made to distributors under agreements allowing price protection and or the right of return are deferred from revenue until the distributors ship the products  upon which we recognize revenue 
sales incentives are recorded as a reduction of revenue as there are no identifiable benefits received 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances as a reduction from sales in the same period during which the related revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns and allowances  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
we also have agreements with distributors which allow for stock rotation rights 
the stock rotation rights permit the distributors to return a defined percentage of their purchases in exchange for orders of an equal or greater amount 
we recognize an allowance for stock rotation rights based on historical experience and period end inventory levels at the distributors 
the provision is recorded as a reduction in revenues in the statement of operations 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is probable 
the primary estimates and assumptions in our revenue recognition polices are as follows sales returns and related reserves we assess these estimates based on historical sales returns and allowances  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 

table of contents vsoe of fair value for engineering services we limit our assessment of vsoe of fair value to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue is recognized upon delivery of the hardware and software using the residual method 
we are not likely to materially change our pricing practices in the future 
vsoe for pcs vsoe is determined based upon the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
vsoe for pcs in certain ip solutions products are based on the premise that the stated renewal rates in the contractual arrangements will be enforced when the customer renews their pcs after the initial term 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts generally  our receivables are recorded when billed and represent claims against third parties that will be settled in cash 
the carrying value of the receivables  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts  represents their estimated net realizable value 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses inherent in our accounts receivable portfolio 
in establishing the required allowance  management considers historical losses  current receivable aging and evaluates individual customer receivables by considering our knowledge of a customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
we write off trade receivables when they are deemed uncollectible 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts regularly 
however  judgment is required to determine whether an increase or reversal of the allowance is warranted 
we will record an increase of the allowance if there is a deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than we had anticipated  or for customer specific circumstances  such as bankruptcy 
we will record a reversal of the allowance if there is significant improvement in collection rates 
historically  the allowance has been adequate to cover the actual losses from uncollectible accounts 
inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the first in  first out method 
in assessing the net realizable value of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with the current or committed inventory levels 
once our inventory has been written down to its estimated net realizable value  our carrying value cannot be increased due to subsequent changes in demand forecasts 
to the extent that a severe decline in forecasted demand occurs  or we experience a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we may incur significant charges for excess inventory 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized and are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
the impairment test compares the carrying amount of the intangible asset with its fair value  and an impairment loss is recognized for the excess  if any 
the impairment testing is performed during the last quarter of the fiscal year 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business acquisition 
goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates to its carrying value 
to the extent the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  we measure the amount of impairment by the excess of carrying value over the implied fair value of goodwill 
the impairment is charged to income in the period in which it is determined 
the impairment testing is performed during the last quarter of the fiscal year 
considerable judgment is required to estimate discounted future operating cash flows 
judgment is also required in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the value of intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill 
factors that could indicate an impairment may exist include significant underperformance relative to plan or long term projections  strategic changes in business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends and a significant change in circumstances relative to a large 
table of contents customer 
we must make assumptions about future cash flows  future operating plans  discount rates and other factors in the models and valuation reports 
to the extent these future projections and estimates change  the estimated amounts of impairment could differ from current estimates 
our annual testing for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for and indicated that no impairment of goodwill or the intangibles existed 
stock based compensation we use generally accepted valuation option pricing models to determine the fair value of stock options granted to our employees 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  which represents our best estimate 
the following are the key assumptions used to determine the stock based compensation expense expected stock price volatility the computation of expected volatility is based on the historical and implied volatility of comparable companies from a representative peer group based on such factors as industry and market capitalization data 
expected term of option the expected term was determined using the simplified method 
expected dividend yield the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
we use a dividend yield of zero  as we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay dividends in the future 
expected risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
forfeiture rate the forfeiture rate is based on a review of recent forfeiture activity 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach  which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are based on provisions of the enacted tax law 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be more likely than not realized 
as a result of recent cumulative losses and uncertainty regarding future taxable income  we have determined based on all available evidence  that there was substantial uncertainty as to the realizability of recorded net deferred tax assets in future periods 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance for of our deferred tax assets 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes using a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
an uncertain tax position is considered effectively settled on completion of an examination by a taxing authority if certain other conditions are satisfied 
business combinations amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values at the date of acquisition 
fair value was determined using the income approach discounted cash flow approach valuation methodology 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to the identifiable intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable and that of a market participant 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
the separately identifiable intangible assets generally include technology and customer relationships 
we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue related to product support assumed in connection with acquisitions 
the estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin 
the estimated costs to fulfill the support contracts are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support 
we then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill

there can be no assurances that alternative financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
this could harm us by increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions in our industry or the economy in general  requiring substantial amounts of cash to be used for debt servicing  rather than other purposes  including operations  limiting our ability to plan for  or react to  changes in our business and industry  and influencing investor and customer perceptions about our financial stability and limiting our ability to obtain financing or acquire customers

in order for us to meet the long term debt repayment requirements  we may need to raise additional capital by refinancing our debt  raising equity capital or selling assets 
uncertainty in future credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access debt financing

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk a significant portion of our cash flows and financial assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars  which is our functional and reporting currency 
the majority of our revenues and most of our costs of sales  including subcontractor manufacturing expenses  are also denominated in us dollars 
however  we maintain sales and business operations in foreign countries and part of our operating expenses are incurred in these foreign countries 
as such  we have exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with operating expenses  including personnel  facilities and other expenses  of our foreign operations 
foreign currency risk is limited to the portion of our business transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars  and relates primarily to expenses in our canadian  brazilian and european operations 
our foreign currency transactions and fluctuations in the respective exchange rates relative to the us dollar will create volatility in our cash flows and the reported amounts for selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
we have not historically used forward contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange risk on our operations 
although we have not used these instruments in the past  we have the ability under the terms of the revolving credit agreement to enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the revolving credit lender to protect against foreign exchange risks 
if the exchange rates between the us dollar and the great britain pound  canadian dollar  brazilian reals and the euros had increased or decreased by in  the foreign exchange gain or loss would have increased or decreased by approximately million in due to the impact of actual changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and these other currencies  we recorded foreign exchange losses of million in credit risk credit risk results from the possibility that a loss may occur from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of the contract 
our financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
cash is placed with major financial institutions 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is mitigated by our credit evaluation process  credit insurance on certain receivables and the dispersion of our customers among different geographical locations around the world 
as of december   accounts receivable aggregating approximately million were insured for credit risk  which are amounts that represent total insured accounts receivable less an average co insurance amount of  subject to the terms of the insurance agreement 
under the terms of the insurance agreement  we are required to pay a premium equal to of consolidated sales for interest rate risk we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million at december  our current monetary assets are not exposed to significant interest rate risk due to their relatively short term nature 
excess cash is invested with financial institutions and generally bears interest at fixed rates 
changes in interest rates on cash balances held with those financial institutions would not have a significant effect on our consolidated statement of operations 
we also had long term debt aggregating million under our term loan agreement and shareholder loans  and bank indebtedness of million as of december  the bank indebtedness and the term loan agreement bears interest at floating rates  generally tied to libor 
accordingly  we are exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that our debt is at a variable rate of interest 
we did not have any open derivative contracts relating to floating rate debt as of december  or an increase or decrease in the interest rate by would have increased or decreased interest expense by million in
