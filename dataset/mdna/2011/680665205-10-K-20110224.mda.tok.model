other as part of the continuing environmental investigation by federal  state  and local governments of waste disposal sites  we have entered into a number of settlement agreements requiring us to participate in the investigation and cleanup of a number of sites 
under the terms of such settlements and related agreements  we may be required to manage or perform one or more elements of a site cleanup  or to manage the entire remediation activity for a number of parties  and subsequently seek recovery of some or all of such costs from other potentially responsible parties prps 
in many cases  we do not know the ultimate costs of our settlement obligations at the time of entering into particular settlement agreements  and our liability accruals for our obligations under those agreements are often subject to significant man agement judgment on an ongoing basis 
those cost accruals are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and our accounting policies set forth in the environmental matters section in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business background our manufacturing operations are concentrated in two business segments chlor alkali products and winchester 
both are capital intensive manufacturing businesses with operating rates closely tied to the general economy 
each segment has a commodity element to it  and therefore  our ability to influence pricing is quite limited on the portion of the segment s business that is strictly commodity 
our chlor alkali products business is a commodity business where all supplier products are similar and price is the major supplier selection criterion 
we have little or no ability to influence prices in this large  global commodity market 
cyclical price swings  driven by changes in supply demand  can be abrupt and significant and  given capacity in our chlor alkali products business  can lead to very significant changes in our overall profitability 
winchester also has a commodity element to its business  but a majority of winchester ammunition is sold as a branded consumer product where there are opportunities to differentiate certain offerings through innovative new product development and enhanced product performance 
while competitive pricing versus other branded ammunition products is important  it is not the only factor in product selection 
recent developments and highlights year in  chlor alkali products segment income was million  a decrease of compared with the prior year 
chlor alkali products began to experience improved chlorine and caustic soda demand during and experienced a record level of bleach sales 
volumes for chlorine and caustic soda improved compared to  while volumes for bleach improved 
operating rates in chlor alkali products for and were and  respectively 
our ecu netbacks of were lower than the netbacks of  however  the pricing trend has been positive throughout as ecu netbacks increased sequentially from the low level of in the third quarter of the fourth quarter of ecu netback was as business conditions improved throughout  our quarterly chlor alkali operating rates improved year over year by at least peaking in the third quarter of with a operating rate during the summer demand season 
a significant portion of the north american chlor alkali demand improvement came from exports of products made from chlorine  driven by the energy advantage north america enjoys by using natural gas as compared to crude oil 
with demand for both chlorine and caustic soda improving  price increases were announced throughout the year 
during february  an per ton caustic soda price increase was announced 
we began realizing a portion of this price increase in caustic soda in the second quarter of caustic soda demand continued to improve  and as a result  during the third quarter of  three additional caustic soda price increases were announced totaling per ton 
we believe that a portion of the per ton caustic soda price increases announced during the third quarter of will be realized 
we anticipate some additional benefits from these price increases and from contracts that re set on an annual basis to be realized in the first half of additionally  we announced a per ton caustic soda price increase in january while the success of this per ton caustic soda price increase is not yet known  some portion of the benefits of this price increase  if realiz ed  would impact our system beginning in the second quarter of winchester segment income of million in  which represented the second highest level of segment income in at least the last two decades  declined compared to the prior year segment income of million 
the higher than normal levels of commercial demand that began in the fourth quarter of continued through the second quarter of beginning with the third quarter of  winchester began to experience a decline in commercial demand from the levels 
however  the second half of commercial demand remained stronger than levels 
commercial volumes  excluding rimfire  for decreased approximately from prior year levels 
on december   our board of directors approved a plan to convert the  tons of mercury cell capacity at our charleston  tn facility to  tons of membrane capacity capable of producing both potassium hydroxide and caustic soda 
the project has an estimated capital cost of approximately million 
the board of directors also approved a plan to reconfigure our augusta  ga facility to manufacture bleach and distribute caustic soda  while discontinuing chlor alkali manufacturing at this site 
this action will reduce our chlor alkali manufacturing capacity by  tons 
we based our decision on several factors 
first  over the past eighteen months we have experienced a steady increase in the number of customers unwilling to accept our products manufactured using mercury cell technology 
 second  there is federal legislation that was passed in governing the treatment of mercury that significantly limits our recycling options after december  we concluded that exiting mercury cell technology production after represented an unacceptable future cost risk 
further  the conversion of the charleston  tn plant to membrane technology will reduce the electricity usage per ecu produced by approximately and the configuration of the new plant will result in an increase in our capacity to produce potassium hydroxide 
the decision to reconfigure the augusta  ga facility to manufacture bleach and distribute caustic soda removes the highest cost production capacity from our system 
we currently expect to complete these conversions by the end of on november   we announced that we had made the decision to relocate winchester centerfire ammunition operations from east alton  il to oxford  ms 
this relocation  when completed  is forecast to reduce winchester s annual operating costs by approximately million 
consistent with this relocation decision we have initiated an estimated million five year project  which includes approximately million of capital spending 
the state of mississippi and local governments have provided incentives which should offset approximately percent of the capital spending 
once completed  winchester expects to have the most modern centerfire ammunition production facility in north america 
our total restructuring charge for related to these actions was million 
the restructuring charge included write off of equipment and facility costs of million  acceleration of asset retirement obligations of million  employee severance and related benefit costs of million  a non cash pension and other postretirement benefits curtailment charge of million  and lease and other contract termination costs of million 
we expect to incur additional charges related to the implementation of plans to exit the use of mercury cell technology in the chlor alkali manufacturing process and the transfer of the winchester centerfire ammunition operations over the next several years  however  at this time  we are not able to estimate the extent of any additional expenses that may be incurred in connection with these actions 
income before taxes for included million of recoveries from third parties for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods 
for  income before taxes also included million of recoveries from third parties for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods 
income tax expense for included million of favorable adjustments associated with the expiration of statutes of limitation in domestic and foreign jurisdictions and a reduction in expense related to the release of a valuation allowance recorded against the foreign tax credit carryforward deferred tax asset generated by our canadian operations 
income tax expense for included million of favorable adjustments associated with the expiration of statutes of limitation in domestic and foreign jurisdictions and reductions in expense associated with the finalization of the income tax returns 
in september  we redeemed industrial development and environmental improvement tax exempt bonds industrial revenue bonds totaling million  with maturity dates of february and march we paid a premium of million to the bond holders  which was included in interest expense 
we also recognized a million deferred gain in interest expense related to the interest rate swaps  which were terminated in april  on these industrial revenue bonds 
in october  we redeemed additional industrial revenue bonds totaling million  with a maturity date of october in october  we completed a financing of go zone and recovery zone tax exempt bonds totaling million due we have the option to borrow up to the entire million in a series of draw downs through december  during  we drew million of these bonds 
the proceeds from these bonds are required to be used to fund capital project spending at our mcintosh  al facility 
in december  we completed a financing of recovery zone tax exempt bonds totaling million due in and during  we drew the entire million of the bonds 
the proceeds from the bonds are required to be used to fund the charleston  tn facility mercury cell conversion and our oxford  ms winchester relocation 
of the million drawn from the go zone and recovery zone bonds  million of the associated cash was classified as a noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash  until such time as we request reimbursement of qualifying amounts used to fund the capital projects in alabama  mississippi and tennessee 
the patient protection and affordable healthcare act was signed into law on march  and the healthcare and education reconciliation act of was signed into law on march  collectively the healthcare acts 
the impact of the healthcare acts did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
year in  chlor alkali products segment income was million  a decline of compared with chlor alkali products continued to experience the weak product demand that began in the fourth quarter of volumes for chlorine and caustic soda decreased compared to volumes for bleach  which accounted for approximately of chlor alkali products sales  increased compared to operating rates in chlor alkali products for and were and  respectively 
these operating rates assume that of our demonstrated capacity was available for use 
the capacity of our st 
gabriel  la facility had been shutdown since late november and the facility was not available for use until the conversion and expansion project was co mpleted in the fourth quarter of in addition  in response to low levels of customer demand for chlorine and caustic soda  an additional of our chlorine and caustic soda capacity was idled by us in after taking these capacity reduction actions into consideration  our effective operating rate for was 
our ecu netbacks of were lower than the netbacks of  reflecting the changes in the pricing dynamics in north america 
during  north american demand for caustic soda was strong  while supply continued to be constrained by the weakness in chlorine demand 
this resulted in a significant supply and demand imbalance for caustic soda in north america  which resulted in record caustic soda pricing 
the result was a record ecu netback  in our system  in the first quarter of of approximately beginning late in the fourth quarter of and continuing through  demand for caustic soda weakened significantly  and fell below the demand for chlorine 
this created excess supply in north america  which caused caustic soda prices to fall 
the ov er supply of caustic soda caused industry operating rates to be constrained  which resulted in chlorine price increase announcements of per ton during the second quarter of caustic soda prices declined precipitously in the second quarter of and these declines continued into the third quarter of during the third quarter of  chlorine and caustic soda demand became more balanced eliminating the oversupply of caustic soda 
we began realizing increases in chlorine prices in the third quarter of with most of the improvement in the fourth quarter of ecu netbacks  in our system  bottomed out in the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  as caustic soda demand improved  chlorine production declined due to seasonally weaker demand 
this resulted in a supply and demand imbalance for caustic soda in north america 
as a result of this imbalance  in december  a per ton caustic soda price increase was announced 
we began realizing the benefits of this price increase in caustic soda in the first half of winchester segment income of million in  which represented the highest level of segment income in at least the last two decades  improved compared to segment income of million 
winchester continued to experience the above normal levels of demand during that began around the november presidential election 
the increase in demand was across the majority of winchester s product offerings  including rifle  pistol and rimfire ammunition 
on a volume basis  winchester s unit shipments increased in compared to  which was driven by the higher level of commercial sales 
winchester s results reflected the impact of increased volumes and higher selling prices  and lower commodity and other material costs 
income from continuing operations before taxes for included million of recoveries from third parties for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods 
on august   we sold million of senior notes notes with a maturity date of august  the notes were issued at of par value  providing a yield to maturity to investors of 
interest is paid semi annually in arrears on each february and august proceeds of million  after expenses of million  from the notes were used to further strengthen our long term liquidity 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed a conversion and expansion project at our st 
gabriel  la facility and initiated production 
this project increased capacity at this location from  ecus to  ecus and significantly reduced the site s manufacturing costs 
our capital spending included million and million for the st 
gabriel  la facility conversion and expansion project in and  respectively 
during the second and third quarters of  bills were introduced in the united states house of representatives and the senate  respectively  which  if enacted  would ban the production of chlor alkali products using mercury cell technology two years from the date it is enacted into law 
on october   the house of representatives committee on energy and commerce passed a bill that would require chlor alkali producers using mercury cell technology to make a decision by june  as to whether to shutdown or convert these facilities 
if the decision was to convert  the mercury cell plants would have been required to be converted by june  if the decision was not to convert  the plants would have been required to be shutdown by june  for this bill to become law it wou ld have had to be passed by the full house of representatives and the full senate 
the proposed legislation expired without enactment at the end of and we are uncertain as to whether or not similar legislation may be proposed in the future 
we currently operate two facilities which utilize mercury cell technology totaling approximately  ecus of capacity approximately of our capacity 
we operate our mercury cell facilities in full compliance with all environmental rules and regulations 
on december   our board of directors approved a plan to convert the  tons of mercury cell capacity at our charleston  tn facility to  tons of membrane capacity capable of producing both potassium hydroxide and caustic soda 
the board of directors also approved a plan to reconfigure our augusta  ga facility to manufacture bleach and distribute caustic soda  while discontinuing chlor alkali manufacturing at this site 
we curr ently expect to complete these conversions by the end of year in  chlor alkali products had record segment income of million  an improvement of compared with this improvement reflects the combination of the full year contributions from the pioneer acquisition of million  including synergies  and improved pricing of million 
these were partially offset by the effect from lower chlorine and caustic soda volumes of million 
operating rates in our chlor alkali products business were for  which were negatively impacted during the fourth quarter of by lower levels of demand from all major customer groups  and by hurricane related outages at our st 
gabriel  la facility and our sunbelt joint venture during the third quarter of in response to the low level of demand during the fourth quarter of  we announced that the st 
gabriel  la facility  which was shutdown for scheduled maintenance in late november  would not resume operations until the conversion and expansion project was completed 
the project was completed in the fourth quarter of the st 
gabriel  la facility represents approximately of our chlorine and caustic soda capacity 
during the first three quarters of  north american demand for caustic soda was strong 
in addition  caustic soda supply was constrained by the weakness in chlorine demand  which caused operating rates to be reduced 
this created an imbalance between caustic soda supply and demand 
this imbalance  combined with increased freight and energy costs  resulted in our achieving record levels of caustic soda pricing 
during the fourth quarter of  north american caustic soda demand weakened but less than the decline in chlorine demand 
this caused the caustic soda supply and demand imbalance to continue  which continued to support record levels of caustic soda prices 
on march   we announced that  in connection with our plans to streamline chlor alkali products manufacturing operations in canada in order to serve our customer base in a more cost effective manner  we would close the acquired dalhousie  new brunswick  canada chlorine  caustic soda  sodium chlorate  and bleach operations 
we substantially completed the closure of the dalhousie facility by june  we expect to incur cash expenditures of million associated with the shutdown  which were previously included in current liabilities on the pioneer acquisition balance sheet 
we have paid million of costs associated with this shutdown as of december  this action generated million to million of annual pretax savings 
winchester segment income was million in  which represented the highest level of segment income in at least the last two decades at that time for the winchester business  an increase of compared with winchester s results for reflected the combination of improved pricing and increased law enforcement volumes which more than offset higher commodity  material and manufacturing costs 
in  other income expense included an impairment charge of the full value of a million investment in corporate debt securities 
on october   the issuer of these debt securities announced it would cease trading and appoint a receiver as a result of financial market turmoil 
the decline in the market value of the assets supporting these debt securities negatively impacted the liquidity of the issuer 
during the third quarter of  we determined that these debt securities had no fair market value due to the actions taken by the issuer  turmoil in the financial markets  the lack of liquidity of the issuer  and the lack of trading in these debt securities 
we are currently unable to utilize the capital loss resulting from the impairment of these corporate debt securities  there fore  no tax benefit has been recognized for the impairment loss 
in  the domestic defined benefit pension plan s investment portfolio declined by approximately 
the decline reflected the weakness in the domestic and international equity markets and increases in interest rate spreads  which reduced the value of certain corporate fixed income investments 
the pension plan s investment performance reflects the actions taken in to reduce the defined benefit pension plan s exposure to equity investments and increase its exposure to fixed income investments 
during the same period  interest rates on corporate bonds  used to determine the defined benefit pension plan s liability discount rate  fluctuated dramatically during the year but ended comparable with the levels at december   which resulted in no change to the discount rate for we recorded an after tax charge of million million pretax to shareholders equity as of december  for our pension and other postretirement plans  which reduced the over funded position in our pension plan that existed at december  this charge reflected the unfavorable performance on pension plan assets and the unchanged discount rate during chlor alkali products pricing in accordance with industry practice  we calculate chlor alkali products prices on an ecu netback basis  reporting and analyzing prices net of the cost of transporting the products to customers to allow for a comparable means of price comparisons between periods and with respect to our competitors 
for purposes of determining our ecu netback  we use prices that we realize as a result of sales of chlorine and caustic soda to our customers  and we do not include the value of chlorine and caustic soda that is incorporated in other products that we manufacture and sell 
quarterly and annual average ecu netbacks  excluding sunbelt  for   and were as follows first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter annual average during the first three quarters of  north american demand for caustic soda was strong 
however  caustic soda supply continued to be constrained by the weakness in chlorine demand  which caused operating rates to be reduced 
this resulted in a significant supply and demand imbalance for caustic soda in north america 
this imbalance  combined with increased freight and energy costs  resulted in our achieving record levels of caustic soda pricing 
during the fourth quarter of  north american caustic soda demand weakened but less than the decline in chlorine demand

among the stated objectives of the laws are the protection of both pension beneficiaries and the financial health of the pbgc 
to accomplish these objectives  the new laws require sponsors to fund defined benefit pension plans earlier than previous requirements and to pay increased pbgc premiums 
the laws require defined benefit pension plans to be fully funded for based on our plan assumptions and estimates  we will not be required to make any cash contributions to the domestic defined benefit pension plan at least through we do have a small canadian defined benefit pens ion plan to which we made million and million of cash contributions in and  respectively  and we anticipate less than million of cash contributions in at december   the market value of assets in our defined benefit pension plans of  million exceeded the projected benefit obligation by million

sales of ammunition to domestic commercial customers decreased million 
beginning with the third quarter of  winchester began to experience a decline in commercial demand from the levels 
however  the second half of commercial demand remained stronger than the levels 
these decreases in domestic commercial sales were partially offset by higher shipments to military customers of million  higher shipments to international customers of million and increased shipments to industrial customers  who primarily supply the construction sector  of million 
shipments to law enforcement agencies also increased million 
winchester reported segment income of million for compared to million for  a decrease of million  or

winchester continued to experience the above normal levels of demand in that began around the november presidential election 
the increase in demand was across the majority of winchester s product offerings  including rifle  pistol and rimfire ammunition 
shipments to military customers also increased million 
these increases were partially offset by lower shipments to industrial customers  who primarily supply the construction sector  of million and decreased shipments to law enforcement agencies of million 
on a volume basis  winchester s overall unit shipments increased  which was driven by the higher level of commercial sales 
winchester reported segment income of million for compared to million for  an increase of million  or

outlook net income in the first quarter of is projected to be in the to per diluted share range compared with per diluted share in the first quarter of in chlor alkali products  the first quarter of segment earnings are expected to improve compared to both the fourth quarter of earnings of million and the first quarter of earnings of million 
the improved segment earnings anticipate higher ecu netbacks and chlorine and caustic soda shipment volumes 
the chlor alkali products operating rate in the first quarter of is forecast to be in the range  which is comparable to the fourth quarter of level of and an improvement from the first quarter of level of 
the fourth quarter of ecu netback was business conditions improved throughout  and olin s quarterly chlor alkali operating rates improved year over year by at least peaking in the third quarter of with a operating rate during the summer demand season 
a significant portion of the north american chlor alkali demand improvement came from exports of products made from chlorine  driven by the energy advantage north america enjoys by using natural gas as compared to crude oil 
with demand for both chlorine and caustic soda improving  price increases were announced throughout the year 
during the third quarter of  three caustic soda price increases were announced totaling per ton 
we believe that a portion of the per ton caustic soda price increases announced during the third quarter of will be realized 
we anticipate some additional benefits from these price increases and from contracts that re set on an annual basis to be realized in the first half of additionally  we announced a per ton caustic soda price increase in january while the success of this per ton caustic soda price increase is not yet known  some portion of the benefits of this price increase  if realized  would impact our system beginning in the second quarter of bleach volumes in increased approximately compared to levels as we began to see the benefits of our initiatives to ship bleach by rail 
we have now experienced nine consecutive quarters  on a year over year basis  of volume growth in bleach shipments at a rate in excess of 
we are currently forecasting an additional to growth in bleach shipments in compared to during  approximately of our effective chlor alkali capacity was consumed making bleach 
the continuation of these initiatives and the start up of our first low salt  high strength bleach facility in mcintosh  al  which is expected during the third quarter of  will drive future growth 
winchester first quarter segment earnings are expected to be higher than the fourth quarter of segment earnings of million but lower than the first quarter of segment earnings of million 
higher commodity costs and lower levels of commercial demand than the prior year first quarter are expected to negatively impact first quarter of segment earnings 
the higher than normal levels of commercial demand that began in the fourth quarter of continued through the second quarter of however  beginning with the third quarter of  winchester began to experience a decline in commercial demand from the levels 
winchester s fourth quarter acquired cost of all commodity metals increased compared to fourth quarter levels 
the price of copper increased  the price of lead and the price of zinc increased 
winchester utilizes approximately three times as much lead as copper and three times as much copper as zinc 
as we look forward into  the price of copper will likely present a significant challenge 
during the second half of  there has been a steady rise in the average monthly price of copper from per pound in june to per pound in december  with daily spot prices in december approaching per pound 
during january  copper prices have continued at the recent elevated levels and averaged per pound 
on november   we announced that we had made the decision to relocate winchester centerfire ammunition operations from east alton  il to oxford  ms 
this relocation  when completed  is forecast to reduce winchester s annual operating costs by approximately million 
we also expect this relocation project to reduce winchester s segment earnings before meaningful savings are realized beginning in the reduction to winchester segment income for this relocation project is estimated to be million to million 
without the recoveries of environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods  we anticipate that charges for environmental investigatory and remedial activities will be in the million range  which is comparable with the average environmental cost for the last years  and higher than the level of million 
we do believe that there are additional opportunities to recover environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods  but the timing and the amount of any additional recoveries are uncertain 
we expect defined benefit pension plan income in to be similar to the level 
based on the december  funding status  we will not be required to make any cash contributions to our domestic defined benefit pension plan in we do have a small canadian defined benefit pension plan to which we made million and million of cash contributions in and  respectively  and we anticipate cash contributions of less than million in we believe the effective tax rate will be in the to range 
in  we expect capital spending to be in the million to million range  which includes spending for the conversion of our charleston  tn facility from mercury cell technology to membrane technology and the relocation of our winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations 
the capital spending for the winchester relocation will be partially financed by approximately million of grants provided by the state of mississippi and local governments 
also  we expect to continue capital spending for the low salt  high strength bleach facility located at our mcintosh  al site  which is expected to be completed in we expect depreciation expense to be approximately million 
environmental matters years ended december  cash outlays receipts in millions remedial and investigatory spending charged to reserve recoveries from third parties capital spending plant operations charged to cost of goods sold total cash outlays receipts our liabilities for future environmental expenditures were as follows december  in millions beginning balance charges to income remedial and investigatory spending pioneer acquired liabilities currency translation adjustments ending balance total environmental related cash outlays in increased compared to due to the lower recoveries from third parties of costs incurred and expensed in prior periods 
remedial and investigatory spending was lower in than due to completing a remedial action at a site in and principally completing an investigation at a former manufacturing site in remedial and investigatory spending was lower in than due to reduced spending at two former pioneer sites and principally completing an investigation at a former manufacturing site in partially offset by spending in to complete remedial action at a site 
total environmental related cash outlays for are estimated to be approximately million  of which million is expected to be spent on investigatory and reme dial efforts  million on capital projects and million on normal plant operations 
remedial and investigatory spending is anticipated to be higher in than due to the implementation of remedial actions at two former manufacturing sites and one former waste disposal site 
historically  we have funded our environmental capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and expect to do so in the future 
cash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations were not charged to income but instead were charged to reserves established for such costs identified and expensed to income in prior years 
cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income 
in the united states  the establishment and implementation of federal  state  and local standards to regulate air  water and land quality affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations 
federal legislation providing for regulation of the manufacture  transportation  use  and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances  and remediation of contaminated sites  has imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry  particularly the chemicals industry 
in addition  implementation of environmental laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act and the clean air act  has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase plant operating costs 
our canadian facility is governed by federal environmental laws administered by environment canada and by provincial e nvironmental laws enforced by administrative agencies 
many of these laws are comparable to the us laws described above 
we employ waste minimization and pollution prevention programs at our manufacturing sites 
we are party to various governmental and private environmental actions associated with past manufacturing facilities and former waste disposal sites 
associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs 
our ability to estimate future costs depends on whether our investigatory and remedial activities are in preliminary or advanced stages 
with respect to unasserted claims  we accrue liabilities for costs that  in our experience  we may incur to protect our interests against those unasserted claims 
our accrued liabilities for unasserted claims amounted to million at december  with respect to asserted claims  we accru e liabilities based on remedial investigation  feasibility study  remedial action and operation  maintenance and monitoring om m expenses that  in our experience  we may incur in connection with the asserted claims 
required site om m expenses are estimated and accrued in their entirety for required periods not exceeding years  which reasonably approximates the typical duration of long term site om m 
charges or credits to income for investigatory and remedial efforts were material to operating results in  and and may be material to operating results in future years 
environmental provisions charged credited to income  which are included in cost of goods sold  were as follows years ended december  in millions charges to income recoveries from third parties of costs incurred and expensed in prior periods total environmental expense income these charges relate primarily to remedial and investigatory activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites 
our total estimated environmental liability at the end of  was attributable to sites  of which were usepa national priority list npl sites 
ten sites accounted for of our environmental liability and  of the remaining sites  no one site accounted for more than of our environmental liability 
at one of these ten sites  a remedial action plan is being implemented 
at five of the ten sites  part of the site is subject to a remedial investigation and another part is in the long term om m stage 
at one of these ten sites  a remedial investigation is being performed 
at one site  part of the site is subject to a remedial action plan and part of the site to long term om m 
the two remaining sites are in long term om m 
all ten sites ar e either associated with past manufacturing operations or former waste disposal sites 
none of the ten largest sites represents more than of the liabilities reserved on our consolidated balance sheet at december  for future environmental expenditures 
our consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to million at december   and million at december   of which million and million  respectively  were classified as other noncurrent liabilities 
our environmental liability amounts did not take into account any discounting of future expenditures or any consideration of insurance recoveries or advances in technology 
these liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed and or remediation efforts and our estimate of related costs have changed 
as a result of these reassessments  future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities 
of the million i ncluded on our consolidated balance sheet at december  for future environmental expenditures  we currently expect to utilize million of the reserve for future environmental expenditures over the next years  million for expenditures to years in the future  and million for expenditures beyond years in the future 
these estimates are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  as described in item a risk factors environmental costs 
annual environmental related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation  capital projects  and normal plant operations are expected to range between million to million over the next several years  million to million of which is for investigatory and remedial efforts  which are expected to be charged against reserves recorded on our balance sheet 
while we do not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of our environmental related cash outlays  there is always the possibility that such an increase may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  changes in regulatory authorities  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other prps  and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably to us  which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
at december   we estimate it is reasonably possible that we may have additional contingent environmental liabilities of million in addition to the amounts for which we have already recorded as a reserve 
legal matters and contingencies we  and our subsidiaries  are defendants in various legal actions including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos incidental to our past and current business activities 
we describe some of these matters in item legal proceedings 
at december  and  our consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for these legal actions of million and million  respectively 
these liabilities do not include costs associated with legal representation 
based on our analysis  and considering the inherent uncertainties associated with litigation  we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that these legal actions will materially adversely affect our financial statements or results of operations in the near term 
during the ordinary course of our business  contingencies arise resulting from an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving an uncertainty as to the realization of a possible gain contingency 
in certain instances such as environmental projects  we are responsible for managing the cleanup and remediation of an environmental site 
there exists the possibility of recovering a portion of these costs from other parties 
we account for gain contingencies in accordance with the provisions of asc contingencies asc  formerly sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  sfas no 
 and therefore do not record gain contingencies and recognize income until it is earned and realizable

liquidity and other financing arrangements our principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  cash flow from operations  and short term borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility 
additionally  we believe that we have access to the debt and equity markets 
cash flow from operations is variable as a result of both the seasonal and the cyclical nature of our operating results  which have been affected by seasonal and economic cycles in many of the industries we serve  such as the vinyls  urethanes  bleach  ammunition and pulp and paper 
the seasonality of the ammunition business  which is typically driven by the fall hunting season  and the seasonality of the vinyls and bleach businesses  which are stronger in periods of warmer weather  typically cause working capital to fluctuate between million to million over the course of the year 
cash flow from operations is affected by changes in ecu selling prices caused by the changes in the supply demand balance of chlorine and caustic soda  resulting in the chlor alkali business having significant leverage on our ear nings and cash flow 
for example  assuming all other costs remain constant and internal consumption remains approximately the same  a per ecu selling price change equates to an approximate million annual change in our revenues and pretax profit when we are operating at full capacity

additionally  we believe that we have access to the debt and equity markets 
since  we held corporate debt securities with a par value of million 
on october   the issuer of these debt securities announced it would cease trading and appoint a receiver as a result of financial market turmoil 
the decline in the market value of the assets supporting these debt securities negatively impacted the liquidity of the issuer 
we determined that these debt securities had no fair market value due to the actions taken by the issuer  turmoil in the financial markets  the lack of liquidity of the issuer  and the lack of trading in these debt securities 
because of the unlikelihood that these debt securities would recover in value  we recorded an after tax impairment loss of million in other income expense in the third quarter of we are curre ntly unable to utilize the capital loss resulting from the impairment of these corporate debt securities  therefore  no tax benefit has been recognized for the impairment loss 
in october  we recovered million from the investment in these corporate debt securities  which was recorded as a gain in other income expense

in september  we redeemed industrial revenue bonds totaling million  with maturity dates of february and march we paid a premium of million to the bond holders  which was included in interest expense 
we also recognized a million deferred gain in interest expense related to the interest rate swaps  which were terminated in april  on these industrial revenue bonds 
in october  we redeemed additional industrial revenue bonds totaling million  with a maturity date of october in august  we sold million of notes with a maturity date of august  the notes were issued at of par value  providing a yield to maturity to investors of 
interest is paid semi annually in arrears on each february and august proceeds of million  after expenses of million  from the notes were used to further strengthen our long term liquidity 
at december   we had million available under our million senior revolving credit facility  because we had issued million of letters of credit under a million subfacility 
the senior revolving credit facility will expire in october we have the option to expand the million senior revolving credit facility by an additional million through adding a maximum of two additional lending institutions each year 
under the senior revolving credit facility  we may select various floating rate borrowing options 
the actual interest rate paid on borrowings under the senior revolving credit facility is based on a pricing grid which is dependent upon the leverage ratio as calculated under the terms of the facility at the end of the prior fiscal quarter 
th e facility includes various customary restrictive covenants  including restrictions related to the ratio of debt to earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization leverage ratio and the ratio of earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest expense coverage ratio 
compliance with these covenants is determined quarterly based on the operating cash flows for the last four quarters 
we were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions under all our outstanding credit agreements as of december  and  and no event of default had occurred that would permit the lenders under our outstanding credit agreements to accelerate the debt if not cured 
in the future  our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flows  among other factors  will determine the amounts available to be borrowed under these facilities 
as of december   there were no covenants or other restrictions that limite d our ability to borrow 
at december   we had total letters of credit of million outstanding  of which million were issued under our million senior revolving credit facility 
in addition to our senior revolving credit facility  we have a million letter of credit facility  which we reduced from million during the letters of credit were used to support certain long term debt and certain workers compensation insurance policies 
we had a million  day accounts receivable securitization facility accounts receivable facility  renewable annually for five years  which would have expired in july during the second quarter of  we terminated the accounts receivable facility 
based on the liquidity from cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  and borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility  the accounts receivable facility was no longer necessary 
there had been no borrowings under the accounts receivable facility since the accounts receivable facility provided for the sale of our eligible trade receivables to a third party conduit through a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  special purpose entity that was consolidated for financial statement purposes 
the accounts rec eivable facility contained specific covenants relating to the ability of the lender to obtain or maintain a first priority lien on the receivables 
in addition  the accounts receivable facility incorporated the leverage and coverage covenants that are contained in the senior revolving credit facility 
our current debt structure is used to fund our business operations 
as of december   we had long term borrowings  including the current installment  of million of which million was at variable rates 
annual maturities of long term debt are million in  zero in  million in  zero in and and a total of million thereafter 
in december  we have million  including million of unrecognized gains related to interest rate swaps  of bonds that were issued in that will mature 
it is currently our intention to redeem these bonds using our cash 
commitments from banks under our senior revolving credit facility and the additional million not drawn from the go zone bonds issued in are additional sources of liquidity 
we have entered into interest rate swaps on million of our underlying fixed rate debt obligations  whereby we agreed to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
in april  citibank  na terminated million of interest rate swaps on our industrial revenue bonds due in the result was a gain of million  which would have been recognized through in september  the industrial revenue bonds were redeemed by us  and as a result  the remaining million gain was recognized in interest expense during in march  we entered into million of interest rate swaps on the senior notes due notes 
the counterparty to the million agreements is citibank  na  a major f inancial institution 
we have designated the swap agreements as fair value hedges of the risk of changes in the value of fixed rate debt due to changes in interest rates for a portion of our fixed rate borrowings 
accordingly  the swap agreements have been recorded at their fair market value of million and are included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related debt 
no gain or loss has been recorded as the contracts met the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting treatment with no ineffectiveness 
in and  we entered into interest rate swaps on million of our underlying fixed rate debt obligations  whereby we agreed to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
the counterparty to these agreements is citibank  na  a major financial institution 
in january  we entered into a million fixed interest rate swap with equal and opposite terms as the million variable interest rate swaps on the senior notes due in notes 
we have agreed to pay a fixed rate to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us variable rates 
the counterparty to this agreement is bank of america  a major financial institution 
the result was a gain of million on the million variable interest rate swaps  which will be recognized throug h as of december   million of this gain was included in current installments of long term debt 
in january  we de designated our million interest rate swaps that had previously been designated as fair value hedges 
the million variable interest rate swaps and the million fixed interest rate swap do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting 
all changes in the fair value of these interest rate swaps are recorded currently in earnings 
we have registered an undetermined amount of securities with the sec  so that  from time to time  we may issue debt securities  preferred stock and or common stock and associated warrants in the public market under that registration statement 
off balance sheet arrangements our operating lease commitments are primarily for railroad cars but also include distribution  warehousing and office space and data processing and office equipment 
virtually none of our lease agreements contain escalation clauses or step rent provisions 
assets under capital leases are not significant 
in conjunction with the st 
gabriel  la conversion and expansion project  which was completed in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a twenty year brine and pipeline supply agreement with petrologistics olefins  llc petrologistics 
petrologistics installed  owns and operates  at its own expense  a pipeline supplying brine to the st 
gabriel  la facility 
beginning november  we are obligated to make a fixed annual payment over the life of the contract of million for use of the pipeline  regardless of the amount of brine purchased 
we also have a minimum usage requirement for brine of million over the first five year period of the contract 
after the first five year period  the contract contains a buy out provision exercisable by us for million 
on december   we entered into a long term  sulfur dioxide supply agreement with alliance specialty chemicals  inc alliance  formerly known as rfc so  inc alliance has the obligation to deliver annually  tons of sulfur dioxide 
alliance owns the sulfur dioxide plant  which is located at our charleston  tn facility and is operated by us 
the price for the sulfur dioxide is fixed over the life of the contract and  under the terms of the contract  we are obligated to make a monthly payment of million regardless of the amount of sulfur dioxide purchased 
commitments related to this agreement are million in and million in this supply agreement expires in we and our partner  polyone  own equally sunbelt 
oxy vinyls is required to purchase thousand tons of chlorine based on a formula related to its market price 
prior to july  polyone had an ownership interest in oxy vinyls 
we market the excess chlorine and all of the caustic soda produced 
the construction of this plant and equipment was financed by the issuance of million of guaranteed senior secured notes due sunbelt sold million of guaranteed senior secured notes due  series o  and million of guaranteed senior secured notes due  series g 
we refer to these notes as the sunbelt notes 
the sunbelt notes bear interest at a rate of per annum payable semiannually in arrears on each june and december we have guaranteed the series o notes  and polyone has guaranteed the series g notes  in both cases pursuant to customary guaranty agreements 
our guarantee and polyone s guarantee are several  rather than joint 
therefore  we are not required to make any payments to satisfy the series g notes guaranteed by polyone 
an insolvency or bankruptcy of polyone will not automatically trigger acceleration of the sunbelt notes or cause us to be required to make payments under our guarantee  even if polyone is required to make payments under its guarantee 
however  if sunbelt does not make timely payments on the sunbelt notes  whether as a result of a failure to pay on a guarantee or otherwise  the holders of the sunbelt notes may proceed against the assets of sunbelt for repayment 
if we were to m ake debt service payments under our guarantee  we would have a right to recover such payments from sunbelt 
beginning on december  and each year through  sunbelt is required to repay million of the sunbelt notes  of which million is attributable to the series o notes 
after the payment of million on the series o notes in december  our guarantee of these notes was million 
in the event sunbelt cannot make any of these payments  we would be required to fund the payment on the series o notes 
in certain other circumstances  we may also be required to repay the sunbelt notes prior to their maturity 
we and polyone have agreed that  if we or polyone intend to transfer our respective interests in sunbelt and the transferring party is unable to obtain consent from holders of of the aggregate principal amount of the indebtedness related to the guarantee being trans ferred after good faith negotiations  then we and polyone will be required to repay our respective portions of the sunbelt notes 
in such event  any make whole or similar penalties or costs will be paid by the transferring party 
excluding our guarantee of the sunbelt notes described above  our long term contractual commitments  including the on and off balance sheet arrangements  consisted of the following payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions debt obligations interest payments under debt obligations and interest rate swap agreements a contingent tax liability fin qualified pension plan contributions b non qualified pension plan payments postretirement benefit payments off balance sheet commitments noncancelable operating leases purchasing commitments raw materials utilities total a for the purposes of this table  we have assumed for all periods presented that there are no changes in the principal amount of any variable rate debt from the amounts outstanding on december  and that there are no changes in the rates from those in effect at december  which ranged from to 
b these amounts are only estimated payments assuming an annual expected rate of return on pension plan assets of  and a discount rate on pension plan obligations of 
these estimated payments are subject to significant variation and the actual payments may be more than the amounts estimated 
given the inherent uncertainty as to actual minimum funding requirements for qualified defined benefit pension plans  no amounts are included in this table for any period beyond one year 
based on the current funding requirements  we will not be required to make any cash contributions to the domestic defined benefit pension plan at least through we do have a small canadian defined benefit pension plan to which we made million and million of cash contributions in and  respectively  and we anticipate less than million of cash contributions in  see discussion on pension protection act of amended by the worker  retiree  and employer recovery act in pension plans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
non cancelable operating leases and purchasing commitments are utilized in our normal course of business for our projected needs 
for losses that we believe are probable and which are estimable we have accrued for such amounts in our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to the table above  we have various commitments and contingencies including defined benefit and postretirement healthcare plans as described below  environmental matters see environmental matters included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and litigation claims see item legal proceedings 
we have several defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans  as described in the pension plans note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we fund the defined benefit pension plans based on the minimum amounts required by law plus such amounts we deem appropriate 
we have postretirement healthcare plans that provide health and life insurance benefits to certain retired employees and their beneficiaries  as described in the postretirement benefits note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these other postretirement plans are not pre funded and expenses are paid by us as incurred 
we also have standby letters of credit of million of which million have been issued through our senior revolving credit facility 
at december   we had million available under our senior revolving credit facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant estimates in our consolidated financial statements include goodwill recoverability  environmental  restructuring and other unusual items  litigation  income tax reserves including deferred tax asset valuation allowances  pension  postretirement and other benefits and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on prior ex perience  facts and circumstances and other assumptions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill goodwill is not amortized  but is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter and or when circumstances or other events indicate that impairment may have occurred 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the business climate  a significant adverse legal judgment  adverse cash flow trends  an adverse action or assessment by a government agency  unanticipated competition  decline in our stock price  and a significant restructuring charge within a reporting unit 
the annual impairment test involves the comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount 
we define reporting units at the business segment level or one level below the business segment  which for our chlor alkali products segment are the us operations and canadian operations 
for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment  goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit 
we use a discounted cash flow approach to develop the estimated fair value of a reporting unit 
management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model 
we also corroborate our discounted cash flow analysis by evaluating a market based approach that considers earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiples from a representative sample of comparable public companies in the chemical industry 
an impairment would be recorded if the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value 
no impairment charges were recorded for  or the discount rate  profitability assumptions  terminal growth rate and cyclical nature of our chlor alkali business are the material assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit 
the discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital  which is calculated based on observable market data 
some of these data such as the risk free or treasury rate and the pretax cost of debt are based on the market data at a point in time 
other data such as the equity risk premium are based upon market data over time for a peer group of companies in the chemical manufacturing industry with a market capitalization premium added  as applicable 
the discounted cash flow analysis requires estimates  assumptions and judgments about future events 
our analysis uses our internally generated long range plan 
our discounted cash flow analysis uses the assumptions in our long range plan about terminal growth rates  forecasted capital expenditures  and changes in future working capital requirements to determine the implied fair value of each reporting unit 
the long range plan reflects management judgment  supplemented by independent chemical industry analyses which provide multi year chlor alkali industry operating and pricing forecasts 
we believe the assumptions used in our discounted cash flow analysis are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the implied fair value of each reporting unit 
however  given the economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions  made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter of  will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit 
in all cases  the estimated fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units by a substantial amount 
we also ap plied a hypothetical decrease of basis points in our terminal growth rate or an increase of basis points in our weighted average cost of capital to test the fair value calculation 
the estimated fair value of the reporting units derived in these calculations also exceeded our book value by a substantial amount for each of our reporting units 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted sales or gross margins are not achieved  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
environmental accruals charges to income for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing technologies 
these amounts  which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties  are adjusted periodically as assessments and remediation efforts progress or additional technical or legal information becomes available 
environmental costs are capitalized if the costs increase the value of the property and or mitigate or prevent contamination from future operations 
environmental costs and recoveries are included in costs of goods sold 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  changes in regulatory authorities  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other prps and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably to us  which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
pension and postretirement plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans and non pension postretirement benefit plans using actuarial models required by asc  formerly sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions sfas no 
and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pension sfas no 
 respectively 
these models use an attribution approach that generally spreads the financial impact of changes to the plan and actuarial assumptions over the average remaining service lives of the employees in the plan 
changes in liability due to changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rate  rate of compensation increases and mortality  as well as annual deviations between what was assumed and what was experienced by the plan are treated as gains or l osses 
the principle underlying the required attribution approach is that employees render service over their average remaining service lives on a relatively smooth basis and  therefore  the accounting for benefits earned under the pension or non pension postretirement benefits plans should follow the same relatively smooth pattern 
substantially all defined benefit pension plan participants are inactive  therefore  actuarial gains and losses are amortized based upon the remaining life expectancy of the inactive plan participants 
for the years ended december  and  the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants in the defined benefit pension plan was years 
one of the key assumptions for the net periodic pension calculation is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  used to determine the market related value of assets 
the market related value of assets recognizes differences between the plan s actual return and expected return over a five year period 
the required use of an expected long term rate of return on the market related value of plan assets may result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns and  therefore  result in a pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provi ded by the employees 
as differences between actual and expected returns are recognized over five years  they subsequently generate gains and losses that are subject to amortization over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive plan participants  as described in the preceding paragraph 
we use long term historical actual return information  the mix of investments that comprise plan assets  and future estimates of long term investment returns and inflation by reference to external sources to develop the expected return on plan assets as of december the discount rate assumptions used for pension and non pension postretirement benefit plan accounting reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments on december of each year 
the rate of compensation increase is based upon our long term plans for such increases 
for retiree medical plan accounting  we review external data and our own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates 
changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions resulting from economic events 
for example  holding all other assumptions constant  a basis point decrease or increase in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased  respectively  the defined benefit pension plan income by approximately million 
holding all other assumptions constant  a basis point decrease in the discount rate used to calculate pension income for and the projected benefit obligation as of december  would have decreased pension income by million and increased the projected benefit obligation by million 
a basis point increase in the discount rate used to calculate pension income for and the projected benefit obligation as of december  would have increased pension income by million and decreased the projected benefit obligation by million

new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu  which amends asc fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
this update adds new fair value disclosure requirements about transfers into and out of level and and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements related to level measurements 
this update expands disclosures on valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value 
this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   except for the requirement to provide the level activity of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements  which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   we adopted the provisions of asu on january   except for the requirement to provide the additional level activity  which will be adopted in as of december   we had no assets or liabilities recorded at fair value using level measurements

in february  the fasb issued asu subsequent events amendments to certain recogn ition and disclosure requirements  which removed the requirements in asc for an sec filer to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated for both issued and revised financial statements 
this update became effective upon issuance for us and the adoption of this update did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
derivative financial instruments asc derivatives and hedging asc  formerly sfas no 
 required an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
we use hedge accounting treatment for substantially all of our business transactions whose risks are covered using derivative instruments 
the accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and  if so  the type of hedge 
for derivatives designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of both the derivative and the hedged item are recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
ineffective portions are recognized currently in earnings 
unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are recognized currently in earnings 
all derivatives recognized in earnings impact the expense line item on our consolidated statement of operations that is consistent with the nature of the underlying hedged item 
we enter into forward sales and purchase contracts to manage currency risk resulting from purchase and sale commitments denominated in foreign currencies principally canadian dollar and euro 
all of the currency derivatives expire within one year and are for united states dollar equivalents 
at december  and  we had forward contracts to sell foreign currencies with a notional value of zero and million  respectively 
at december  and  we had forward contracts to buy foreign currencies with a notional value of million and million  respectively 
we use cash flow hedges for certain raw material and energy costs such as copper  zinc  lead  electricity  and natural gas to provide a measure of stability in managing our exposure to price fluctuations associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials and energy costs used in our manufacturing process 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized as a component of other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized into earnings 
gains and losses on the derivatives representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized currently in earnings 
gains on settled futures contracts were million million  net of taxes in  which were included in cost of goods sold 
losses on settled fu tures contracts were million  million  net of taxes and million million  net of taxes in and  respectively  which were included in cost of goods sold 
at december   we had open positions in futures contracts through totaling million million 
if all open futures contracts had been settled on december   we would have recognized a pretax gain of million 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive loss included a gain  net of taxes  in fair value on commodity forward contracts of million 
if commodity prices were to remain at the levels they were at december   approximately million of deferred gains  net of tax  would be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months 
the actual effect on earnings will be dependent on commodity prices when the forecasted transactions occur 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive loss included a gain  net of taxes  in fair value on commodity forward contracts of million 
we use interest rate swaps as a means of managing interest expense and floating interest rate exposure to optimal levels 
the accounting for gains and losses associated with changes in fair value of the derivative and the effect on the consolidated financial statements will depend on the hedge designation and whether the hedge is effective in offsetting changes in fair value of cash flows of the asset or liability being hedged 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings 
we include the gain or loss on the hedged items fixed rate borrowings in the same line item  interest expense  as the offsetting loss or ga in on the related interest rate swaps 
as of december  and  the total notional amount of our interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges were million and million  respectively 
in and  we entered into interest rate swaps on million of our underlying fixed rate debt obligations  whereby we agreed to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
in january  we entered into a million fixed interest rate swap with equal and opposite terms as the million variable interest rate swaps on the notes 
we have agreed to pay a fixed rate to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us variable rates 
the result was a gain of million on the million variable interest rate swaps  which will be recognized through as of december   million of this gain was included in current installments of long term debt 
in january  we de designated our million interest rate swaps that had previously be en designated as fair value hedges 
the million variable interest rate swaps and the million fixed interest rate swap do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting 
all changes in the fair value of these interest rate swaps are recorded currently in earnings 
the fair value of our derivative asset and liability balances were december  in millions other current assets other assets total derivative asset current installments of long term debt accrued liabilities other liabilities long term debt total derivative liability the ineffective portion of changes in fair value resulted in zero  million and zero credited to earnings for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our foreign currency forward contracts  certain commodity derivatives  and our million fixed and variable interest rate swaps did not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting 
the effect on operating results of items not qualifying for hedge accounting was a charge of million for  million for and zero for item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our purchases of certain commodities  our ongoing investing and financing activities  and our operations that use foreign currencies 
the risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows and future earnings 
we have established policies and procedures governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage exposure to such risks 
energy costs including electricity used in our chlor alkali products segment  and certain raw materials and energy costs  namely copper  lead  zinc  electricity  and natural gas used primarily in our winchester segment are subject to price volatility 
depending on market conditions  we may enter into futures contracts and put and call option contracts in order to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations 
as of december   we maintained open positions on futures contracts totaling million million at december  
assuming a hypothetical increase in commodity prices  which are currently hedged  as of december   we would experience a million million at december  increase in our cost of inventory purchased  which would be substantially offset by a corresponding increase in the value of related hedging instruments 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our investing and financing activities 
the effect of interest rates on investing activity is not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
our current debt structure is used to fund business operations  and commitments from banks under our senior revolving credit facility are a source of liquidity 
as of december   we had long term borrowings of million million at december  of which million million at december  was issued at variable rates 
as a result of the amount of variable rate financings compared to our fixed rate financings  we entered into floating interest rate swaps in order to manage interest expense and floating inte rest rate exposure to optimal levels 
we have entered into million of such swaps  whereby we agree to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
in april  citibank  na terminated million of interest rate swaps on our industrial revenue bonds due in the result was a gain of million  which would have been recognized through in september  the industrial revenue bonds were redeemed by us  and as a result  the remaining million gain was recognized in interest expense during in march  we entered into million of interest rate swaps on the notes 
the counterparty to the million agreements is citibank  na  a major financial institution 
in all cases the underlying index for the variable rates is six month libor 
accordingly  payments are settled every six months and the terms of the swaps are the same as the underlying debt instruments 
in and  we entered into interest rate swaps on million of our underlying fixed rate debt obligations  whereby we agreed to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
the counterparty to these agreements is citibank  na in january  we entered into a million fixed interest rate swap with equal and opposite terms as the million variable interest rate swaps on the notes 
we have agreed to pay a fixed rate to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us variable rates 
the counterparty to this agreement is bank of america  a major financial institution 
the result was a gain of million on the million variable interest rate swaps  which will be recognized through as of december   million of this g ain was included in current installments of long term debt 
assuming no changes in the million of variable rate debt levels from december   we estimate that a hypothetical change of basis points in the libor interest rates from would impact annual interest expense by million 
the following table reflects the swap activity related to certain debt obligations underlying debt instrument swap amount date of swap december  in millions olin pays floating rate  due december  due march a  due march a  due march a industrial development obligation at a fixed interest rate of due march olin receives floating rate  due january a actual rate is set in arrears 
we project the rate will fall within the range shown 
these interest rate swaps reduced interest expense by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
if the actual change in interest or commodities pricing is substantially different than expected  the net impact of interest rate risk or commodity risk on our cash flow may be materially different than that disclosed above 
we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
