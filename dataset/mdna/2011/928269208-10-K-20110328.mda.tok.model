this discussion contains forward looking statements  the accuracy of which involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements for many reasons including  but not limited to  those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
we disclaim any obligation to update information contained in any forward looking statements 
overview virtualscopics  inc is a leading provider of imaging solutions to accelerate drug and medical device development 
we have developed a robust software platform for analysis and modeling of both structural and functional medical images 
in combination with our industry leading experience and expertise in advanced imaging biomarker measurement  this platform provides a uniquely clear window into the biological activity of drugs and devices in clinical trial patients  allowing our customers to make better decisions faster 
in july  virtualscopics was formed after being spun out of the university of rochester 
in june  we purchased the underlying technology and patents created by virtualscopics founders from the university of rochester 
in november  we performed an exchange transaction with consultamerica whereby prior to the exchange consultamerica  inc had no meaningful operations and  therefore  the exchange was treated as recapitalization of virtualscopics  llc 
following the transaction  we succeeded to the business of virtualscopics  inc as a provider of image based biomarker solutions and have continued this business since that time 
we own all rights to the patents underlying its technology 
revenue over the past nine years has been derived primarily from image processing services in connection with pharmaceutical drug trials 
for these services  we have been concentrating in the areas of oncology and osteoarthritis 
we have also derived a small portion of revenue from consulting services  and pharmaceutical drug trials in the neurology and cardiovascular areas 
we expect that the concentration of our revenue will continue in these services and in those areas in revenues are recognized as the mri and ct images that we process are quantified and delivered to our customers and or the services are performed 
beginning in  we began to pursue the personalized medicine market  however  we do not anticipate significant revenues from this market opportunity in as we are just beginning the process of executing on our regulatory  validation and commercialization strategy 
as of december   the amount remaining to be earned from active projects and awards was approximately million 
once we enter into a new contract for participation in a drug trial  there are several factors that can effect whether we will realize the full benefits under the contract  and the time over which we will realize that revenue 
customers may not continue our services due to performance reasons with their compounds in development 
furthermore  the contracts may contemplate performance over multiple years 
therefore  revenue may not be realized in the fiscal year in which the contract is signed or the award is made 
recognition of revenue under the contract may also be affected by the timing of patient recruitment and image site identification and training 
additionally  the majority of contracts we have with customers are cancelable for any reason by giving days advance notice 
results of operations results of operations for year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues we had revenues of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   representing a increase 
the increase in revenues is directly related to the growing demand for our services in the industry 
we continue to see greater demand for our oncology analysis services as well as demand within the medical device industry 
during  we performed work for customers  representing different projects  in connection with their pharmaceutical drug trials primarily in the fields of oncology and musculoskeletal diseases osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis along with various other projects 
this compares to customers representing projects in at the end of  our backlog amounts remaining to be earned from active projects and awards was million  this compares to a backlog at the end of of million  representing an increase 
as of the date of this report the backlog was million  the reduction in the backlog from the end of is a result of recognized revenue for january and february as well as the cancellation of a few projects 
as of december   we had active projects with of the leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the world 
in  of our revenues were generated from phase ii and phase iii studies compared to in additionally  for the year ended december   oncology  musculoskeletal and other projects represented   and  respectively  of our revenues 
this compares to   and  respectively  for gross profit we had a gross profit of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the comparable period in our gross profit improved year over year due to the increase in revenues as outlined above 
our gross margin is a reflection of the project mix that we experience during a given period 
start up activities associated with getting a project underway  including site initiation  qualification and training  yield a higher margin than image analyses 
therefore  depending on the project mix  we may experience fluctuations in our reported margins 
we anticipate our gross margins excluding reimbursements will approximate throughout based on the projects that are currently in our pipeline 
research and development research and development costs increased in by  or  to  when compared to the increase was largely attributed to the allocation of resources within our research and development group during between internal and customer related projects 
as of december   there were ten employees in our research and development group  this includes the algorithm and software development functions 
our research and development efforts are centered around improving the functionality of our existing algorithms and software platform as well as the refinement of our algorithms to new therapeutic areas 
in  we anticipate making investments within our software platform in order to generate more operating efficiencies and enhanced reporting tools as well as costs associated with our k filing with the fda for our personalized medicine software application 
sales and marketing sales and marketing costs decreased in by  or  to  when compared to the decrease was a result of the departure of our vp of business development during in february  we hired an experienced individual in the position of vp and business development to drive greater penetration of the market

we also plan to continue to develop our strategic alliance with ppd to expand and deepen new and existing customer relationships through an integrated joint solution to the industry 
as of the date of this report  there are six individuals in our sales and marketing department 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  representing a decrease of  or  when compared to the slight decrease is mainly due to the reduction in stock compensation expense for vested stock options offset by higher consulting costs associated with our personalized medicine application 
during  the company anticipates higher general and administrative costs as it continues its investment in its personalized medicine application 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization charges increased for the year ended december  by  or  to  when compared to this increase is attributed to the depreciation of newly purchased hardware and software to support the growth in revenues and employees 
the amortization and depreciation costs are based on the timing and life of the patent costs and property and equipment 
we continue to invest in our patent portfolio  however  do not anticipate significant expenditures to support our current business and future strategies 
our it systems are the basis of our operating platform  therefore  we will continue to invest in our it infrastructure to support our growth and ensure we have a robust and reliable operating system 
other income expense  net interest income for the year ended december  was  representing interest derived on the company s operating and savings accounts  compared to interest income of  in the increase in interest income was due to higher average account balances

additionally  we recognized a non cash marked to market adjustment of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to the loss in fair value of warrants that were issued in connection with our series b offering see financial statement note 
due to the price reset  or ratchet  provision within the warrant agreements  the accounting pronouncements require us to mark to market the change in fair value of the warrants during the reporting period 
if our stock price appreciates during the reporting period  we report a loss  if our stock price declines  we will report a gain 
net loss our net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  the decrease in our net loss over the prior period was related to higher revenues and controlled operating expenditures offset by the non cash marked to market adjustment for the change in the fair value of certain outstanding warrants 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital as of december  and was approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in working capital was a result of the increase in operating income  cash and accounts receivable offset by increases in the liability associated with the valuation of warrants issued in our series b offering  in accordance with accounting standards codification asc net cash provided by operating activities in was  compared to  in the decrease in the amount of cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of the increase and timing of collection of our receivables due to the increased revenues 
also impacting our cash provided by operating activities was the reduction in the amount of unearned revenue at the end of compared to the end of we invested  in the purchase of equipment and the acquisition of patents in  compared to  for the investment in these items in this decrease represents a decrease in computer hardware and software purchased in compared to due to investments made in our storage and hardware equipment in we anticipate that our it related costs will increase in as we support our growth which requires additional investments to be made in our operating system and infrastructure 
during  we incurred  in patent costs associated with filing costs for intellectual property  as compared to  in the reduction is due to the timing of office actions within our existing patent filings 
net cash used in financing activities in was  compared to  in this decrease was due to lower required dividend payments on our series b preferred shares due to the conversion of the securities by the holders to common stock 
we currently expect that existing cash will be sufficient to fund our existing operations for the next months and foreseeable future 
if in the future our plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to seek additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings 
if we need to raise additional funds  we may not be able to do so on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if we cannot raise sufficient funds on acceptable terms  we may have to curtail our level of expenditures and our rate of expansion

 revenue recognition milestone method topic milestone method of revenue recognition 
this standard provides that the milestone method is a valid application of the proportional performance model for revenue recognition if the milestones are substantive and there is substantive uncertainty about whether the milestones will be achieved 
determining whether a milestone is substantive requires judgment that should be made at the inception of the arrangement 
to meet the definition of a substantive milestone  the consideration earned by achieving the milestone would have to be commensurate with either the level of effort required to achieve the milestone or the enhancement in the value of the item delivered  would have to relate solely to past performance  and should be reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
no bifurcation of an individual milestone is allowed and there can be more than one milestone in an arrangement 
the new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations
