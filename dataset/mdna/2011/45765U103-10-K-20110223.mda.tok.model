our strategic vision is to be the trusted advisor to our clients  helping them enhance their business performance through innovative technology solutions 
our strategy is to grow profitable market share through the continued transformation of insight into a complete it solutions company  differentiating us in the marketplace and giving us a competitive advantage 
on a consolidated basis  for the year ended december   our net sales and resulting gross profit increased by and  respectively  while gross margin declined basis points to 
net sales for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  increased in north america  in emea and in apac 
net sales in returned to pre recessionary levels with a margin decline resulting from a change in mix of our business to a higher contribution from lower margin hardware and software sales and a lower contribution from higher margin sales of services 
we reported net earnings from continuing operations of million and diluted net earnings from continuing operations per share of for the year ended december  in  we reported net earnings from continuing operations of million and diluted net earnings from continuing operations per share of and net earnings from a discontinued operation of million  net of tax  or per share  as a result of the favorable settlement on july  of an arbitrated claim related to the sale of direct alliance  a former subsidiary that was sold on june  in  we reported a net loss from continuing operations of million and a diluted net loss from continuing operations per share of for the year  primarily as a result of a million goodwill impairment charge

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the results of operations for the year ended december  include the effect of the following items goodwill impairment charge of million  million net of tax  foreign currency losses of million  million net of tax  severance and restructuring expenses of million  million net of tax  and foreign tax credit impairment of million 
net of tax amounts referenced above were computed using the effective tax rate for the taxing jurisdictions in the operating segment in which the related expense was recorded 
the majority of the goodwill impairment charges in emea and apac were non deductible and therefore had no tax effect 
during  we generated million of cash flows from operations  which were net of cash outlays of million in to settle trade credit liabilities as part of our compliance with state unclaimed property laws  and paid down our revolving credit facility by million  ending the year with million of cash and cash equivalents and million of debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
on july   we acquired minx limited minx  a united kingdom based networking services company  for a cash purchase price of approximately million and the assumption of approximately million of existing debt 
founded in  minx is a network integrator with cisco gold partner accreditation in the united kingdom 
we believe this acquisition has significantly enhanced our capabilities in the sale  implementation and management of network infrastructure services and solutions in our emea operating segment and complements our april  acquisition of calence in our north america operating segment 
on april   we completed the acquisition of calence  llc calence  an independent technology solutions provider in the united states specializing in cisco networking solutions  advanced communications and managed services  for a cash purchase price of million plus a working capital adjustment of approximately million 
during the year ended december   and  we recorded an additional  million and million  respectively  of purchase price consideration and the related accrued interest thereon as a result of calence achieving certain performance targets during each year 
such amounts were recorded as additional goodwill 
see discussion relating to goodwill in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
we also assumed calence s existing debt totaling approximately million  of which million was repaid by us at closing in as we have previously disclosed  the company s largest software partner has informed resellers that it intends to change certain elements of its channel incentive programs effective in late  and those changes could adversely affect the company s results of operations  primarily beginning in we currently expect the financial effect to be immaterial to our financial performance in additional details of the new programs have recently been announced and as a result  we now expect the full year effect to be a reduction of gross profit of between and million 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that contributed to those changes  as well as how certain critical accounting estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates general our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
for a summary of significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  however  may differ from estimates we have made 
members of our senior management have discussed the critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we consider the following to be our critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements sales recognition sales are recognized when title and risk of loss are passed to the client  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our usual sales terms are fob shipping point or equivalent  at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the client 
however  because we either i have a general practice of covering client losses while products are in transit despite title and risk of loss contractually transferring at the point of shipment or ii have specifically stated fob destination contractual terms with the client  delivery is not deemed to have occurred until the point in time when the product is received by the client 
we make provisions for estimated product returns that we expect to occur under our return policy based upon historical return rates 
our manufacturers warrant most of the products we market  and it is our policy to request that clients return their defective products directly to the manufacturer for warranty service 
on selected products  and for selected client service reasons  we may accept returns directly from the client and then either credit the client or ship a replacement product 
we generally offer a limited to day return policy for unopened products and certain opened products  which are consistent with manufacturers terms  however  for some products we may charge restocking fees 
products returned opened are processed and returned to the manufacturer or partner for repair  replacement or credit to us 
we resell most unopened products returned to us 
products that cannot be returned to the manufacturer for warranty processing but are in working condition are sold to inventory liquidators  to end users as previously sold or used products  or through other channels to reduce our losses from returned products 
we record freight billed to our clients as net sales and the related freight costs as costs of goods sold 
we report sales net of any sales based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with sales transactions 
revenue is recognized from software sales when clients acquire the right to use or copy software under license  but in no case prior to the commencement of the term of the initial software license agreement  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met ie  delivery  evidence of the arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee is probable 
from time to time  the sale of hardware and software products may also include the provision of services and the associated contracts contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
sales of services currently represent a small percentage of our net sales  and a significant amount of services that are performed in conjunction with hardware and software sales are completed in our facilities prior to shipment of the product 
in these circumstances  net sales for the hardware  software and services are recognized upon delivery 
net sales of services that are performed at client locations are often service only contracts and are recorded as sales when the services are performed and completed 
if the service is performed at a client location in conjunction with a hardware  software or other services sale  we recognize net sales for delivered items only when all of the following criteria are satisfied the delivered item s has value to the client on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
we sell certain third party service contracts and software assurance or subscription products for which we are not the primary obligor 
these sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition and  thus  are recorded on a net sales recognition basis 
as we enter into contracts with third party service providers or vendors  we evaluate whether the subsequent sales of such services should be recorded as gross sales or net sales 
we determine whether we act as a principal in the transaction and assume the risks and rewards of ownership or if we are simply acting as an agent or broker 
under gross sales recognition  the entire selling price is recorded in sales and our cost to the third party service provider or vendor is recorded in costs of goods sold 
under net sales recognition  the cost to the third party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction to sales  resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction  and there are no costs of goods sold 

table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued additionally  we sell certain professional services contracts on a fixed fee basis 
revenues for fixed fee professional services contracts are recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
net sales for these service contracts are not a significant portion of our consolidated net sales 
partner funding we receive payments and credits from partners  including consideration pursuant to volume sales incentive programs  volume purchase incentive programs and shared marketing expense programs 
partner funding received pursuant to volume sales incentive programs is recognized as it is earned as a reduction to costs of goods sold 
partner funding received pursuant to volume purchase incentive programs is allocated as a reduction to inventories based on the applicable incentives earned from each partner and is recorded in costs of goods sold as the inventory is sold 
changes in estimates of anticipated achievement levels under individual partner programs may affect our results of operations and our cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further discussion of our accounting policies related to partner funding 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation expense for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award 
starting in  we elected to primarily issue service based and performance based restricted stock units rsus 
the number of rsus ultimately awarded under performance based rsus varies based on whether we achieve certain financial results 
we record compensation expense each period based on our estimate of the most probable number of rsus that will be issued under the grants of performance based rsus 
for any stock options awarded  modifications to previous awards or awards of rsus that are tied to specified market conditions  we use option pricing models or lattice binomial models to determine fair value of the awards 
the estimated fair value of stock options is determined on the date of the grant using the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires us to apply highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  expected life of the option and the risk free interest rate 
a change in one or more of the assumptions used in the option pricing model may result in a material change to the estimated fair value of the stock based compensation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further discussion of stock based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using estimated losses on accounts receivable based on evaluation of the aging of the receivables  historical write offs and the current economic environment 
should our clients or vendors circumstances change or actual collections of client and vendor receivables differ from our estimates  adjustments to the provision for losses on accounts receivable and the related allowances for doubtful accounts would be recorded 
see further information on our allowance for doubtful accounts in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
valuation of long lived assets including purchased intangible assets and goodwill we review property  plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment  our asset impairment review assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any and compares that value to the carrying value 
such impairment test is based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the carrying value exceeds the future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying amount 
this approach uses our estimates of future market growth  forecasted net sales and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized and appropriate discount rates 

table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we perform an annual review of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of every year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the carrying value of our recorded goodwill is impaired 
we continually assess whether any indicators of impairment exist  which requires a significant amount of judgment 
events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future cash flows or results of operations 
any adverse change in these factors  among others  could have a significant effect on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management of the segment regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
when two or more components of an operating segment have similar economic characteristics  the components may be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit 
an operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar  if none of its components is a reporting unit  or if the segment comprises only a single component 
insight has three reporting units  which are equivalent to our operating segments 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step analysis 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  we first compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its book value  including goodwill 
management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
multiple valuation techniques can be used to assess the fair value of the reporting unit  including the market and income approaches 
all of these techniques include the use of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or goodwill impairment  or both 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  an appropriate control premium in excess of the market capitalization of the company  future market growth  forecasted sales and costs and appropriate discount rates 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management evaluates the merits of each significant assumption  both individually and in the aggregate  used to determine the fair value of the reporting units 
if the estimated fair value exceeds book value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary 
to ensure the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of our reporting units  we perform a reconciliation of our total market capitalization to the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value  then we are required to perform the second step of the impairment analysis by comparing the carrying amount of the goodwill with its implied fair value 
in step two of the analysis  we utilize the fair value of the reporting unit computed in the first step to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
management must also apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these individual assets and liabilities and may include independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets  such as trademarks 
management also evaluates the merits of each significant assumption  both individually and in the aggregate  used to determine the fair values of these individual assets and liabilities 
if the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
see further information on the carrying value of goodwill and the impairment charges recorded in in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
severance and restructuring activities we have taken  and may continue to take  severance and restructuring actions which require us to utilize significant estimates of costs relating to employee termination benefits and costs to terminate leases or remaining lease commitments on unused facilities  net of estimated subleases 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  adjustments to severance and restructuring expenses in subsequent periods would be necessary 
a detailed description of our severance  restructuring and acquisition integration activities and remaining accruals for these activities at december  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued income taxes our effective tax rate includes the effect of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the us earnings remittance amounts are planned based on the projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements could affect our effective tax rate 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider past operating results  future market growth  forecasted earnings  historical and projected taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and statutory tax law changes in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
if we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that all or part of the net deferred tax assets would be realized  then all or part of the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
effective january   any change in a valuation allowance and uncertain tax positions established in purchase accounting will be a benefit to  or charge against  earnings 
additional information about the valuation allowance can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
contingencies from time to time  we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties 
we are also subject to various governmental  client and vendor audits 
we continually assess whether or not such claims have merit and warrant accrual if it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
where appropriate  we accrue estimates of anticipated liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
such estimates are subject to change and may affect our results of operations and our cash flows 
additional information about contingencies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report

the increase in hardware and software net sales is primarily due to higher volume with the year over year improvement in the demand environment for it products compared to the depressed levels of it spending experienced in north america in the decrease in sales of services year to year resulted primarily from a large services engagement in that did not recur in the current year

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued gross profit 
gross profit increased to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   with a basis point decrease in gross margin 
our gross profit and gross profit as a percent of net sales by operating segment for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in thousands of net of net sales sales north america emea apac consolidated north america s gross profit for the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december   but as a percentage of net sales  gross margin declined by basis points year to year  due primarily to a basis point decrease in margin from the sale of services associated with the large services engagement during that did not recur in the current year and a decrease in margin related to agency fees for enterprise software agreements of basis points 
these decreases in margin were offset by a basis point increase in product margin  which includes vendor funding and freight  driven primarily by sales in our hardware category 
contributing to this increase in product margin was the extinguishment of million of certain restatement related trade credits during the year ended december  compared to million in  through negotiated settlement or other legal release of the recorded liabilities  which contributed basis points to the increase in margin 
emea s gross profit increased in us dollars for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  excluding the effects of foreign currency movements  gross profit was up compared to the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross margin declined basis points due primarily to decreases in agency fees for enterprise software agreement renewals of basis points 
apac s gross profit increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  excluding the effects of foreign currency movements  gross profit increased compared to the prior year

these increases resulted primarily from changes in client and publisher mix 
operating expenses 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased million or in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily attributable to increases in variable compensation on increased sales 
selling and administrative expenses decreased basis points as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as we continued our expense management initiatives

increases in variable costs of million on higher sales in the year ended december  and increased bonus and non cash stock based compensation expense resulting from over attainment against our operating plan were mostly offset by i a million decline in legal and professional fees year to year  primarily related to professional fees and costs associated with the trade credits restatement as well as a decrease in our annual audit fee and ii a million decrease resulting from the effect on the year to year comparison of the prior year non cash stock based compensation charges 
these charges related to the north america portion of the termination of an equity based incentive compensation plan relating to certain of our executive officers in february that did not recur in further  selling and administrative expenses in the year ended december  were reduced by million upon the collection of a single account receivable which we had specifically reserved as doubtful during the fourth quarter of

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued emea s selling and administrative expenses increased  or million in us dollars  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  excluding the effects of foreign currency movements  selling and administrative expenses increased compared to the prior year 
this year over year increase was primarily driven by higher variable compensation and sales incentives on increased net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative expenses decreased basis points due to relatively stable fixed personnel costs year to year while sales have increased in selling and administrative expenses for the year ended december  included million of non cash stock based compensation charges related to the emea portion of the termination of an equity based incentive compensation plan in the first quarter of that did not recur in as discussed above 
apac s selling and administrative expenses increased or million in us dollars  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  excluding the effects of foreign currency movements  selling and administrative expenses increased compared to the prior year 
the year over year increases in selling and administrative expenses are primarily attributable to increases in fixed compensation with increases in head count year over year and increases in variable compensation on higher sales in the year ended december  severance and restructuring expenses 
during the year ended december   north america and emea recorded severance expense of million and million  respectively 
the north america charge was part of the roll out of our new sales engagement model and plans to add new leadership in key areas  and the emea charge was associated with the severance for the elimination of certain positions based on a re alignment of roles and responsibilities 
in emea  million in new severance costs was offset by  of adjustments to prior severance accruals due to current period changes in estimates 
during the year ended december   north america  emea and apac recorded severance expense of million  million and  respectively  related to the departure of insight s former president and chief executive officer and ongoing restructuring efforts to reduce operating expenses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further discussion of severance and restructuring activities 
non operating income expense 
interest income 
interest income for the years ended december  and was generated through short term investments 
the increase in interest income year over year is primarily due to higher average cash and cash equivalent balances in interest expense 
interest expense primarily relates to borrowings under our financing facilities and capital lease obligation and imputed interest under our inventory financing facility 
in  we also accrued million for interest expense related to our anticipated unclaimed property settlement under two state programs in in  we reduced interest expense by  for a change in estimate of accrued interest upon settlement with these two states 
imputed interest under our inventory financing facility was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
after giving effect to these items  the remaining decrease in interest expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is due primarily to decreases in the weighted average borrowings outstanding as we have used excess cash to pay down debt 
net foreign currency exchange gains losses 
these gains losses result from foreign currency transactions  including the period end remeasurement of intercompany balances that are not considered long term in nature 
the change from a net foreign currency exchange gain in the prior year to a loss in the current year is due primarily to more volatility in the applicable exchange rates  particularly in our apac segment 
other expense  net 
other expense  net  consists primarily of bank fees associated with our cash management activities 
income tax expense 
our effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the effective tax rates in both years were less than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the recapitalization of a foreign subsidiary during the fourth quarter of each year 
further  our effective tax rate was also reduced by the true up of certain foreign deferred tax assets

the decline in software sales year over year primarily relates to program changes with our largest software partner 
the increase in services net sales is primarily due to several large professional services engagements during the year ended december   particularly a large professional services engagement that spanned the last three quarters of during  we continued to increase the mix of services as a percentage of our net sales  which increased from of net sales to of net sales year over year 
net sales in emea decreased million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  excluding the effects of foreign currency movements  net sales in emea decreased only million or year over year 
in us dollars  the negative year over year comparison resulted from a decline in hardware net sales and a decline in software net sales  partially offset by an increase in services  which grew year over year 
these results reflect the challenging global it demand environment as well as the previously announced changes in programs with our largest software partner 
the year over year improvement in sales of services primarily resulted from the contribution of minx  acquired in july our apac segment recognized net sales of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or  compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of the previously announced changes in programs with our largest software partner  offset by increased public sector spending in australia

gross profit on services net sales contributed basis points to the increase in margin year over year  reflecting the several large professional services engagements during the year ended december  discussed above  and gross profit generated by freight contributed basis points to the increase in margin year over year 
in addition  the extinguishment of million of certain restatement related trade credits during the year ended december   through negotiated settlement or other legal release of the recorded liabilities  contributed basis points to the increase in margin 
these increases were offset partially by decreases in agency fees for enterprise software agreement renewals of basis points and market pricing pressures which have driven decreases in product margin  which includes partner funding  of basis points

these gains losses result from foreign currency transactions  including the period end remeasurement of intercompany balances that are not considered long term in nature

net cash provided by operating activities 
cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  reflect our net earnings  adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expense  write downs of inventories and deferred income taxes 
also contributing to the cash flows from operating activities were increases in accounts payable and deferred revenue 
the increase in accounts payable reflects increased costs of goods sold associated with the increase in net sales in compared to the prior year 
these increases in operating cash flows were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventories and other current assets and decreases in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
the increase in accounts receivable also reflects increased net sales in compared to the prior year 
the increase in inventories in is primarily attributable to client specific inventory purchased in north america late in as a result of new client engagements and overall higher demand for hardware 
the decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities in was primarily due to payments made to settle certain state unclaimed property liabilities and to reduce income taxes payable

on july   we entered into an amendment to our accounts receivable securitization financing facility the abs facility  which amends certain provisions of the abs facility to improve availability in the borrowing base  as defined in the abs facility  but did not change the  maximum borrowing capacity 
specifically  the amendment i excludes from the borrowing base receivables of a specified obligor that had a negative impact on availability under the facility  ii creates a basket to allow up to of gross receivables with terms between and days to be eligible for borrowing  and iii increases to from the threshold above which the total amount of a particular obligor s receivables are treated as ineligible if the percentage of such obligor s receivables that are more than days past due exceeds such threshold 
in addition  the amendment extends the maturity date of the abs facility to april   and decreases the variable interest rate by approximately basis points for funds provided under the abs facility  calculated as the specified pooled commercial paper rate  as defined in the abs facility  plus a fixed margin the cp margin 
however  beginning on july  the reset date  the cp margin may increase but in no event exceed based on percentage changes in high yield spreads comparing average index rates for the calendar month prior to the reset date against average index rates for the corresponding calendar month in the previous year 
finally  the amendment provides that  under certain circumstances  the company may be required to obtain a public rating of the abs facility from one or more credit rating agencies of at least a or its equivalent 
failure by the company to obtain such rating would result in an amortization event under the abs facility

certain of these cash balances could and will be remitted to the us by paying down intercompany payables generated in the ordinary course of business

financing for future transactions would result in the utilization of cash  incurrence of additional debt  issuance of stock or some combination of the three 
inflation we have historically not been adversely affected by inflation  as technological advances and competition within the it industry have generally caused the prices of the products we sell to decline and product life cycles tend to be short 
this requires our growth in unit sales to exceed the decline in prices in order to increase our net sales 
we believe that most price increases could be passed on to our clients  as prices charged by us are not set by long term contracts  however  as a result of competitive pressure  there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to our clients
