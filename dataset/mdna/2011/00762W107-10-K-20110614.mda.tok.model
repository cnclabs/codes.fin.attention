item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we provide best practices research and analysis  business intelligence and software tools  and management and advisory services to approximately  organizations  including hospitals  health systems  pharmaceutical and biotech companies  health care insurers  medical device companies  colleges  universities  and other educational institutions through discrete programs 
members of each program typically are charged a fixed fee and have access to an integrated set of services that may include best practice research studies  executive education seminars  customized research briefs  web based access to the program s content database  and software tools 
our membership business model allows us to create value for our members by providing proven solutions to common and complex problems as well as quality content on a broad set of relevant issues 
our growth has been driven by strong renewal rates  ongoing addition of new memberships in our existing programs  continued new program launches  acquisition activity  and continued annual price increases 
our member institution renewal rate was   and for fiscal   and  respectively 
we believe high renewal rates are a reflection of our members recognition of the value they derive from participating in our programs 
our revenue grew in fiscal over fiscal and grew in fiscal over fiscal our contract value increased to million as of march  from march  and increased to million as of march  from march  we define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributed to all agreements in effect at a given point in time  without regard to the initial term or remaining duration of any such agreement 
as of march   memberships in of our programs were renewable at the end of their membership contract term 
contract terms for these memberships generally run one  two  or three years 
our other ten programs provide management and advisory services 
memberships in these ten programs help members accelerate the adoption of best practices profiled in our research studies and are not individually renewable 
as of march   more than of our contract value was renewable 
in each of our programs  we generally invoice and collect fees in advance of accrual revenue 
our operating costs and expenses consist of cost of services  member relations and marketing  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment expenses  and  in fiscal  the write off of capitalized software 
cost of services includes the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services  consisting of compensation for research personnel  in house faculty  software developers  and consultants  the organization and delivery of membership meetings  teleconferences  and other events  production of published materials  technology license fees  and costs of developing and supporting our web based content and business intelligence and software tools 
member relations and marketing includes the costs of acquiring new members and the costs of account management  consisting of compensation  including sales incentives  travel and entertainment expenses  training of personnel  sales and marketing materials  and associated support services 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of human resources and recruiting  finance and accounting  management information systems  facilities management  new program development  and other administrative functions 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment expense includes the cost of depreciation of our property and equipment  amortization of costs associated with the development of software and tools that are offered as part of certain of our membership programs  and amortization of acquired developed technology 
write off of capitalized software in fiscal includes the impairment charge taken to write down internally developed capitalized software balances to their current fair value 
included in our operating costs for each year presented are stock based compensation expenses and expenses representing additional payroll taxes for compensation expense as a result of the taxable income employees recognized upon the exercise of common stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units 
non gaap financial presentation this management s discussion and analysis presents supplemental measures of our performance which are derived from our consolidated financial information but which are not presented in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
these financial measures  which are considered non gaap financial measures under sec rules  are referred to as adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income  and non gaap earnings per diluted share 
see non gaap financial measures below for information about these non gaap financial measures  including our reasons for including the measures  material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures  and a reconciliation of each non gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure

net income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased to million in fiscal the decrease in net income during fiscal was primarily due to two non cash charges and acquisition related costs incurred during fiscal  partially offset by revenue growth of 
during fiscal  certain members of senior management and the board of directors voluntarily surrendered for cancellation a total of  options that had exercise prices between per share and per share 
this cancellation led to a non cash charge during the year of million 
in addition  we recognized a million non cash charge during fiscal resulting from the write off of capitalized software 
the increase in net income during fiscal was primarily attributable to increased revenue  as well as the absence of the two non cash charges in described above  and was partially offset by costs associated with the launch of new programs and an increase in the number of new sales teams 
adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased to million in fiscal the decrease in adjusted ebitda during fiscal was primarily attributable to personnel  meetings  and deliverable costs incurred to support the expansion of new programs  including southwind health partners  llc and southwind navigator  llc  which we refer together as southwind  and an increase in new product development costs  partially offset by revenue growth of 
the increase in adjusted ebitda during fiscal was primarily due to increased revenue  which was partially offset by costs associated with the launch of new programs and an increase in the number of new sales teams 
revenue 
revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased to million in fiscal our contract value increased from million as of march  to million as of march   and increased to million as of march  the increase in revenue in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to the cross selling of existing programs to existing members  the introduction and expansion of new programs  the addition of new member organizations  the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of southwind and  to a lesser degree  price increases 
the increase in revenue in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to cross selling existing programs to existing members  the introduction and expansion of new programs  the addition of new member organizations  the acquisition of concuity services  inc  or concuity  and a full fiscal year of revenue from southwind 
we offered membership programs as of march   as of march   and as of march  our membership base consisted of  member institutions as of march    member institutions as of march   and  member institutions as of march  our average contract value per member was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal and  for fiscal cost of services 
cost of services increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  cost of services was for fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal the increase of million for fiscal was primarily due to million of personnel  meetings  and deliverable costs incurred to support the expansion of new programs  including southwind  offset by reductions in technology consultant fees associated with our business intelligence and software tools  and by reductions in travel expense 
the increase of million for fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel and other deliverable costs from new programs  including the acquisitions of southwind and concuity 
member relations and marketing 
member relations and marketing expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  member relations and marketing expense in fiscal   and was   and  respectively 
the total dollar increases in member relations and marketing expense over each of the fiscal years were primarily due to increases in sales staff and related travel and other associated costs  as we had an average of   and new business development teams during fiscal   and  respectively  as well as increases in member relations personnel and related costs required to serve the expanding membership base 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expense in fiscal   and was   and  respectively 
the increase of million in general and administrative costs for fiscal was primarily due to million in transaction costs relating to the acquisitions of southwind and concuity  an accelerated stock based compensation charge of million in connection with the voluntary surrender of certain stock options as described in note  stock based compensation of our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  an increase in new product development costs  and to a lesser extent increases in information systems and finance personnel 
the increase of million in general and administrative costs for fiscal was primarily due to an increase of million increase in direct recruitment expenses  as well as million increase in our administrative overhead departments to support our growing employee base 
as of march  we had approximately  employees compared to  as of march  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment 
depreciation expense increased from million  or of revenue  in fiscal  to million  or of revenue  in fiscal  and decreased to million  or of revenue  in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to increased amortization expense from developed capitalized internal use software tools of million as well as increased depreciation expense related to the expansion of additional floors in our headquarters facility under the terms of our lease agreement 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily attributable to decreased amortization expense from developed capitalized internal use software tools following a write off of capitalized software during fiscal write off of capitalized software 
during fiscal  we recognized an impairment charge on capitalized internally developed software assets of million with no comparable expense in the prior or subsequent fiscal year 
other income  net 
other income  net decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and to million in fiscal other income  net consisted of interest income of million and a foreign exchange rate loss of million in fiscal  interest income of million and a foreign exchange rate gain of  in fiscal  and interest income of million and a foreign exchange rate gain of million in fiscal interest income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and to million in fiscal due to lower interest rates and lower average invested cash balances resulting from the acquisitions of crimson software  inc  southwind  and concuity in fiscal   and  respectively 
during fiscal   and  we recognized a foreign exchange loss of million and foreign exchange gains of  and  respectively  due to the effect of fluctuating currency rates on our receivable balances from international members 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
our effective tax rate in fiscal   and was   and  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal was due primarily to an increase in our washington  dc statutory income tax rate from to as of january  in accordance with the new e conomy transformation act of the increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal was primarily due to the effect that higher estimated net income for fiscal year  when compared to fiscal year  has on our effective rate when compared to the fixed nature of our washington dc tax credits that we receive under that act  and to a lesser degree  our lower tax exempt interest income in fiscal stock based compensation expense 
we recognized the following stock based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of income line items for stock options and rsus issued under our stock incentive plans and for shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan for the years ending march    and in thousands except per share amounts year ended march  unaudited stock based compensation expense included in costs and expenses cost of services member relations and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses income from operations net income impact on diluted earnings per share there are no stock based compensation costs capitalized as part of the cost of an asset 
stock based compensation expense by award type is below in thousands year ended march  unaudited stock based compensation by award type stock options restricted stock units employee stock purchase rights total stock based compensation included in stock based compensation for the year ended march  are pre tax charges relating to the acceleration of the remaining expense on cancelled stock option awards of approximately million recorded in cost of services  million recorded in member relations and marketing  and million recorded in general and administrative expense 
as of march   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock based compensation is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
non gaap financial measures the tables below present information for the fiscal periods indicated about our adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income  and non gaap earnings per diluted share 
we define adjusted ebitda as earnings before other income  net  which includes interest income and foreign currency losses and gains  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  amortization of acquisition related intangibles and capitalized software included in cost of services  non cash charges associated with the write off of capitalized software and the cancellation of certain stock options that occurred in the quarter ended september   costs associated with the acquisitions of concuity and cielo medsolutions llc  or cielo  that occurred in the quarters ended march  and  respectively  share based compensation expense  and fair value adjustments made to our acquisition related earn out liabilities 
we define adjusted net income as net income excluding the net of tax effect of non cash charges associated with the write off of capitalized software and the cancellation of certain stock options  share based compensation expense  amortization of acquisition related intangibles  costs associated with the acquisitions of concuity and cielo  and fair value adjustments made to our acquisition related earn out liabilities 
we define non gaap earnings per diluted share as net income per share excluding the net of tax effect of non cash charges associated with the write off of capitalized software and the cancellation of certain stock options  share based compensation expense  amortization of acquisition related intangibles  costs associated with the acquisitions of concuity and cielo  and fair value adjustments made to our acquisition related earn out liabilities 
we believe that providing information about adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income  and non gaap earnings per diluted share is useful to our investors 
our management uses these non gaap financial measures  together with financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap  to enhance its understanding of our core operating performance  which represents our views concerning our performance in the ordinary  ongoing  and customary course of our operations 
in the future  we expect to report again these non gaap financial measures excluding the items discussed above and may incur expenses similar to the excluded items discussed above 
accordingly  the exclusion of these and similar items in our non gaap presentation should not be interpreted as implying that the items are non recurring  infrequent  or unusual 
our management believes that for the reasons discussed below  our use of supplemental financial measures which exclude certain expenses facilitates an assessment by management and our investors of the company s fundamental operating trends and addresses concerns of management and investors that these expenses may obscure such underlying trends 
management uses the financial measures for internal budgeting and other managerial purposes because the measures enable management to evaluate projected operating results and make comparative assessments of our performance over time while isolating the effects of certain items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance  such as tax rates  interest income and foreign currency exchange rates  periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets  share based compensation expense  and certain non cash and special charges 
the effects of the foregoing items also vary widely among similar companies  and affect the ability of management and investors to make company to company comparisons 
in addition  merger and acquisition activity can have inconsistent effects on earnings that are not related to core operating performance  for example due to charges relating to acquisition costs  the amortization of acquisition related intangibles  and fluctuations in the fair value of contingent earn out liabilities 
companies also exhibit significant variations with respect to capital structure and cost of capital which affect relative interest expense and differences in taxation and book depreciation of facilities and equipment which affect relative depreciation expense  including significant differences in the depreciable lives of similar assets among various companies 
by eliminating some of the foregoing variations  management believes that the company s non gaap financial measures allow management and investors to evaluate more effectively the company s performance relative to that of its competitors and peer companies 
similarly  our management believes that because of the variety of equity awards used by companies  the varying methodologies for determining both share based compensation and share based compensation expense among companies and from period to period  and the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations  excluding share based compensation from our non gaap financial measures enhances company to company comparisons over multiple fiscal periods 
management believes that providing non gaap information permits analysts  investors  and other interested persons to obtain a better understanding of our core operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure that performance on a standalone and a comparative basis 
as a result  we intend to continue to provide these non gaap financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions  and the inclusion of such measures in our periodic reports will provide consistency in our financial reporting 
there are limitations associated with the non gaap financial measures we use as indicators of performance  including the following the non gaap financial measures do not reflect capital expenditures and future requirements for capital expenditures  the non gaap financial measures generally do not reflect depreciation and amortization  which are non cash charges  although the assets being depreciated and amortized will in some cases have to be replaced in the future  nor do the measures reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  the non gaap financial measures do not reflect the expense of equity awards to employees  the non gaap financial measures do not reflect the effect of earnings or charges resulting from matters that management considers not indicative of our ongoing operations  but which may recur  and to the extent that we change our accounting for certain transactions or other items from period to period  our non gaap financial measures may not be directly comparable from period to period 
our non gaap measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures used by other companies  which limits their usefulness as comparative measures 
our management compensates for these limitations by using the non gaap financial measures only as a supplemental measure of our operating performance and by considering independently the economic effects of the foregoing items that are or are not reflected in the measures 
as a result of the foregoing limitations  our non gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap  but should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  gaap measures or results as indicators of performance 
a reconciliation of our non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures is provided below in thousands

we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balances and operating cash flows will be sufficient to support operating and capital expenditures  as well as share repurchases and potential acquisitions  during at least the next months 
we had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balances of million and million as of march  and  respectively 
we expended million and million in cash to purchase shares of our common stock through our share repurchase program during fiscal and  respectively 
we have no long term indebtedness 
cash flows from operating activities 
the combination of revenue growth  profitable operations  and payment for memberships in advance of accrual revenue typically results in operating activities that generate cash flows in excess of net income on an annual basis 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to acceleration in contract value and deferred revenue growth  as well as the impact of the write off of capitalized software of million and the million non cash charge associated with the cancellation of certain stock options 
the increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to the increase in net income and deferred revenue  partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of employee stock options 
cash flows from investing activities 
our cash management and investment strategy and capital expenditure programs affect investing cash flows 
net cash flows provided by investing activities were million in fiscal net cash flows used in investing activities were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  investing activities provided million in cash  primarily from the net proceeds on the redemption of marketable securities of million  which was primarily used to fund our share repurchase program and our acquisition of crimson for million  net of cash received  and capital expenditures of million  which included million in purchases of property and equipment related primarily to the scheduled expansion of our headquarters facility and million of capitalized software development costs related to our newer research programs that include web based business intelligence tools 
in fiscal  investing activities used million in cash  primarily consisting of million used in our acquisition of southwind and the related escrow  a million investment  and capital expenditures of million  partially offset by the net proceeds on the redemption and sales of marketable securities of million 
in fiscal  investing activities used million in cash  primarily consisting of million used in our acquisitions of concuity and cielo  million used on the net purchases marketable securities  and capital expenditures of million 
cash flows from financing activities 
we used net cash flows in financing activities of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
we had net cash flows provided by financing activities of million in fiscal in fiscal we used net cash flows in financing activities of million 
of this amount  we applied approximately million to repurchase  shares of our common stock and million to satisfy minimum employee tax withholding for vested restricted stock units 
the effects of these transactions were offset in part by our receipt of million from the exercise of stock options and million from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal we used net cash flows in financing activities of million  consisting of repurchasing  shares of our common stock for approximately million and million withheld to satisfy minimum employee tax withholding for vested restricted stock units  offset by million from the exercise of stock options and million from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal we had net cash flows provided by financing activities of million  consisting of million from the exercise of stock options  million from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan  and million in excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of employee options  offset by our repurchase of  shares of our common stock for approximately million and our use of million to satisfy minimum employee tax withholding for vested restricted stock units 
credit facilities 
in november  we entered into a million revolving credit facility with a commercial bank that can be used for working capital  share repurchases  or other general corporate purposes 
borrowings on the credit facility  if any  will be collateralized by certain of our marketable securities and will bear interest at an amount based on the published libor rate 
we are also required to maintain an interest coverage ratio for each fiscal year of not less than three to one 
the credit facility renews automatically each year until october   and can be increased at our request by up to an additional million per year 
we have not requested any increases in the credit facility and there have been no borrowings under the facility 
the availability of borrowings under the credit facility was million as of march  contractual obligations 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of march  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
these obligations relate to obligations under our headquarters and other offices leases as well as purchase obligations for software development services  both of which are more fully described in note  commitments and contingencies  of our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
payments due by period in thousands total yrs non cancelable operating leases purchase obligations share repurchase in january  our board of directors authorized the repurchase by us from time to time of up to million of our common stock 
this authorization was increased in cumulative amount to million in october  to million in february  to million in january  to million in july   and to million in april we intend to fund any future share repurchases with cash on hand and with cash generated from operations 
no minimum number of shares for repurchase has been fixed  and the share repurchase authorization has no expiration date 
all repurchases have been made in the open market pursuant to this publicly announced repurchase program 
as of march   the remaining authorized repurchase amount was million 
exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan options granted to participants under our stock based incentive compensation plans that were exercised to acquire shares in fiscal   and generated cash of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  from payment of option exercise prices 
in addition  in fiscal   and we generated cash of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  in discounted stock purchases by participants under our employee stock purchase plan 
off balance sheet arrangements as of march   we had no off balance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities established for purposes of facilitating off balance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually limited purposes 
summary of critical accounting policies we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and may require the application of significant judgment by our management 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our members  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note  summary of significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  services have been rendered and payment has been contractually earned  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
fees are generally billable when a letter of agreement is signed by the member  and fees receivable during the subsequent twelve month period and related deferred revenue are recorded upon the commencement of the agreement or collection of fees  if earlier 
in many of our higher priced programs and membership agreements with terms that are greater than one year  fees may be billed on an installment basis 
members whose membership agreements are subject to the service guarantee may request a refund of their fees  which is provided on a pro rata basis relative to the length of the service period 
revenue from renewable memberships is recognized ratably over the term of the related subscription agreement 
certain membership programs incorporate hosted business intelligence and software tools 
in many of these agreements  members are charged set up fees in addition to subscription fees for access to the hosted web based business intelligence tools and related membership services 
both set up fees and subscription fees are recognized ratably over the term of the membership agreement  which is generally one to three years 
upon launch of a new program that incorporates a business intelligence software tool  all program revenue is deferred until the tool is generally available for release to our membership  and then recognized ratably over the remainder of the contract term of each agreement 
one of our programs includes delivered software tools together with implementation services  technical support  and related membership services 
for these arrangements  we separate the fair value of the technical support and related membership services from the total value of the contract based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
the fees related to the software license and implementation services are bundled and recognized as services are performed using project hours as the basis to measure progress towards completion 
fees associated with the technical support and related membership services are recorded as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement  beginning when all other elements have been delivered 
multiple contracts with a single member are treated as separate arrangements for revenue recognition purposes 
we also perform professional services sold under separate agreements that include management and consulting services 
we recognize professional services revenues on a time and materials basis as services are rendered 
allowance for uncollectible revenue our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our members has an effect on our operating performance and cash flows 
we maintain an allowance for uncollectible revenue as a reduction of revenue based on our ongoing monitoring of members credit and the aging of receivables 
to determine the allowance for uncollectible revenue  we examine our collections history  the age of accounts receivable in question  any specific member collection issues that have been identified  general market conditions  and current economic trends 
property and equipment property and equipment consists of leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures  equipment  capitalized internal software development costs  and acquired developed technology 
property and equipment is stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
in certain membership programs  we provide software tools under a hosting arrangement where the software application resides on our service providers hardware 
the members do not take delivery of the software and only receive access to the business intelligence and software tools during the term of their membership agreement 
computer software development costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred 
during the development stage direct consulting costs and payroll and payroll related costs for employees that are directly associated with each project are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software once placed into operation 
capitalized software is amortized using the straight line method over its estimated useful life  which is generally five years 
replacements and major improvements are capitalized  while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
the acquired developed technology is classified as property and equipment because the developed software application resides on our service providers hardware 
amortization for acquired developed software is included in the depreciation and amortization of property and equipment line item of our consolidated statements of income 
acquired developed software is amortized over its estimated useful life of nine years based on the cash flow estimate used to determine the value of the intangible asset 
furniture  fixtures  and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from three to seven years 
leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term 
business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
all of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date 
all subsequent changes to a valuation allowance or uncertain tax position that relate to the acquired company and existed at the acquisition date that occur both within the measurement period and as a result of facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date are recognized as an adjustment to goodwill 
all other changes in valuation allowance are recognized as a reduction or increase to expense or as a direct adjustment to additional paid in capital as required 
we capitalize any acquired in process research and development as an intangible asset and amortize it over its estimated useful life 
as a result of our adoption of the revised accounting guidance for business combinations as of the beginning of fiscal  acquisition related costs are now recorded as expenses in our consolidated financial statements that would previously have been capitalized as a part of the purchase price pursuant to previous accounting rules 
goodwill and other intangible assets the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but rather tested for impairment on an annual basis on march  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment 
we have concluded that our reporting units that we use to assess goodwill impairment are the same as our operating segments 
we assess goodwill for impairment using a two step impairment test 
step one of the test is used to identify whether or not an impairment may exist 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the income approach 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an impairment may exist 
if it is determined that an impairment may exist  step two of the impairment test must then be performed to measure the amount of the impairment  if any 
the second step determines the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  discount rates and future economic and market conditions 
our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
these valuations require the use of management s assumptions  which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 
other intangible assets consist of capitalized software for sale and acquired intangibles 
we capitalize consulting costs and payroll and payroll related costs for employees directly related to building a software product once technological feasibility is established 
we determine that technological feasibility is established by the completion of a detail program design or  in its absence  completion of a working model 
once the software product is ready for general availability  we cease capitalizing costs and begin amortizing the intangible asset on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
the weighted average estimated useful life of capitalized software is five years 
other intangible assets include those assets that arise from business combinations consisting of developed technology  non competes  trademarks  contracts  and customer relationships that are amortized  on a straight line basis  over six months to ten years 
finite lived intangible assets are required to be amortized over their useful lives and are evaluated for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
recovery of long lived assets excluding goodwill we record our long lived assets  such as property and equipment  at cost 
we review the carrying value of our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable 
the test for recoverability is made using an estimate of the undiscounted expected future cash flows and  if required  the impairment loss  if any  is measured as the amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the asset s fair value if the asset is not recoverable 
we consider expected cash flows and estimated future operating results  trends  and other available information in assessing whether the carrying value of assets is impaired 
if we determine that an asset s carrying value is impaired  we will record a write down of the carrying value of the identified asset and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period in which the determination is made 
although we believe that the carrying values of our long lived assets are appropriately stated  changes in strategy or market conditions or significant technological developments could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
deferred incentive compensation and other charges direct incentive compensation to our employees related to the negotiation of new and renewal memberships  license fees to third party vendors for tools  data  and software incorporated in specific memberships that include business intelligence tools  and other direct and incremental costs associated with specific memberships are deferred and amortized over the term of the related memberships 
income taxes deferred income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method 
under this method  temporary differences arise as a result of the difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax law and tax rates on the date of the enactment of the change 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize stock based compensation cost based on the estimated fair values of the stock based awards on the grant date 
stock based compensation costs are recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of income over the vesting periods of the awards 
we calculate the grant date estimated fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
determining the estimated fair value of stock based awards is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including the term of the stock based awards  risk free interest rates over the vesting period  expected dividend rates  the price volatility of our shares  and forfeiture rates of the awards 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and adjusted  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the forfeiture rate is based on historical experience 
our fair value estimates are based on assumptions we believe are reasonable but that are inherently uncertain 
the fair value of restricted stock units is determined as the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
we also report the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense as a financing cash inflow in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
to the extent we change the terms of our employee stock based compensation programs  experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increases the implied volatility calculation  or refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our current estimates  among other potential factors  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  which is designed for safety of principal and liquidity 
cash and cash equivalents include investments in highly liquid us treasury obligations with maturities of less than three months 
as of march   our marketable securities consisted of million in tax exempt notes and bonds issued by various states  and million in us government agency securities 
the weighted average maturity on all our marketable securities as of march  was approximately years 
we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit ratings related to our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
our portfolio is subject to inherent interest rate risk as investments mature and are reinvested at current market interest rates 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our portfolio risk or income profile 
due to the nature of our investments we have not prepared quantitative disclosure for interest rate sensitivity in accordance with item of the sec s regulation s k as we believe the effect of interest rate fluctuations would not be material 
foreign currency risk 
although they accounted for approximately of our fiscal revenue  our international operations subject us to risks related to currency exchange fluctuations 
prices for our services sold to members located outside the united states are sometimes denominated in local currencies primarily british pound sterling 
as a consequence  increases in the us dollar against local currencies in countries where we have members would result in a foreign exchange loss recognized by us 
in fiscal   and  we recorded foreign currency exchange losses or gains of million   and  respectively  which are included in other income  net in our consolidated statements of income 
a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial position as of march
