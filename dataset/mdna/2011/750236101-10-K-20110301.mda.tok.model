table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item and the risk factors detailed in item a of part i of this report 
business summary overview we are a credit enhancement company with a primary strategic focus on domestic  first lien residential mortgage insurance 
our business segments are mortgage insurance  financial guaranty and financial services 
mortgage insurance our mortgage insurance segment provides credit related insurance coverage  principally through private mortgage insurance  and risk management services to mortgage lending institutions 
we have provided these products and services mainly through our wholly owned subsidiaries  radian guaranty inc  amerin guaranty corporation  and radian insurance inc which we refer to as radian guaranty  amerin guaranty  and radian insurance  respectively 
private mortgage insurance protects mortgage lenders from all or a portion of default related losses on residential mortgage loans made to home buyers who generally make down payments of less than of the home s purchase price 
private mortgage insurance also facilitates the sale of these mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market  most of which are sold to freddie mac and federal national mortgage association fannie mae 
we refer to freddie mac and fannie mae together as government sponsored enterprises or gses 
traditional mortgage insurance 
our mortgage insurance segment  through radian guaranty  offers primary mortgage insurance coverage on residential first lien mortgages first lien 
at december   primary insurance on first liens made up approximately of our total first lien mortgage insurance risk in force 
we also offer pool insurance on first liens on a limited basis 
pool insurance comprised approximately of our total first lien mortgage insurance risk in force at december  non traditional mortgage credit enhancement 
in addition to traditional mortgage insurance  in the past  we used radian insurance and amerin guaranty to provide other forms of credit enhancement on residential mortgage assets 
these products include mortgage insurance on second lien mortgages second lien  credit enhancement on net interest margin securities nims  credit default swaps cds on domestic and international mortgages  and primary mortgage insurance on international mortgages collectively  we refer to the risk associated with these transactions as non traditional or other risk 
we stopped writing all non traditional business in  other than a small amount of international mortgage insurance  which we discontinued writing in financial guaranty our financial guaranty segment has mainly provided direct insurance and reinsurance on credit based risks through radian asset assurance inc radian asset assurance  a wholly owned subsidiary of radian guaranty 
in the past  we also wrote financial guaranty business internationally through radian asset assurance limited raal  an insurance company licensed in the united kingdom and a subsidiary of radian asset assurance 
all of our exposure written through raal has been novated to radian asset assurance or commuted  and we placed raal into liquidation in we expect the liquidation of raal to be completed during financial guaranty insurance typically provides an unconditional and irrevocable guaranty to the holder of a financial obligation of full and timely payment of principal and interest when due 
financial guaranty insurance may be issued at the inception of an insured obligation or may be issued for the benefit of a holder of an 
table of contents obligation in the secondary market 
historically  financial guaranty insurance has been used to lower an issuer s cost of borrowing when the insurance premium is less than the value of the spread commonly referred to as the credit spread between the market yield required to be paid on the insured obligation carrying the credit rating of the insurer and the market yield required to be paid on the obligation if sold on the basis of its uninsured credit rating 
financial guaranty insurance also has been used to increase the marketability of obligations issued by infrequent or unknown issuers or obligations with complex structures 
traditionally  investors have benefited from financial guaranty insurance through increased liquidity in the secondary market  reduced exposure to price volatility caused by changes in the credit quality of the underlying insured issue  and added protection against loss in the event of the obligor s default on its obligation 
market developments  including ratings downgrades of most financial guaranty insurance companies including radian asset assurance  have significantly reduced the benefits of financial guaranty insurance  particularly certain forms of financial guaranty structured finance transactions 
we have provided direct financial guaranty credit protection either through the issuance of a financial guaranty insurance policy or a cds 
both forms of credit enhancement provide the purchaser of such credit protection with a guaranty of the timely payment of interest and scheduled principal when due on a covered financial obligation 
by providing protection through cds  we were able to participate in transactions involving asset classes such as corporate collateralized debt obligations cdos that may not have been available to us through the issuance of a traditional financial guaranty insurance policy 
either form of credit enhancement requires similar underwriting and surveillance 
we have historically offered the following financial guaranty products public finance insurance of public finance obligations  including tax exempt and taxable indebtedness of states  counties  cities  special service districts  other political subdivisions  enterprises such as public and private higher education institutions and health care facilities and infrastructure  project finance and private finance initiative assets in sectors such as airports  education  healthcare and other infrastructure projects  structured finance insurance of structured finance obligations  including cdos and asset backed securities abs  consisting of funded and non funded referred to herein as synthetic executions that are payable from or tied to the performance of a specific pool of assets or covered reference entities 
examples of the pools of assets that collateralize or underlie structured finance obligations include corporate loans  bonds or other borrowed money  residential and commercial mortgages  trust preferred securities trups  diversified payment rights dpr  a variety of consumer loans  equipment receivables  real and personal property leases  or a combination of asset classes  or securities backed by one or more of these pools of assets 
we have also guaranteed excess clearing losses of securities exchange clearinghouses  reinsurance reinsurance of domestic and international public finance obligations  including those issued by sovereign and sub sovereign entities  and structured finance obligations 
in  in light of market conditions and the downgrade of the financial strength ratings of our financial guaranty insurance subsidiaries  we discontinued writing any new financial guaranty business  including accepting new financial guaranty reinsurance  other than as necessary to commute  restructure  hedge or otherwise mitigate losses or reduce exposure in our existing portfolio 
following this decision  we reduced our financial guaranty operations  including a significant reduction in our financial guaranty workforce 
since  we have also reduced our financial guaranty exposures through commutations in order to eliminate uncertainty  maximize the ultimate capital available for our mortgage insurance business and accelerate the potential access to that capital 
we continue to explore ways to maximize the value of our existing insured financial guaranty portfolio  including the possibility of partnering with third parties to utilize all or a portion of the portfolio as a platform for writing new public finance and infrastructure business  as well as other possible ways to leverage the portfolio 
on february   radian asset assurance signed an agreement to purchase municipal and infrastructure 
table of contents assurance corporation the fg insurance shell  a new york domiciled financial guaranty insurance company that has not written any business  but has obtained licenses to do so in states and the district of columbia 
the acquisition  which remains subject to regulatory approval  provides radian asset assurance with the flexibility to consider using the fg insurance shell to pursue strategic alternatives in the public finance market  including possibly partnering with third party investors to write new public finance insurance and or reinsuring all or a portion of radian asset assurance s existing public finance business 
we are in the early stages of exploring these potential uses  and expect that any new initiative for the fg insurance shell would be consistent with our ultimate goal of reducing our financial guaranty exposure 
the expected purchase price of approximately million is million above the value of the statutory capital base of the fg insurance shell  consisting of approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and treasury securities 
financial guaranty exposure subject to recapture or termination 
as a result of multiple ratings downgrades of radian asset assurance  approximately billion of our total net par outstanding as of december  representing of financial guaranty s total net par outstanding  remains subject to recapture or termination at the option of our primary reinsurance customers and credit derivative counterparties 
if all of our direct insurance that is subject to termination was terminated as of december   our net par outstanding would have been reduced by billion  with a corresponding decrease in unearned premium reserves of million and a decrease in the present value of expected future installment premiums of million 
net unrealized losses on derivatives and vies of million would also have been reversed had these transactions been terminated as of december  if any of our derivative transactions were terminated by our credit derivative counterparties  such terminations would not have resulted in a payment by either party 
if all of our reinsurance that is subject to recapture was recaptured as of december   our net par outstanding would have been reduced by billion and the pre tax impact on our financial statements would have been as follows statement of operations in millions decrease in assumed premiums written decrease in net premiums earned increase in change in fair value of derivative instruments gain decrease in policy acquisition costs decrease in provision for losses increase in pre tax income balance sheet in millions decrease in cash deferred policy acquisition costs accounts and notes receivable derivative assets unearned premiums reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses lae derivative liabilities assuming all of this reinsurance business was recaptured as of december   radian asset assurance s statutory surplus would have increased by approximately million  primarily as a result of the release of contingency reserves 
the net present value of installment premiums on derivative contracts would have decreased by million 

table of contents while our treaties with our primary reinsurance customers do not permit our reinsurance customers to selectively recapture business previously ceded to us under their treaties  because we have entered into multiple treaties with each customer  it is possible that a customer may choose to recapture business only under those treaties that it perceives as covering less risky portions of our reinsurance portfolio 
this selective recapture  if it occurs  could potentially leave us with risk that is more concentrated in troubled asset classes 
financial services at december   our financial services segment consisted solely of our interest in credit based asset servicing and securitization llc c bass  a mortgage investment company that we wrote off completely in  and that filed for chapter bankruptcy protection on november  historically  c bass operated as a mortgage investment and servicing company specializing in the credit risk of subprime single family residential mortgages 
as a result of the disruption in the subprime mortgage market during  c bass ceased purchasing mortgages and mortgage securities and its securitization activities in the third quarter of and sold its loan servicing platform in the fourth quarter of we recorded a full write off of our equity interest in c bass in the third quarter of and wrote off a million credit facility with c bass in the fourth quarter of as a consequence of the complete write off of our investment in c bass in  we have no continuing interest of value in c bass 
the effect of c bass on our financial position and results of operations as of and for the years ended december   and  was negligible 
we have no contractual obligations to c bass or its creditors to fund c bass s shareholders deficit or any other of its obligations 
the likelihood that we will recover any of our investment is extremely remote 
accordingly  we believe it is extremely unlikely that our investment in c bass will have anything more than a negligible impact on our financial position  results of operation or cash flows at any time in the future 
on may   radian guaranty sold to sherman financial group llc sherman  a consumer asset and servicing firm specializing in charged off and bankruptcy plan consumer assets  all of its remaining equity interest in sherman for approximately million in cash  pursuant to a securities purchase agreement the sherman purchase agreement dated as of may   between radian guaranty and sherman 
as a result of the sale  in the second quarter of  we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million  net of transaction related expenses of million  and a pre tax decrease in accumulated comprehensive income of million 
in addition  under the sherman purchase agreement  we agreed to terminate certain rights  including our right to a future contingent payment from a previous sale of our interest in sherman 
overview of business results as a seller of credit protection  our results are subject to macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the production environment and credit performance of our underlying insured assets 
while the improved credit quality of new mortgage insurance business writings continued in  the ongoing downturn in the housing and related credit markets  characterized by a decrease in mortgage originations  decline in home prices in certain markets  deteriorating credit performance of mortgage and other assets and reduced liquidity for many participants in the mortgage and financial services industries  has had  and we believe will continue to have  a significant negative impact on the operating environment and results of operations for each of our businesses 
there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding our ultimate loss performance 
the possibility that the united states us economy may not recover from the most recent recession or may reenter a recessionary period following a brief period of stabilization or growth  the lack of meaningful liquidity in some sectors of the capital and credit markets  the potential for continued high unemployment and limited home price appreciation or further depreciation may add further stress on the performance of our insured assets 

table of contents mortgage insurance defaults 
our first lien primary default rate at december  was  compared to at december  our primary default inventory decreased by during despite this positive trend  which is primarily the result of a decrease in new defaults  an increase in the curing of defaults cures and an increase in claims paid  our overall primary default rates continue to remain elevated due to high unemployment and continued weakness in the us housing and mortgage credit markets 
defaults have remained at elevated levels across all our mortgage insurance product lines  including our insured portfolio of prime  first lien mortgages 
in addition  a slowdown in mortgage foreclosures  and consequently a slowdown in claims submitted to us  has contributed to the sustained high level of our default inventory  mainly due to the foreclosure moratoriums imposed by various government entities and lenders  and due to prolonged modification programs for certain delinquent loans 
this has resulted in more defaults remaining unresolved for a longer period than has historically been the case 
this slowdown in claims is further exacerbated by foreclosure moratoriums imposed by certain servicers that are related to allegations that servicers and other third parties acted improperly in foreclosure proceedings 
see risk factors foreclosure moratoriums may extend the period of time that a loan remains in our delinquent loan inventory and increase the severity of claims we are required to pay once the moratoriums expire 
overall  the underlying trend of high defaults continues to be primarily driven by the poor performance of our through books of business 
we believe that a return to sustained profitability in our mortgage insurance business is largely dependent upon a significant further reduction in the number of new primary  first lien defaults 
while we expect new primary  first lien defaults to continue to decrease throughout and in future years  based on the current pace of this decrease  we do not expect our mortgage insurance business to be profitable in provision for losses 
our mortgage insurance provision for losses was  million for our loss provision for was positively impacted by a decrease in new default notices received during compared to this impact was offset  however  by an increase in the rate at which defaults move to claim default to claim rate  an increase in the expected payment amount severity of expected pool insurance claims and the breach of subordination levels for certain pool insurance structured transactions in which we are in a second loss position 
the severity of pool insurance claims has increased significantly in  and is reflected by first lien reserves per pool default increasing to  per pool loan at december   from  at december  see risk factors a large portion of our mortgage insurance risk in force consists of higher risk loans  such as high ltv and non prime loans  as well as pool mortgage insurance 
while there has been continued slowing in the rate at which later stage defaults become submitted claims  the estimated default to claim rate increased slightly during  mainly due to the aging of our default inventory and a decrease in our estimate of future insurance rescission and claim denials 
our mortgage insurance reserve for losses continues to be positively impacted by our loss management efforts 
our loss reserve estimate incorporates our recent experience with respect to the number of claims that we are denying and the number of insurance certificates that we are rescinding due to fraud  underwriters negligence or other factors 
our current level of rescissions and denials is significantly higher than historical levels  which we believe reflects the larger concentration of poorly underwritten loans primarily originated during through that are in our default inventory  as well as our efforts to examine more claims 
we expect the level of rescissions and denials to continue to remain elevated from historical levels as long as our through insurance policies comprise the majority of our default inventory 
see risk factors insurance rescissions and claim denials may not continue at the levels we have recently experienced and an increasing number of our lender customers are challenging our insurance rescissions and claim denials 
claims paid 
total mortgage insurance claims paid in were  million 
claims paid for included a net reduction of million related to the net impact of recoveries from the termination of captive reinsurance transactions and payments made in connection with the termination 
table of contents of certain first and second lien structured transactions see below 
foreclosure moratoriums and loan modification programs aimed at mitigating the housing downturn have reduced the number of defaults going to claim 
we cannot be certain of the ultimate impact of these programs on our business  results of operations  or the timing of this impact 
some of the foreclosure moratoriums related to foreclosure documentation may further delay our receipt of claims 
in  we expect to pay total claims  including first and second liens  of approximately billion  although foreclosure moratoriums and the reduction in claims received contribute further uncertainty to this estimate 
new insurance written 
we wrote billion of primary mortgage insurance during  representing a decrease of compared to primary mortgage insurance written in this decrease is mainly the result of an overall smaller mortgage market  increased competition from the federal housing administration fha  which is currently insuring of the total insured mortgage market significantly more than before the recent economic downturn  our more restrictive underwriting guidelines and the limited secondary market for mortgage securitizations other than the gses 
we have been more aggressively marketing our product offerings that favorably compete with the fha prices in order to gain market share back from the fha 
while the private mortgage insurance industry has made some progress in recapturing business from the fha in  including as a result of the fha s raising pricing in  the fha s market share remains historically high  and this competition  in conjunction with the other factors identified above  is likely to continue to negatively affect the volume of our new insurance written 
starting in  we implemented a series of changes to our underwriting guidelines aimed at improving the long term risk profile and profitability of our business 
as a result of these changes  the credit profile of our mortgage insurance portfolio has improved 
for and  almost all of our new business production was categorized as prime business 
in addition  fair isaac and company fico scores for the borrowers of these insured mortgages have increased  while the loan to value ltv on these mortgage loans has decreased  meaning that borrowers generally are making larger down payments in connection with the more recent mortgage loans that we are insuring 
terminations 
in  we began pursuing opportunities to reduce our legacy mortgage insurance portfolio and non traditional mortgage insurance risk in force 
we executed upon this strategy through a series of commutations  transaction settlements and terminations  including the following notable transactions during in january  we settled with a counterparty on approximately million of second lien risk in force for a payment of million 
we recorded a reduction in our reserve for losses in the fourth quarter of related to this termination payment 
there was no impact on our pre tax income as a result of this termination 
in the first quarter  we paid million to terminate certain structured transactions  comprising million of modified pool risk in force 
because the existing aggregate loss reserves for these transactions were million  these terminations resulted in approximately million of pre tax income 
these transactions had the effect of reducing our primary insurance in force by billion  and reduced our primary default count by  loans 
in the third quarter  we paid million to terminate two structured transactions  consisting of million of first lien risk in force 
because the existing aggregate loss reserves for these transactions were million  these terminations resulted in approximately million of pre tax income 
these transactions had the effect of reducing our primary insurance in force by billion  and reduced our primary default count by  loans 
during the year  in order to mitigate future expected losses  we purchased approximately million face value of our insured nims bonds at a purchase price of million  which approximated the recorded fair value liability for these transactions at the date of purchase 
as such  the termination had a negligible impact on our results of operations in 
table of contents financial guaranty net par outstanding 
our financial guaranty net par outstanding was billion as of december   compared to billion at december  the reduction in net par outstanding was primarily due to counterparties exercising their early termination rights  prepayments refundings of public finance transactions  negotiated settlements of certain cdos  a commutation of reinsurance exposure and the amortization or scheduled maturity of our insured portfolio 
in light of our decision in to discontinue writing new financial guaranty business  we expect our net par outstanding to continue to decrease as our financial guaranty portfolio matures and as we seek to proactively reduce our financial guaranty risk in force 
credit performance 
while we experienced improvement in our claims paid and provision for losses in compared to  there continues to be deterioration in the internal ratings of certain portions of our insured portfolio 
the percentage of credits internally rated below investment grade big increased to of our net par outstanding at december  from at december   while the percentage of internally rated aaa credits in our portfolio increased to of our net par outstanding at december  from at december  the increase in the percentage of big credits was primarily due to credit deterioration in the second to pay collateralized loan obligations clo  one project finance credit and  to a lesser extent  the alternative a alt a residential mortgage backed securities rmbs segments of our insured portfolio 
public finance 
our public finance insured portfolio continues to experience stress from the general economic downturn  with the greatest level of stress continuing in the healthcare and long term care sectors 
although we have seen some stabilization and modest improvement in the performance of some healthcare credits in the portfolio  the outlook for credit performance for the healthcare sector remains challenging  particularly due to uncertainty regarding the future of healthcare reform and state and federal funding for healthcare expenditures 
we have observed an increase in refundings of our public finance exposure in in particular within our investment grade healthcare and long term care sectors  however  we do not expect the same level of refundings in as a result of the expiration of certain laws that provided issuers with incentives to refinance and anticipated increases in interest rates that issuers will be required to pay in future offerings 
we may experience future credit deterioration and municipal defaults in our government related insured credits  as the difficulties experienced by government entities to maintain balanced budgets and adequate liquidity to meet near term financial obligations continue to strain municipalities and their public authorities 
to date  the states and municipalities included within our government related insured credits have generally been able to withstand this stress 
as of december   of our insured public finance portfolio was rated investment grade at least bbb internally  compared to as of december  the small decline in the percentage of our public finance portfolio rated investment grade was primarily due to a downgrade of one transaction within our project finance sector 
structured finance 
we saw signs of credit improvement in our structured finance portfolio in we experienced significantly fewer defaults in the collateral underlying our corporate cdos in three in  compared to in 
while the subordination and interest coverage ratio levels in many of our insured trups cdos were further reduced in  we also began to see some stabilization and positive developments in the collateral pools of our insured trups cdos  with some issuers of trups having benefited from earnings growth and greater access to the capital markets 
the internal ratings of two directly insured trups bonds that were rated big as of december   were upgraded to bbb during  due to improved collateral performance 
see results of operations financial guaranty financial guaranty exposure information below for additional information regarding material changes in the credit performance of our insured trups cdo portfolio 
with respect to other portions of our structured finance insured portfolio  there was some credit deterioration during  primarily in our cdos of commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs transactions  and to a lesser extent  in our domestic non cdo rmbs 
we downgraded 
table of contents two of our cdos of cmbs transactions in to aa and bbb 
total average delinquencies in the cmbs collateral pools underlying our cmbs tranches increased significantly in in addition  the portion of our non cdo alt a rmbs portfolio that is big increased during  from to  and the portion of our net par outstanding to domestic non cdo rmbs that is big increased during from to results of operations our results of operations were significantly impacted by a valuation allowance of million recognized in the fourth quarter of against our deferred tax assets dta  which represented almost the entire asset balance 
the valuation allowance is primarily a result of our history of losses  including our significant loss in the fourth quarter of  and the uncertainty of our future results 
while we continue to expect a return to profitability in the long term  this turnaround remains uncertain based on macroeconomic factors such as the slower than expected pace of the economic recovery as well as the ultimate timing and magnitude of our losses 
if we return to a period of sustained profitability  as we currently expect  all or a portion of this valuation allowance would be reversed 
our results for were also negatively impacted by the change in fair value of derivative instruments  which occurred primarily as a result of our five year cds spread tightening by from december because we have the ability to hold our financial guaranty contracts to maturity  changes in market spreads are not necessarily indicative of our expected ultimate net credit loss payments with respect to these obligations 
our estimated credit loss payments presented in the table below represent our current estimate of the present value net of estimated recoveries that we expect to pay in claims with respect to our insured credit derivatives and net variable interest entity vie liabilities 
the fair value of these obligations is measured as of a specific point in time and may be influenced by changes in interest rates  credit spreads  credit ratings and other market  asset class and transaction specific conditions and factors that may be unrelated to our obligation to pay future claims 
other factors that may cause a difference between the fair value of these obligations and our estimated credit loss payments include the effects of our non performance risk and differing assumptions regarding discount rate and future performance 
in the absence of credit losses  unrealized losses related to changes in fair value will reverse before or at the maturity of these obligations 
however  we may agree to settle some or all of these obligations prior to maturity at amounts that are greater or less than their fair values at the time of settlement  which could result in the realization of gains or losses and the reversal of unrealized gains or losses

net investment income 
the decrease in net investment income during  compared to  is primarily due to lower yields in our investment portfolio as a result of a continued reallocation of the investment portfolio to shorter term investments in anticipation of increasing claim payments in our mortgage insurance segment 
in addition  assets were also reallocated from longer duration  higher yielding tax exempt municipal securities to taxable securities of intermediate duration with lower interest rates

also negatively impacting the results for  were losses related to nims vie debt 
the losses on our vie debt were primarily caused by a tightening in radian group s cds spread during the year  which had the effect of increasing the fair value liabilities of our vies 
our cds spreads also tightened during partially offsetting these losses in were realized gains on investments  with the majority of gains occurring as a result of sales from our trading portfolio  in connection with the strategic repositioning of our investment portfolio from tax advantaged securities to securities that provide taxable investment income  and for which we recorded unrealized gains as a result of positive market conditions

provision for premium deficiency 
we reassess our expectations for premiums  losses and expenses for our mortgage insurance business at least quarterly and record or adjust the premium deficiency reserve  as necessary  as actual losses are incurred and premiums are received

partially offsetting these improvements in was a decrease in change in fair value of derivative instruments due primarily to the prospective implementation of the accounting standard regarding fair value measurements in  for which we recorded a significant gain in net premiums written and earned 
premiums written and earned in our mortgage insurance segment decreased as a result of an industry wide decline in the amount of new mortgage insurance written  and also due to increased estimates of premium refunds associated with our expectation of increased rescissions 
premiums written and earned in our financial guaranty business decreased as a result of the commutation of billion of net par outstanding in  and also due to the fact that we discontinued writing new financial guaranty business in the second half of net investment income 
this decrease in net investment income was due to a decrease in yields on invested assets  primarily as a result of a significant reallocation of our investment portfolio to shorter term investments in anticipation of increasing claim payments in our mortgage insurance segment 
in addition  assets were reallocated from longer duration  higher yielding tax exempt municipal securities to taxable securities of intermediate duration in a lower rate environment 
change in fair value of derivative instruments 
the decrease in gain on the change in fair value of derivative instruments in resulted from the tightening of credit spreads on our insured transactions  which produced unrealized gains  partially offset by the tightening of our cds spread  which resulted in unrealized losses 
in  our cds credit spread widened  as did the credit spreads on the underlying collateral  which 
table of contents resulted in large unrealized losses  but was offset by the adoption  in  of a new accounting standard that impacted our fair valuation  as it incorporated the market s perception of non performance risk into our valuation methodology and resulted in large unrealized gains 
net gains losses on other financial instruments

table of contents other income 
the decrease in other income for as compared to  is due to a decline in contract underwriting income resulting from the overall decline in mortgage origination volume 
provision for losses 
our mortgage insurance provision for losses for increased compared to  primarily as a result of a decrease in the impact of changes in our estimated insurance rescissions and claim denials in compared to during  we significantly increased our estimate for rescissions and denials  which resulted in a lower default to claim rate used in determining our loss reserve estimate as of december   and benefited our loss reserve estimate by approximately billion in during  the impact to our loss reserve from estimated rescissions and denials declined  primarily due to the realization of actual rescissions and denials 
the following table illustrates the impact to our loss reserve estimates from estimated insurance rescissions and claim denials as of the dates indicated december in millions impact to our loss reserve of estimated rescissions and denials the following table illustrates the amount of first lien claims submitted to us for payment that were rescinded or denied for the years ended december  and  net of reinstatements within each period year ended december in millions rescissions first loss position denials first loss position total first loss position rescissions second loss position denials second loss position total second loss position total first lien claims submitted for payment that were rescinded or denied related to claims from policies in which we were in a first loss position and would have paid the claim absent the rescission or denial 
related to claims from policies in which we were in a second loss position 
these rescissions or denials may not have resulted in a claim payment obligation due to deductibles and other exposure limitations included in our policies 
includes a small amount of submitted claims that were subsequently withdrawn by the insured 
we received fewer notices of new defaults during  which positively impacted our provision for losses in compared to also in  our provision for losses increased due to an aging of our default inventory  an increase in primary and pool severity  and the breach of subordination levels for certain pool insurance transactions in which we are in a second loss position 
our default to claim rate assumption which is net of denials and rescissions used in estimating our provision for losses was at december   at december  and at december  our reported rescission and denial activity in any given period is subject to future challenges by our lender customers 
our reserve for defaults that we estimate had been incurred but not reported to us on a timely basis  as 
table of contents well as defaults related to previously rescinded policies and denied claims that are expected to be reinstated or resubmitted  was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in this estimate primarily reflects an increase both in recent trends and in claim denial activity in  as we expect a portion of such denied claims to be resubmitted with the required documentation and ultimately paid 
all estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments are made as they become necessary 
the following table illustrates the total amount of first lien claims submitted to us for payment that were rescinded during and  and then subsequently were challenged rebutted by the lenders and policyholders  but have not been reinstated year ended december in millions first loss position second loss position total non overturned rebuttals on rescinded first lien claims while the total potential claim amount of non overturned rebuttals represents all challenged rescissions during and for which coverage has not been reinstated  our on going  active engagement with our lender customers typically involves a small number of these non overturned rebuttals 
absent litigation or other legal proceedings in which we are not successful  we do not expect that these discussions are likely to result in settlements that would materially impact our liquidity or results of operations 
the following table shows the cumulative rescission and denial rates as of december  on our total first lien portfolio in the quarter the claims were received for the periods indicated claim received quarter cumulative rescission rate for each quarter percentage of claims resolved q q q q q q q q q q rescission rates represent the ratio of claims rescinded or denied to claims received by claim count and represent as of december  the cumulative rate for each quarter based on number of claims received during that quarter 
until all of the claims received during the periods shown have been resolved  the rescission rates for each quarter will be subject to change 
these rates are also subject to change based on reinstatements of previously rescinded policies or denied claims 
for each quarter presented in the table above  represents the number of claims that have been internally resolved as a percentage of the total number of claims received for that specific quarter 
a claim is considered internally resolved when it is either paid or we conclude that the claim should be denied or rescinded 
for the third and fourth quarters of  a significant portion of claims received for those quarters have not been internally resolved  therefore  we do not believe the cumulative rescission rates for those periods are presently meaningful

we provide additional information below regarding the performance of certain financial guaranty insurance transactions for which we anticipate that we will likely be required to make cumulative claim payments in excess of million we have provided credit protection on the senior most tranche of a cdo of abs transaction with million net par outstanding at december  the underlying collateral consists predominantly of mezzanine tranches of mortgage backed securities mbs 
as of december   million or of the underlying collateral was rated big by at least one rating agency  and million or of the underlying collateral had defaulted 
due to the substantial deterioration of the underlying collateral  we currently expect to begin paying claims related to interest shortfalls on this transaction in  and possibly earlier if the deterioration is worse than projected 
due to the structure of this transaction  we do not expect to pay claims related to principal 
table of contents shortfalls until sometime between and the legal final maturity date for the transaction in although losses for this transaction are difficult to estimate  we currently believe that our ultimate claim payments in respect of principal for this transaction will be substantially all of our total net par outstanding 
this transaction is currently rated cc internally  cc by standard poor s rating service s p and ca by moody s investor service moody s 
we are exploring loss mitigation alternatives with respect to this transaction  including the possibility of commuting our remaining risk 
we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in such loss mitigation efforts 
we have reinsured several primary financial guaranty insurers obligations with respect to million in net par outstanding as of december  related to jefferson county  alabama the county sewer bonds 
we began paying claims related to these sewer bonds in june  and have paid million of claims on this transaction as of december  the county s sewer system operations have generated sufficient revenues since the beginning of to pay interest on its outstanding debt  as well as regularly scheduled annual installments of principal in february and primarily due to historically low prevailing interest rates on the county s variable rate obligations 
however  we believe a number of factors are adversely affecting the performance of these obligations  including the county s highly leveraged capital position  the sub par performance of the sewer facilities and the possibility that the county would be unable to generate sufficient revenues to repay the bonds if interest rates were to increase 
in addition  it remains possible that the county will file for bankruptcy protection 
in september  a court appointed receiver over the sewer system was installed with the power to raise sewer rates and increase revenues  which could result in increased revenues being available to repay outstanding bonds 
this receiver has not yet announced specific plans for addressing the financial performance of the county sewer system 
there have been several public reports of settlement discussions  including a public announcement by the county in september that it has proposed a settlement with its creditors that  if approved  could eliminate nearly half of the county s billion sewer debt 
we cannot provide any assurance regarding the ability of the relevant parties to reach a settlement  or what the impact of any settlement would be on our exposure 
as of december   we had million of loss and lae reserves for this transaction 
we have provided credit protection on directly insured senior trups bonds with an aggregate net par outstanding of  million as of december  our credit protection on these senior trups bonds was provided through separate cds contracts  meaning that with respect to four of these senior trups bonds at december   we entered into two separate cds contracts each with a different counterparty covering pari passu portions of the same trups bond 
many of the issuers in our insured trups bonds have been negatively affected by the recent us economic recession 
certain of these issuers have defaulted on their obligation to pay interest on their trups bonds or have voluntarily chosen to defer interest payments  which is permissible for up to five years 
since we believe there is a significant likelihood that trups that are subject to interest deferrals will ultimately result in a default  we closely monitor deferrals  as well as defaults  in assessing the subordination remaining beneath our insured trups bonds 
nine of the trups bonds that we insure representing a net par outstanding of billion were internally rated big as of december  the weighted average internal rating for all of our directly insured trups bonds remained at b as of december  the fair value liability of our directly insured trups transactions  which are accounted for as derivatives  was million as of december  one of our insured trups bonds began experiencing interest shortfalls in october in january  we eliminated million of our exposure to this trups bond by commuting one of the cds contracts covering this bond 
our aggregate net loss with respect to such commutation approximated the fair value of this derivative liability at december  we continue to have million of net par exposure to this trups bond through the remaining cds contract 
as of december   we have paid an aggregate of million in interest shortfall claims in respect of this trups cdo bond  and we expect to continue to pay additional interest shortfall claims on this remaining cds contract 
in 
table of contents addition  we may be required to pay a liquidity claim as discussed in liquidity and capital resources financial guaranty below on this cds contract 
we are exploring loss mitigation alternatives with respect to this trups bond  including the possibility of commuting our remaining risk 
we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in such loss mitigation efforts 
based on current projections  we expect to experience ultimate net credit losses on two of our trups bonds the trups bond discussed in the preceeding paragraph and one other trups bond with an aggregate of million in net par outstanding 
based on our current cash flow projections  we believe that  in addition to interest claims that we may be required to pay over time  we will be required to pay aggregate principal claims totalling a majority of the current net par outstanding for these bonds 
it should be noted that even relatively small changes in trups default rates or economic conditions from current projections could have a material impact on the timing and amount of cash available to make principal and interest payments on the underlying trups bonds 
therefore  the occurrence  timing and duration of any event of default and the amount of any ultimate principal or interest shortfall payments are uncertain and very difficult to predict 
in addition to the transactions described above  we are monitoring developments  exploring potential alternatives and conducting additional analysis with respect to our exposure to reliance rail  a project finance transaction for the design  construction and maintenance of commuter trains for the sydney  australia suburban rail network 
as of december   we provided an aggregate of million of credit protection on the secured debt of reliance rail through reinsurance million  direct second to pay obligations million and assumed second to pay obligations million 
while most of our exposure is to reliance rail s senior secured debt  approximately million of our reinsurance exposure is to reliance rail s junior secured debt 
as of december   we have a derivative liability in the amount of million for this transaction 
due to delays in the delivery of equipment combined with structural risks  including debt due in that will likely need to be refinanced and the potential withdrawal of unfunded commitments  we downgraded our internal ratings of this obligation from investment grade to bb in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income loss 
the decrease in net income in compared to was mainly due to a decrease in the change in fair value of derivative instruments  which was driven primarily by changes in the market s perception of our non performance risk  and a decrease in net premiums earned 
offsetting these decreases  net gains on other financial instruments increased during compared to  our provision for losses decreased due mainly to the commutation of a large portfolio in and certain favorable developments in our structured finance business  and our income tax provision decreased 
net premiums earned 
net premiums earned for decreased as a result of our decision in to discontinue writing new financial guaranty business and as a result of a high level of refundings  policy expirations and commutations in both and included in net premiums earned for were refundings of million compared to million for net premiums earned in were impacted by the commutation of a large portfolio  which reduced our net par outstanding by billion and reduced net premiums earned for by million 
net investment income 
the decrease in net investment income in compared to was due to lower yields on taxable investments in our investment portfolio  as a result of the reallocation of our investment portfolio to shorter term investments 
in addition  assets were reallocated from longer duration  higher yielding tax exempt municipal securities to taxable securities of intermediate duration in a lower interest rate environment 
change in fair value of derivative instruments 
the decrease in the change in fair value of derivative instruments in compared to was due to credit spreads on our insured cdos tightening significantly  
table of contents resulting in net unrealized gains on this portfolio 
partially offsetting these gains was the effect of the tightening of our five year cds spread in and credit deterioration in our trups cdo portfolio  which resulted in an unrealized loss on our trups cdos for during  our five year cds spread widened  and we adopted a new accounting standard regarding fair value measurements  the cumulative impact of which was a significant unrealized net gain for net gains losses on other financial instruments 
net gains losses on other financial instruments increased from a loss in to a gain in during  market prices of our investments strengthened as a result of the improved domestic and global economic environment  and we made the decision to realize gains in the investment portfolio  primarily through the sale of taxable bonds  convertible securities and municipal bonds 
net impairment losses recognized in earnings 
there was a negligible amount of impairment losses recognized in financial guaranty s earnings in the net impairment losses recognized in earnings for were comprised of impairments of fixed maturity investments available for sale and equity securities available for sale 
provision for losses 
the provision for losses for reflects expected losses in our structured finance reinsurance and public finance lines of business  which were reduced by million due to the commutation of a large portfolio and favorable developments in our structured finance direct line of business 
the provision for losses was higher in as a result of ongoing deterioration in our assumed reinsurance business 
policy acquisition costs 
the decrease in policy acquisition costs for compared to was mainly due to the decrease in net premiums earned during in addition  in  we wrote off million of deferred policy acquisition costs related to the commutation of a large portfolio  which reduced the base asset to be amortized 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses for as compared to included a decrease in employee costs  primarily due to lower severance and retention expense  bonus and stock based compensation expense  as well as lower outside consulting costs 
interest expense 
interest expense for and included an allocation to the financial guaranty segment of interest on our long term debt and other borrowings  based on allocated capital 
for  this allocation increased for our financial guaranty segment relative to our mortgage insurance segment 
income tax provision 
the effective tax rate was for compared to for the effective tax rate for reflects an increase in the ratio of income generated from tax advantaged investment securities compared to income generated from operations and an increase in tax expense relating to the accounting standard regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
results of operations financial services the following table shows a summary of the results of operations for our financial services segment year ended december in millions equity in net income of affiliate sherman gain on sale of affiliate sherman net income on may   radian guaranty sold to sherman all of its remaining equity interest in sherman for approximately million in cash  pursuant to a securities purchase agreement the sherman purchase agreement dated as of may   between radian guaranty and sherman 
we recorded a pre tax gain of 
table of contents approximately million in the second quarter of related to the sale 
prior to the sale of our equity interest in sherman  we recorded our share of equity in net income of sherman 
our equity in net income of affiliates from sherman in declined as a result of sherman s decreased net income in included in net income for was million of amortization related to an intangible asset that we consider a one time charge 
also included in net income for was the reversal of million of previously accrued management fee expense related to c bass 
contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  including payments under operating lease agreements  are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as liabilities but represent a contractual commitment to pay 
the following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations and commitments  including our expected claim payments on insurance policies  as of december   and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the narrative following the table and in the notes to consolidated financial statements that are referenced in the table 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years uncertain in thousands long term debt principal and interest note capital lease obligations operating lease commitments note nims derivative instruments and vies purchase obligations reserve for losses and lae note unrecognized tax benefits note total amounts represent management s estimate of credit loss payments related to these instruments as described in results of operations above 
our reserve for losses and lae reflects the application of accounting policies described below in critical accounting policies reserve for losses 
the payments due by period are based on management s estimates and assume that all of the loss reserves included in the table will result in claim payments  net of expected recoveries 
included in the uncertain category is million of unearned premium reserves  which are included in our reserve for losses and lae 
negative amounts presented are primarily related to expected recoveries on our financial guaranty claims 
the timing of these potential payments is uncertain given the nature of the obligation 
as of december   million of our total million of gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits associated with the provisions of the accounting standard regarding accounting for income taxes is expected to be paid in less than a year 
we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement for the remaining million of liability for unrecognized tax benefits due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with certain of our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 

table of contents other contractual obligations and commitments in addition to the contractual obligations set forth in the table above  we have the following contractual obligations and commitments 
investment commitments 
as part of the non investment grade component of our investment portfolio  we have committed to invest million in alternative investments that are primarily private equity structures 
at december   we had unfunded commitments of million 
these commitments have capital calls expected through  with the possibility of additional calls through  and certain fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
affiliate guaranty agreements 
we and certain of our subsidiaries have entered into the following intra company guarantees radian guaranty and amerin guaranty are parties to a cross guaranty agreement 
this agreement provides that if either party fails to make a payment to a policyholder  then the other party will step in and make the payment 
the obligations of both parties are unconditional and irrevocable  however  no payments may be made without prior approval by the insurance department of the payor s state of domicile 
amerin guaranty had no risk in force exposure as of december  radian guaranty has agreed to maintain radian insurance s tangible net worth at a minimum of million and to cause radian insurance at all times to have sufficient liquidity to meet its current obligations  pursuant to a net worth and liquidity maintenance agreement between the two companies 
radian group has agreed to guarantee  up to a maximum amount of million  radian guaranty s obligations to radian insurance under the net worth and liquidity maintenance agreement discussed immediately above  in the event that radian guaranty is not able to or permitted by the pennsylvania insurance department to perform under the agreement 
radian group and radian mortgage insurance inc radian mortgage insurance formerly known as commonwealth mortgage assurance company cmac of arizona  a subsidiary of radian guaranty  are parties to a guaranty agreement in which radian group has agreed for the benefit of radian mortgage insurance s creditors to make funds available on demand for the full and complete payment of all due but unpaid liabilities 
prior to our acquisition of enhance financial services group efsg in  efsg issued a guaranty of payment of the liabilities and obligations of its subsidiary  radian reinsurance bermuda limited radian re bermuda  deriving from any insurance or reinsurance contract the enhance guaranty  for the purpose of maintaining certain regulatory solvency and liquidity margin requirements of the bermuda monetary authority 
following our acquisition of efsg  radian group issued a guaranty for the benefit of efsg to make funds available to efsg for its performance of the enhance guaranty  to the extent that efsg is unable to satisfy those obligations 
as of january  radian re bermuda no longer had any insurance liabilities 
radian asset assurance and raal are parties to a capital maintenance agreement pursuant to which radian asset assurance has agreed to maintain raal s capital at a level not less that of the equivalent of the required margin of solvency pursuant to the regulations of the financial services authority fsa  raal s uk regulator  and to ensure that at all times raal has sufficient cash resources for the timely honoring of its contractual obligations 
radian asset assurance is not required to make any payments that would cause it to be in breach of its own minimum capital requirements  and certain payments by radian asset assurance pursuant to this agreement are specifically subject to the prior approval of the new york superintendent of insurance 
we are in the process of liquidating raal and plan to terminate the capital maintenance agreement in connection with such liquidation  which we expect to occur in 
table of contents radian group and amerin guaranty are parties to a guaranty agreement 
this agreement provides that radian group will make sufficient funds available to amerin guaranty to ensure that amerin guaranty has a minimum of million of statutory surplus every calendar quarter 
securities regulations became effective in that impose enhanced disclosure requirements on issuers of abs including mbs 
to allow our mortgage insurance customers to comply with these regulations  we have been required  depending on the amount of credit enhancement we were providing  to provide audited financial statements for the insurance subsidiary participating in these transactions or a full and unconditional holding company level guarantee for our insurance subsidiaries obligations in such transactions 
radian group has guaranteed two structured transactions for radian guaranty with approximately million of remaining credit exposure 
in addition to the foregoing  we use reinsurance from affiliated companies to allow radian guaranty to remain in compliance with insurance regulations that limit the amount of risk that a mortgage insurance company may retain on a single loan to of the indebtedness of the insured 
in february  radian guaranty  in order to further support its capital position  entered into an excess of loss reinsurance agreement with radian insurance 
under this agreement  radian guaranty transferred approximately billion of risk in force to radian insurance 
this pool of loans generally consists of a higher concentration of fixed rate  prime  high fico loans than our overall mortgage insurance portfolio 
as of december  the remaining risk in force under this agreement was million 
funding of compensation programs 
under our change of control agreements with our executive officers  upon a change of control of radian group or radian asset assurance  as the case may be  we are required to fund an irrevocable rabbi trust to the extent of our obligations under these agreements 
the total maximum amount that we would be required to place in trust is approximately million as of december  in addition  in the event of a change of control under our existing cash based incentive plans  we would be required to pay approximately million under these plans 
off balance sheet arrangements effective january   the accounting standard regarding accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities was amended to remove the concept of qualified special purpose entities qspes 
as a result  all vies must be evaluated for consolidation in accordance with the accounting standard regarding consolidation of vies 
as defined by the accounting standard  vies include corporations  trusts or partnerships in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
our interests in vies may be accounted for as insurance contracts or financial guaranty derivatives or in some cases  as described more fully below  we have consolidated the vies 
for insurance contracts with vies that we do not consolidate  we record reserves for losses and lae  and for derivative interests in vies that we do not consolidate  we record changes in the fair value as a corresponding derivative asset or derivative liability 
our primary involvement with vies relates to transactions in which we provide a financial guaranty to one or more classes of beneficial interest holders in the vie 
vies may also be used to create securities with a unique risk profile desired by investors and as a means of transferring risk  such as our smart home transactions 
we do not record the underlying assets or liabilities of the vies on our balance sheets unless we are the primary beneficiary of the vie 

table of contents smart home in  we developed a program referred to as smart home  for reinsuring risk associated with non prime mortgages and riskier products 
these reinsurance transactions  through the use of vie structures  effectively transfer risk from our portfolio to investors in the capital markets 
since august  we have completed four smart home reinsurance transactions 
details of these transactions aggregated as of the initial closing of each transaction and as of december  are as follows initial as of december pool of mortgages par value billion billion risk in force par value billion billion notes sold to investors risk ceded principal amount million million each transaction began with the formation of an unaffiliated  offshore reinsurance company 
we then entered into an agreement with the smart home reinsurer to cede to the reinsurer a portion of the risk and premium associated with a portfolio of loans 
each class relates to the loss coverage levels on the reinsured portfolio and is assigned a rating by one or more of the three major rating agencies 
we do not hold any of the credit linked notes issued as part of this structure  therefore  we have no significant variable interests in the structures  and are not subject to consolidation under this standard 
we exercised our option to terminate two of these transactions in february with risk in force of approximately million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
financial guaranty vies as a provider of credit enhancement  we have entered into insurance contracts with vies and derivative contracts with counterparties in which we have provided credit protection directly on variable interests by vies or  in some cases  obtained the contractual rights of our counterparties with respect to the vies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
put options on cps in september  radian asset assurance entered into a contingent capital transaction pursuant to which three custodial trusts issued an aggregate of million in cps million by each custodial trust to various holders 
based on our additional involvement in these trusts  we concluded that we are the party that directs the activities that most significantly influence the economic performance of these vies and has the right to receive benefits that would be significant to these vies 
we have now purchased substantially all of the cps 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
liquidity and capital resources radian group short term liquidity needs radian group serves as the holding company for our insurance subsidiaries and does not have any significant operations of its own 
radian group s principal liquidity demands for the next months include funds for i the payment of certain corporate expenses which are expected to be fully reimbursed through expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries  ii interest payments on our outstanding long term debt which are expected to be fully reimbursed through expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries  iii a payment to radian guaranty in october under our tax sharing agreement  iv potential capital support for our mortgage insurance subsidiaries  v repayment of approximately million in principal amount of our long term debt due june  and vi the payment of dividends on our common stock 

table of contents radian group had immediately available  directly or through an unregulated direct subsidiary  unrestricted cash and marketable securities of million at december   which includes million of investments contained in our cps custodial trusts as discussed below 
we expect to fund radian group s short term liquidity needs with i existing cash and marketable securities  including  if necessary  million held in the cps trust accounts and ii cash received under the expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries 
if radian group s current sources of liquidity are insufficient for radian group to fund its obligations  radian group may be required to seek additional capital by incurring additional debt  by issuing additional equity  or by selling assets  which we may not be able to do on favorable terms  if at all 
at december   we did not have the intent to sell any debt securities in an unrealized loss position and determined that it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the securities before recovery or maturity 
corporate expenses and interest expense 
radian group has expense sharing arrangements in place with its principal operating subsidiaries that require those subsidiaries to pay their share of holding company level expenses  including coupon rate interest payments on our long term debt 
payments of such corporate expenses for the next months  other than interest payments  are expected to be approximately million  which are expected to be fully reimbursed by our subsidiaries 
for the same period  payments of interest on our long term debt are expected to be approximately million  which also are expected to be fully reimbursed by our subsidiaries 
these expense sharing arrangements  as amended  have been approved by applicable state insurance departments  but such approval may be changed at any time 
tax payments 
under our current tax sharing agreement between radian group and its subsidiaries  our subsidiaries are required to pay to radian group  on a quarterly basis  amounts representing their estimated separate company tax liability for the current tax year 
radian group is required to refund to each subsidiary any amount that such subsidiary overpaid to radian group for a taxable year  as well as any amount that the subsidiary could utilize through existing carryback provisions of the internal revenue code irc had such subsidiary filed its federal tax return on a separate company basis 
under the provisions of this agreement  radian group paid approximately million to radian guaranty in october additionally  we currently estimate that radian group will be required to make a payment of approximately million to radian guaranty in  which is the maximum amount required under the tax sharing agreement and is determined based upon radian guaranty s separate company carryback ability for applicable net operating losses nols 
we also estimate that radian group will receive net tax sharing payments during of approximately million from other subsidiaries within our consolidated group 
our tax sharing agreement may not be changed without the pre approval of the applicable state insurance departments for certain of the insurance subsidiaries that are party to the agreement 
in november  new tax legislation was enacted that provides an election to extend the existing carryback period for applicable nols incurred in either or but not both years from two years to up to five years 
in september  we amended our consolidated federal income tax return and made the election to extend our nol carryback period to five years 
this election was primarily made to preserve our maximum nol carryback period allowed under current tax law and to provide us with an opportunity to utilize our nol as a potential offset to any unsettled internal revenue service irs proposed adjustments relating to the through tax periods  which we are currently contesting with the irs 
see risk factors the irs is examining our tax returns for the years through while no additional federal income tax refund opportunities were created for radian group through its election to extend the nol carryback period  additional tax sharing agreement payments were required to be paid by radian group to certain insurance subsidiaries other than radian guaranty 
in october  radian group paid approximately million to these insurance subsidiaries as a result of its election to extend its nol carryback period 

table of contents as of the balance sheet dates  certain of our insurance subsidiaries have incurred estimated nols that  if computed on a separate company return basis  could not be fully utilized through existing carryback provisions of the irc 
as a result  we are not currently obligated to reimburse them for these unutilized tax losses 
however  if in a future period  any of these subsidiaries generate taxable income such that they are able to realize their individual nol carryforward under the irc  then we will be obligated under the tax sharing agreement to fund such subsidiary s portion of its operating loss that has been utilized on a consolidated group tax return basis 
currently  we do not expect to fund material obligations under the provisions described in this paragraph with regard to subsidiary nols incurred to date 
capital support for subsidiaries 
radian group could be required to provide capital support for our mortgage insurance subsidiaries if additional capital is required pursuant to insurance laws and regulations or by the gses or the rating agencies 
for example  cmac of texas  a texas domiciled mortgage insurance subsidiary that provides radian guaranty with reinsurance on certain insurance coverages primary insurance coverage in excess of of the principal balance of the insured loan and pool insurance  incurred a significant loss in the first half of  in part due to the increase in severity estimates for our pool insurance claims during that period 
as a result  cmac of texas required capital contributions totaling approximately million during million was funded by radian group and million was funded by radian guaranty in order to maintain a minimum statutory capital level 
similarly  radian mortgage insurance  an arizona domiciled mortgage insurance subsidiary that also provides radian guaranty with pool reinsurance  required capital contributions from radian guaranty totaling approximately million during  including million in the fourth quarter of  in order to maintain a minimum statutory capital level 
radian group contributed million to radian guaranty in to support its capital position 
radian group may make additional capital contributions to radian guaranty in in order to further support its capital position and to maintain radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio below the statutory maximum of to see risk factors losses in our mortgage insurance business have reduced radian guaranty s statutory surplus and increased radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio  additional losses in our mortgage insurance portfolio or financial guaranty portfolio without a corresponding increase in new capital or capital relief could further negatively impact these ratios  which could limit radian guaranty s ability to write new insurance and could increase restrictions and requirements placed on radian guaranty 
dividends 
our quarterly common stock dividend is per share 
assuming that our outstanding common stock remains constant at  shares the number of shares outstanding at december   we would require approximately million in the aggregate to pay our quarterly dividends for the next months 
in addition to existing available cash and marketable securities  dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and permitted payments to radian group under tax and expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries are radian group s principal sources of cash 
our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to radian group is subject to various conditions imposed by the gses and rating agencies  and by insurance regulations requiring insurance department approval 
in general  dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require insurance department approval 
in light of ongoing losses in our mortgage insurance subsidiaries  we do not anticipate that these subsidiaries will be permitted under applicable insurance laws to issue dividends to radian group for the foreseeable future 
to the extent radian asset assurance is permitted to issue dividends  these dividends will be issued to its direct parent  radian guaranty  and not to radian group 
in september  radian asset assurance entered into a contingent capital transaction pursuant to which three custodial trusts issued an aggregate of million in cps million by each custodial trust to various holders 
as part of this transaction  radian asset securities inc radian asset securities  our wholly owned subsidiary  entered into a separate perpetual put option agreement with each custodial trust  and radian asset assurance entered into three corresponding perpetual put option agreements with radian asset securities 
as of december   radian group and its subsidiaries had purchased by tender offer and privately negotiated 
table of contents transactions  substantially all of the face amount of the cps issued by the custodial trusts at a weighted average purchase price approximately equal to of the face amount of such cps 
we expect to dissolve the custodial trust  which would result in the distribution of the million in cash held by the custodial trust to radian group and its subsidiaries  as a holder of the cps for such custodial trusts 
radian group long term liquidity needs our most significant need for liquidity beyond the next months is the repayment of the principal amount of our outstanding long term debt that comes due in  and at december   approximately million in principal amount of our long term debt is due in each of and  and million in principal is due in we may redeem or continue to repurchase some or all of our outstanding debt if circumstances are favorable to us 
at this time  we cannot determine the timing or amount of any potential repurchases  which will depend on a number of factors  including our capital and liquidity needs 
we expect to meet the long term liquidity needs of radian group with i available cash and marketable securities  including million held in the cps trust fund accounts ii additional potential private or public issuances of debt or equity securities  iii cash received under tax and expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries and iv the sale of assets or from dividends from our subsidiaries 
if necessary  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our long term debt  but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on favorable terms  if at all 
in november  we issued million principal amount of convertible  unsecured senior notes due november the notes mature on november  upon a conversion  we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver  as the case may be  cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock  at our election  in respect of the remainder  if any  of our conversion obligation that is in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted 
the conversion rate will initially be shares of our common stock per  principal amount of notes corresponding to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
the conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain events  but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
in addition  following certain corporate events  we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with that corporate event in certain circumstances 
holders of the notes will be able to convert their notes  at their option  before the close of business on the business day immediately preceding august   only under the following circumstances during any calendar quarter after december  and only during such calendar quarter  if the last reported sale price of our common stock for each of at least trading days whether or not consecutive during the consecutive trading days ending on  and including  the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter  is greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day  during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of the notes for each trading day during that measurement period  was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the common stock and the applicable conversion rate on such trading day  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as described in the indenture for the notes 
in connection with the offering of the convertible notes  we also entered into capped call transactions with an affiliate of morgan stanley co  incorporated  whose obligations have been guaranteed by morgan stanley 

table of contents these capped call transactions each have an initial strike price equal to the initial conversion price of the convertible notes and a cap price initially equal to approximately  or approximately of the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse on november  in each case subject to certain anti dilutive adjustments similar to those in the notes 
these capped call transactions are intended to offset the potential dilution to our common stock and or any potential cash payments that may be required to be made by us upon conversion of the convertible notes in excess of the principal amount of converted notes  up to the initial cap of per share 
if  however  the market value per share of our common stock  as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions  exceeds the applicable cap price of the transactions  the number of shares of our common stock and or the amount of cash we expect to receive upon the exercise of the capped call transactions will be capped and the anti dilutive and or offsetting effect of the transactions will be limited 
we paid approximately million from the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of convertible notes to purchase these capped call transactions 
the terms of the convertible notes contain customary events of default including payment defaults  failure to comply with covenants and certain insolvency events 
the occurrence of an event of default may lead the outstanding principal and unpaid interest of the convertible notes to be immediately due and payable 
in addition to the convertible notes  as of december   we had outstanding million of outstanding principal amount of debentures due in  million principal amount of senior notes due in and million principal amount of senior notes due in for additional information regarding our long term debt  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
mortgage insurance the principal liquidity requirements of our mortgage insurance business include the payment of claims  operating expenses including those allocated from radian group  taxes and potential capital support for its mortgage insurance subsidiaries 
the principal sources of liquidity in our mortgage insurance business are capital contributions from radian group radian group contributed million to radian guaranty in  insurance premiums  net investment income  cash dividends from radian asset assurance  and potential payments from radian group under our tax allocation agreement 
our mortgage insurance business has incurred significant losses during the past four years due to the housing and related credit market downturns 
we believe that the operating cash flows generated by each of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries will provide these subsidiaries with a portion of the funds necessary to satisfy their claim payments and operating expenses for the foreseeable future 
we believe that any shortfall can be funded from sales of short term marketable securities held by our mortgage insurance subsidiaries  from maturing fixed income investments and from the sale of less liquid marketable securities held by our mortgage insurance business 
as discussed above  as a result of losses incurred by cmac of texas and radian mortgage insurance during  radian guaranty contributed approximately million to radian mortgage insurance and million to cmac of texas during  to enable these subsidiaries to satisfy their minimum statutory capital requirements 
additional capital support for these and other subsidiaries may be required in the near and long term 
as of december   radian asset assurance maintained claims paying resources of billion  including statutory surplus of approximately billion 
during  radian asset assurance paid a dividend of million to radian guaranty 
we currently anticipate that radian asset assurance will have the capacity to pay another ordinary dividend of approximately million to radian guaranty in june the amount  if any  and timing of radian asset assurance s dividend paying capacity will depend  in part  on the performance of our insured financial guaranty portfolio  including the establishment or increase in statutory reserves  as well as the amount we pay to commute transactions 
if the exposure in our financial 
table of contents guaranty business is reduced on an accelerated basis through the recapture of business from the primary customers in our financial guaranty reinsurance business or otherwise  we may have the ability to release capital to our mortgage insurance business more quickly and in a greater amount 
however  if the performance of our financial guaranty portfolio deteriorates materially  radian asset assurance may have limited or no capacity to issue dividends to radian guaranty 
in the event of a default giving rise to a claim payment obligation in our financial guaranty business  the statutory capital of radian asset assurance and consequently radian guaranty would be reduced in an amount equal to the present value of our expected future net claim liability net of taxes for such transactions 
any reduction in statutory capital would also likely reduce radian asset assurance s capacity to issue dividends to radian guaranty  and radian asset assurance could be restricted from issuing dividends altogether without prior approval from the new york state insurance department 
we transferred our equity interest in sherman to radian guaranty in the fourth quarter of following this transfer  radian guaranty received a million dividend from sherman in the first quarter of  and a million dividend in april on may   radian guaranty sold all of its remaining equity interest in sherman for approximately million in cash 
financial guaranty the principal short term and long term liquidity requirements of our financial guaranty business include the payment of operating expenses including those allocated from radian group  claim and commutation payments  taxes  and dividends to radian guaranty 
as of december   we have eight cds contracts with respect to seven trups bonds pursuant to which we may be required to pay our counterparty the outstanding par amount of our insured trups bonds a liquidity claim 
a liquidity claim may arise if an event of default under the trups bond eg  a failure to pay interest or a breach of covenants requiring the maintenance of a certain level of performing collateral existed as of the termination date of the cds contract 
the termination dates of these cds contracts currently range between and  but automatically extend for additional one year increments but no later than the maturity date of the trups cdo unless terminated by our counterparty 
if we are required to pay a liquidity claim  our counterparty would be obligated under the cds to either deliver the insured trups bond to us or to periodically pay us cash in an amount equal to any future amounts paid in respect of principal and interest on the insured trups bond 
we may be required to pay a liquidity claim on one cds contract representing million in net par outstanding  for which we are currently paying interest shortfalls that is currently scheduled to terminate in july we are exploring loss mitigation alternatives with respect to this trups bond  including the possibility of commuting our remaining risk on this bond 
we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in such loss mitigation efforts 
the principal sources of liquidity in our financial guaranty business are premium collections  credit enhancement fees on credit derivative contracts and net investment income 
we believe that the cash flows generated by our financial guaranty subsidiaries will provide these subsidiaries with the funds necessary to satisfy their claim payments and operating expenses for the foreseeable future 
we believe that we have the ability to fund any operating cash flow shortfall from sales of marketable securities in our investment portfolio maintained at our operating companies and from maturing fixed income investments 
in the event that we are unable to fund excess claim payments and operating expenses through the sale of these marketable securities and from maturing fixed income investments  we may be required to incur unanticipated capital losses or delays in connection with the sale of less liquid marketable securities held by our financial guaranty business

during and most of  our trading securities activity reflected active and frequent buying and selling  as market prices of our investments strengthened as a result of the improving domestic and global economic environment  and we made the decision to opportunistically realize gains in the investment portfolio 
as such  this activity was reflected as cash flows from operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows during and most of beginning in the fourth quarter of and for all of  we have classified purchases of trading securities within cash flows from investing activities  since those purchases are more consistent with our overall investment strategy 
while our trading securities activity was significant  it was primarily driven by the strategic repositioning of the portfolio in order to shorten duration for liquidity purposes  and increase our allocation to taxable bonds to maximize our after tax yields 
because this activity relates to overall strategic initiatives and is not trading related  it is reflected as cash flows from investing activities 
we expect that we will use more cash than we generate from operations during the next months 

table of contents stockholders equity stockholders equity was billion at december   compared to billion at december  the decrease in stockholders equity resulted primarily from our net loss of billion for  caused primarily by the establishment of a valuation allowance against our dta and large unrealized losses on our derivative instruments 
these losses were partially offset by a million increase in additional paid in capital resulting from our million common stock public offering in may and our november public offering of million principal amount of convertible senior notes due ratings radian group inc radian group and certain of our operating subsidiaries have been assigned the ratings provided in the chart below 
we believe that ratings often are considered by others in assessing our credit strength and the financial strength of our insurance subsidiaries and  historically  it also has been a significant factor in determining radian guaranty s eligibility with the gses 
see risk factors we could lose our eligibility status with the gses  causing freddie mac and fannie mae to decide not to purchase mortgages insured by us  which would significantly impair our mortgage insurance franchise in item a of part i of this annual report on form k

recent ratings actions s p on january   s p released proposed changes to its ratings criteria for financial guarantors  which among other things  adds additional qualitative and quantitative tests to their criteria 
s p has indicated that it expects that  if implemented  the proposed changes would significantly increase the capital required by financial guarantors in order for them to achieve the highest investment grade ratings from s p 
because radian asset assurance is currently rated below investment grade  we are uncertain what impact  if any  the proposed changes will have on radian asset assurance or radian group 
these changes could  however  have a material adverse effect on other financial guarantors or the financial guaranty industry in general  and could make it more difficult for us to successfully utilize the fg insurance shell or further reduce our financial guaranty exposure through commutations or recaptures of business by our primary ceding customers 
critical accounting policies sec guidance defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  management has made estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized available information  including our past history  industry standards and the current and projected economic and housing 
table of contents environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates  assumptions and judgments  giving due consideration to materiality 
because the use of estimates is inherent in gaap  actual results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  assumptions or judgments which may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is set forth below 
reserve for losses we establish reserves to provide for losses and lae and the estimated costs of settling claims in both our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty segments 
the accounting standard regarding accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises specifically excludes mortgage insurance from its guidance relating to the reserve for losses but does not provide any other specific guidance 
therefore  because of the lack of specific guidance  we establish reserves for mortgage insurance using the guidance contained in this standard  supplemented with other accounting guidance as described below 
estimating the loss reserves in both our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty business segments involves significant reliance upon assumptions and estimates with regard to the likelihood  magnitude and timing of each potential loss 
the models  assumptions and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may not prove to be accurate  especially during an extended economic downturn or a period of extreme market volatility as currently exists 
we cannot be certain that we have correctly estimated the necessary amount of reserves or that the reserves established will be adequate to cover ultimate losses on incurred defaults 
mortgage insurance in the mortgage insurance segment  reserves for losses are not established until a borrower has missed two monthly payments 
we also establish reserves for associated lae  consisting of the estimated cost of the claims administration process  including legal and other fees and expenses associated with administering the claims process 
we maintain an extensive database of claim payment history and use models  based on a variety of loan characteristics  including the status of the loan as reported by its servicer and the type of loan product to determine the likelihood that a default will reach claim status 
we also forecast the impact of our loss mitigation efforts in protecting us against fraud  underwriting negligence  breach of representation and warranties  and other items that may give rise to insurance rescissions and claim denials  to help determine the default to claim rate 
lastly  we project the amount that we will pay if a default becomes a claim referred to as claim severity 
based on these estimates  we arrive at our estimate of loss reserves at a given point in time 
the default and claim cycle in our mortgage insurance business begins with our receipt of a default notice from the servicer 
for financial statement reporting and internal tracking purposes  we do not consider a loan to be in default until the borrower has missed two monthly payments 
with respect to loans that are in an early stage of default  considerable judgment is exercised as to the adequacy of reserve levels 
adjustments in estimates for loans in the early stage of default are more volatile in nature than for loans that are in the later stage of default  which generally require a larger reserve 
as the default proceeds towards foreclosure  there is generally more certainty around these estimates as a result of the aged status of the defaulted loan  and adjustments are made to loss reserves to reflect this updated information 
if a default cures historically  a large percentage of defaulted loans have cured  the reserve for that loan is removed from the reserve for losses and lae 
we also establish reserves for defaults that we estimate have been incurred but not been reported to us on a timely basis  and for defaults related to previously rescinded policies and denied claims which are likely to be reinstated  in the case of previously rescinded policies  or resubmitted in the case of previously denied claims 
due to the period of time generally up to days that we give the insured to rebut 
table of contents our decision to rescind coverage before we consider a policy to be rescinded and removed from our default inventory  we do not currently expect a material amount of policies that were ultimately rescinded to be reinstated 
all estimates are periodically reviewed and adjustments are made as they become necessary 
we do not establish reserves for loans that are in default if we believe that we will not be liable for the payment of a claim with respect to that default 
for example  for those defaults in which we are in a second loss position  we initially calculate the reserve for defaulted loans in the transaction as if there were no deductible 
if the existing deductible for a given structured transaction is greater than the reserve amount for the defaults contained within the transaction  we do not establish a reserve for the defaults  or if appropriate  we record a partial reserve 
we do not establish loss reserves for expected future claims on insured mortgages that are not in default 
see reserve for premium deficiency below for an exception to this general principle 
each loan that we insure is unique  but for purposes of reserve modeling  loans are aggregated into groups using a variety of factors 
the attributes used to define the groups include  but are not limited to  the default status of the loans ie  number of days in default  product type ie  prime  alt a  and subprime  type of insurance ie  primary or pool  vintage year  loss position ie  with or without a deductible  and the state where the property is located segregated into three state groups in order to adjust for differences in foreclosure timing 
we use an actuarial projection methodology referred to as a roll rate analysis that uses historical claim frequency information to determine the projected ultimate default to claim rates for each product and default status 
the default to claim rate also includes our estimates with respect to expected insurance rescissions and claim denials  which have the effect of reducing our default to claim rates 
recently  we have experienced an elevated level of insurance rescissions and claim denials for various reasons  including  without limitation  underwriting negligence  fraudulent applications and appraisals  breach of representations and warranties  and inadequate documentation  reflecting the poor underwriting periods of through after estimating the default to claim rate  we estimate the severity of each product type  type of insurance  and state grouping based on the average of recently observed severity rates 
these average severity estimates are then applied to individual loan coverage amounts to determine reserves 
our default to claim rate assumption was at december   at december   and at december  the increase from to was attributable to the aging of underlying defaulted loans and a decrease in our estimate of rescissions and denials for our ending default inventory as of december   which was primarily attributable to the realization of rescissions and denials during the decrease from to was primarily as a result of an increase in our estimate of rescissions and denials  which was based on actual recent experience at that time 
a key assumption affecting our reserving methodology is that our default to claim rates and severities will be consistent with our recent experience 
our estimate of expected insurance rescissions and claim denials embedded in our default to claim rate is generally based on our experience over the past year  with consideration given for differences in characteristics between those rescinded policies and denied claims and the remaining default inventory 
we expect our rescission and denial rates to remain at elevated levels as long as defaults related to the poor underwriting periods of through represent a significant percentage of our total default portfolio 
the elevated levels in the rate of rescissions and denials during and have led to an increased risk of litigation by lenders and policyholders challenging our right to rescind coverage or deny claims 
such challenges may be made several years after we have rescinded a certificate of insurance or denied a claim 
recently  we have faced an increasing number of challenges from certain lender customers regarding our insurance rescissions and claim denials  which have resulted in some reversals of our decisions regarding rescissions and denials 
although we believe that our rescissions and denials are justified under our policies  if we are not successful in defending the rescissions and denials in any potential legal or other actions  we may need to reassume the risk on  and reestablish loss reserves for  those policies or pay additional claims 
the assumptions embedded in our estimated default to claim rate on our in force default inventory includes an adjustment to our estimated rescission and denial rate  to account for the fact that we expect a certain number of policies for which an initial intent to rescind letter has been sent to our lender customers to remain in force and ultimately be paid  as a result of valid challenges by such policy holders 

table of contents we considered the sensitivity of first lien loss reserve estimates at december   by assessing the potential changes resulting from a parallel shift in severity and default to claim rate 
for example  assuming all other factors remain constant  for every one percentage point change in primary claim severity which we estimate to be of unpaid principal balance at december   we estimated that our loss reserves would change by approximately million at december  for every one percentage point change in pool claim severity which we estimate to be of unpaid principal balance at december   we estimated that our loss reserves would change by approximately million at december  for every one percentage point change in our overall default to claim rate which we estimate to be at december   including our assumptions related to rescissions and denials  we estimated an million change in our loss reserves at december  reserves for our mortgage insurance business are recorded based on our estimate of loss and lae reserves 
we make regular adjustments to the underlying assumptions in our model as discussed above  and believe the amount generated by our model at december  represents our best estimate of our future losses and lae on existing defaults 
financial guaranty in our financial guaranty segment  we recognize a claim liability on our non derivative transactions prior to an event of default insured event when there is evidence that credit deterioration has occurred for a particular policy  and when the present value of the expected claim loss will exceed the unearned premium revenue 
the expected claim loss is based on the probability weighted present value of expected net cash outflows to be paid under the policy 
in measuring the claim liability  we develop the present value of expected net cash outflows by using our own assumptions about the likelihood of all possible outcomes  based on information currently available 
we determine the existence of credit deterioration on directly insured policies based on periodic reporting from the insured party  indenture trustee or servicer  and based on our surveillance efforts 
these expected cash outflows are discounted using a risk free rate 
our assumptions about the likelihood of outcomes  expected cash outflows and the appropriate risk free rate are updated each reporting period 
for assumed policies  we use information provided by the ceding company  as well as our specific knowledge of the credit for determining expected loss 
the risk management function in our financial guaranty business is responsible for the identification  analysis  measurement and surveillance of credit  market  legal and operational risk associated with our financial guaranty insurance contracts 
risk management  working with our legal group  is also primarily responsible for claims prevention and loss mitigation strategies 
this discipline is applied during the ongoing monitoring and surveillance of each exposure in the portfolio as well as at the point of origination of a transaction 
there are both performing and under performing credits in our financial guaranty portfolio 
performing credits generally have investment grade internal ratings  denoting nominal to moderate credit risk 
however  claim liabilities may be established for performing credits if the expected losses on the credit exceed the unearned premium revenue for the contract based on the present value of the expected net cash outflows 
if our risk management department concludes that a directly insured transaction should no longer be considered performing  it is placed in one of three designated watch list categories for deteriorating credits special mention  intensified surveillance or case reserve 
assumed exposures in financial guaranty s reinsurance portfolio are generally placed in one of these categories if the ceding company for such transaction downgrades it to an equivalent watch list classification 
however  should our financial guaranty risk management group disagree with the risk rating assigned by the ceding company  we may assign our own risk rating rather than use the risk rating assigned by the ceding company 
prior to our adoption on january  of the update to the accounting standard regarding accounting for financial guaranty insurance contracts for all non derivative financial guaranty insurance policies  we established case and lae reserves for specifically identified impaired credits that had defaulted and allocated non specific and lae reserves for specific credits that we expected to default case reserves and allocated non specific reserves combined represented our allocated reserves 
we also recorded unallocated non specific reserves for 
table of contents other losses on a portfolio basis 
our unallocated non specific reserves were established over time by applying an expected loss ratio to the premiums earned during each reporting period and discretionary adjustments by management as appropriate due to changes in expected frequency and severity of losses 
reserve for premium deficiency we have a second lien premium deficiency reserve pdr of million as of december  insurance enterprises are required to establish a pdr if the net present value of the expected future losses and expenses for a particular product exceeds the net present value of expected future premiums and existing reserves for that product 
we reassess our expectations for premiums  losses and expenses for each of our mortgage insurance businesses at least quarterly and update our premium deficiency analysis accordingly 
for purposes of our premium deficiency analysis  we group our mortgage insurance products into two categories  first lien and second lien 
numerous factors affect our ultimate claim rates  including home price changes  unemployment  the impact of our loss mitigation efforts and interest rates  as well as potential benefits associated with lender and governmental initiatives to modify loans and ultimately reduce foreclosures 
to assess the need for a pdr on our first lien mortgage insurance portfolio  we develop loss projections based on modeled loan defaults related to our current risk in force 
this projection is based on recent trends in default experience  severity  and rates of defaulted loans moving to claim such default to claim rates are net of our estimates of rescissions and denials  as well as recent trends in the rate at which loans are prepaid 
as of december   our modeled loan default projections assume that the rate at which current loans will default will remain consistent with those rates observed at december  for nine months  and then gradually return to normal historical levels over the subsequent two years 
for our first lien mortgage insurance business  because the combination of the net present value of expected premiums and already established reserves net of reinsurance recoverables exceeds the net present value of expected losses and expenses  a first lien pdr was not required as of december  expected losses are based on an assumed paid claim rate of approximately on our total primary first lien mortgage insurance portfolio  which includes both delinquent loans and current loans  comprising on prime  on subprime and on alt a 
while deterioration in the macroeconomic environment has resulted in an increase in expected losses  new business originated since the beginning of is expected to be profitable  which has contributed to the overall expected net profitability of our first lien portfolio 
in addition  our estimated rescissions and denials on insured loans  as part of our loss mitigation efforts  partially offset the impact of expected defaults and claims 
for our second lien mortgage insurance business  we project future premiums and losses for this business on a transaction by transaction basis  using historical results to help determine future performance for both repayments and claims 
an estimated expense factor is then applied  and the result is discounted using a rate of return that approximates our investment yield 
this net present value  less any existing reserves  is recorded as a premium deficiency and the reserve is updated at least quarterly based on actual results for that quarter  along with updated transaction level projections 
fair value of financial instruments our fair value measurements are intended to reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available 
assumptions include the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique such as a pricing model and or the risks inherent in the inputs to the model 
we define fair value as the current amount that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability  other than in a forced liquidation 
in the event that our investments or derivative contracts were sold or transferred in a forced liquidation  the amounts received or paid may be materially different than those determined in accordance with this standard 
effective january   we adopted the update to the accounting standard regarding fair 
table of contents value measurements and disclosures 
this update requires new disclosures regarding significant transfers in and out of level i and level ii fair value measurements 
additional disclosures regarding the reconciliation of level iii fair value measurements are not required until when determining the fair value of our liabilities  we are required to incorporate into the fair value an adjustment that reflects our own non performance risk 
our cds spread is the only observable quantitative measure of our non performance risk and is used by typical market participants to determine the likelihood of our default 
as our cds spread tightens or widens  it has the effect of increasing or decreasing  respectively  the fair value of our liabilities 
we established a fair value hierarchy by prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level i measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level iii measurements 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under this standard are described below level i unadjusted quoted prices or valuations in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities  level ii quoted prices or valuations in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable  either directly or indirectly  and level iii prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable 
the level of market activity in determining the fair value hierarchy is based on the availability of observable inputs market participants would use to price an asset or a liability  including market value price observations 
for markets in which inputs are not observable or limited  we use significant judgment and assumptions that a typical market participant would use to evaluate the market price of an asset or liability 
these assets and liabilities are classified in level iii of our fair value hierarchy 
a financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
at december   our total level iii assets were approximately of total assets measured at fair value and total level iii liabilities accounted for of total liabilities measured at fair value 
available for sale securities  trading securities  vie debt  derivative instruments  and certain other assets are recorded at fair value as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
all derivative instruments and contracts are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as either derivative assets or derivative liabilities 
all changes in fair value of trading securities  vie debt  derivative instruments and certain other assets are included in the statements of operations 
all changes in the fair value of available for sale securities are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the following are descriptions of our valuation methodologies for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
investments us government and agency securities the fair value of us government and agency securities is estimated using observed market transactions  including broker dealer quotes and actual trade activity as a basis for valuation 
us government and agency securities are categorized in either level i or level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
state and municipal obligations the fair value of state and municipal obligations is estimated using recent transaction activity  including market and market like observations 
evaluation models are used  which 
table of contents incorporate bond structure  yield curve  credit spreads  and other factors 
these securities are generally categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy or in level iii when market based transaction activity is unavailable 
money market instruments the fair value of money market instruments is based on daily prices  which are published and available to all potential investors and market participants 
as such  these securities are categorized in level i of the fair value hierarchy 
corporate bonds and notes the fair value of corporate bonds and notes is estimated using recent transaction activity  including market and market like observations 
spread models are used that incorporate issuer and structure characteristics  such as credit risk and early redemption features  where applicable 
these securities are generally categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy or in level iii when market based transaction activity is unavailable 
rmbs the fair value of rmbs is estimated based on prices of comparable securities and spreads  and observable prepayment speeds 
these securities are generally categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy or in level iii when market based transaction activity is unavailable 
the fair value of the level iii securities is generally estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows 
cmbs the fair value of cmbs is estimated based on prices of comparable securities and spreads  and observable prepayment speeds 
these securities are generally categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy or in level iii when market based transaction activity is unavailable 
the fair value of the level iii securities is generally estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows 
cdo these securities are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
the fair value of the level iii securities is generally estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows 
other abs the fair value of other abs is estimated based on prices of comparable securities and spreads  and observable prepayment speeds 
these securities are generally categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy or in level iii when market based transaction activity is unavailable 
the fair value of the level iii securities is generally estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows 
foreign government securities the fair value of foreign government securities is estimated using observed market yields used to create a maturity curve and observed credit spreads from market makers and broker dealers 
these securities are categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
hybrid securities these instruments are convertible securities measured at fair value 
the estimated fair value is derived  in part  by utilizing dealer quotes and observed bond and stock prices 
for certain securities  the underlying security price may be adjusted to account for observable changes in the conversion and investment value from the time the quote was obtained 
these securities are categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
equity securities the fair value of these securities is generally estimated using observable market data in active markets or bid prices from market makers and broker dealers 
generally  these securities are categorized in level i or ii of the fair value hierarchy as observable market data are readily available 
a small number of our equity securities  however  are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy due to a lack of market based transaction data or the use of model based evaluations 
other investments these securities primarily consist of short term commercial paper within cps trusts  which are categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
the fair value of the remaining securities is categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy  and is generally estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows 

table of contents derivative instruments and related vie assets liabilities we define fair value as the current amount that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability  other than in a forced liquidation 
in determining an exit market  we consider the fact that most of our derivative contracts are unconditional and irrevocable  and contractually prohibit us from transferring them to other capital market participants 
accordingly  there is no principal market for such highly structured insured credit derivatives 
in the absence of a principal market  we value these insured credit derivatives in a hypothetical market where market participants include other monoline mortgage and financial guaranty insurers with similar credit quality to us  as if the risk of loss on these contracts could be transferred to these other mortgage and financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance companies 
we believe that in the absence of a principal market  this hypothetical market provides the most relevant information with respect to fair value estimates 
we determine the fair value of our derivative instruments primarily using internally generated models 
we utilize market observable inputs  such as credit spreads on similar products  whenever they are available 
when one of our transactions develops characteristics that are inconsistent with the characteristics of transactions that underlie the relevant market based index that we use in our credit spread valuation approach  and more relevant inputs or projections become available that we believe would represent the view of a typical market participant  we change to an approach that is based on the relevant available information 
this change in approach is generally prompted when the credit component  and not market factors  becomes the dominant driver of the estimated fair value for a particular transaction 
there is a high degree of uncertainty about our fair value estimates since our contracts are not traded or exchanged  which makes external validation and corroboration of our estimates difficult  particularly given the current market environment  where very few  if any  contracts are being traded or originated 
in very limited recent instances  we have negotiated terminations of financial guaranty contracts with our counterparties and believe that such terminations provide the most relevant data with respect to validating our fair value estimates and such data has been generally consistent with our fair value estimates 
our derivative liabilities valuation methodology incorporates our own non performance risk by including our observable cds spread as an input into the determination of the fair value of our derivative liabilities 
considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates may not be indicative of amounts we could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a significant effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
put options on cps and consolidated cps vie debt the fair value of our put options on cps and the cps vie debt  in the absence of observable market data  is estimated based on the present value of the spread differential between the current market rate of issuing a perpetual preferred security and the maximum contractual rate of our perpetual preferred security as specified in our put option agreements 
in determining the current market rate  consideration is given to any relevant market observations that are available 
subsequent to our tender and purchase of the majority of the securities of two of the three trusts to which our put options relate  we consolidated the assets and liabilities of those two trusts effective january  we purchased substantially all of the securities issued by the remaining trust  and we consolidated the assets and liabilities of that trust during as of december   there is no consolidated cps vie debt because we own approximately of all three trusts and  as such  the put options on cps are eliminated in consolidation as well 
nims credit derivatives  nims derivative assets and nims vie debt nims are financial guarantees that we have issued on nims 
nims derivative assets primarily represent derivative assets in the nims trusts that we are required to consolidate 
nims vie debt represents the debt of consolidated nims trusts  which we account for at fair value 
the estimated fair value amounts of these financial instruments are derived from internally generated discounted cash flow models 
we estimate losses in each 
table of contents securitization underlying either the nims credit derivatives  nims derivative assets or nims vie debt by applying expected default rates separately to loans that are delinquent and those that are paying currently 
these default rates are based on historical experience of similar transactions 
we then estimate the rate of prepayments on the underlying collateral in each securitization  incorporating historical prepayment experience 
the estimated loss and rate of prepayments are used to estimate the cash flows for each underlying securitization and nims bond  and ultimately  to produce the projected credit losses for each nims bond 
in addition to expected credit losses  we consider the future expected premiums to be received from the nims trust for each credit derivative 
the projected net losses are then discounted using a rate of return that incorporates our own non performance risk  and based on our current cds spread  results in a reduction of the derivative liability 
since nims guarantees are not market traded instruments  considerable judgment is required in estimating fair value 
the use of different assumptions and or methodologies could have a significant effect on estimated fair values 
the nims credit derivatives  nims derivative assets and nims vie debt are all categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
as a result of our having to consolidate our nims vies  the fair value of derivative assets held by the nims vies and the nims vie debt are determined by using the same internally generated valuation model 
changes in expected principal credit losses on nims could have a significant impact on our fair value estimate 
the gross expected principal credit losses were million as of december   which is our best estimate of settlement value at that date and represents substantially all of our total risk in force 
the recorded fair value of our total net liabilities related to nims as of december  was million  of which million relates to derivative assets and million relates to debt of the nims vie trusts 
our fair value estimate incorporates a discount rate that is based on our cds spread  which has resulted in a fair value amount that is million less than the expected principal credit losses 
changes in the credit loss estimates will impact the fair value directly  reduced only by the present value factor  which is dependent on the timing of the expected losses and our credit spread 
corporate cdos the fair value of each of our corporate cdo transactions is estimated based on the difference between the present value of the expected future contractual premiums we charge and the fair premium amount that we estimate that another financial guarantor would require to assume the rights and obligations under our contracts 
the fair value estimates reflect the fair value of the asset or liability  which is consistent with the in exchange approach  in which fair value is determined based on the price that would be received or paid in a current transaction as defined by the accounting standard regarding fair value measurements 
these credit derivatives are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
present value of expected future contractual premiums our contractual premiums are subject to change primarily for two reasons all of our contracts provide our counterparties with the right to terminate upon our default and of the aggregate net par outstanding of our corporate cdo transactions as of december  provide our counterparties with the right to terminate these transactions based on certain rating agency downgrades that occurred in the past 
in determining the expected future premiums of these transactions  we adjust the contractual premiums for such transactions to reflect the estimated fair value of those premiums based on our estimate of the probability of our counterparties exercising this downgrade termination right and the impact it would have on the remaining expected lifetime premium 
in these circumstances  we also cap the total estimated fair value of the contracts at zero  such that none of the contracts subject to immediate termination are in a derivative asset position 
the discount rate we use to determine the present value of expected future premiums is our cds spread plus a risk free rate 
this discount rate reflects the risk that we may not collect future premiums due to our inability to satisfy our contractual obligations  which provides our counterparties the right to terminate the contracts 

table of contents determining the fair premium amount for each corporate cdo transaction  we perform three principal steps in determining the fair premium amount first  we define a tranche on the cdx index defined below that equates to the risk profile of our specific transaction we refer to this tranche as an equivalent risk tranche  second  we determine the fair premium amount on the equivalent risk tranche for those market participants engaged in trading on the cdx index we refer to each of these participants as a typical market participant  and third  we adjust the fair premium amount for a typical market participant to account for the difference between the non performance or default risk of a typical market participant and the non performance or default risk of a financial guarantor of similar credit quality to us in each case  we refer to the risk of non performance as non performance risk 
defining the equivalent risk tranche direct observations of fair premium amounts for our transactions are not available since these transactions cannot be traded or transferred pursuant to their terms and there is currently no active market for these transactions 
however  cds on tranches of a standardized index the cdx index are widely traded and observable  and provide relevant market data for determining the fair premium amount of our transactions  as described more fully below 
the cdx index is a synthetic corporate cdo that comprises a list of corporate obligors and is segmented into multiple tranches of synthetic senior unsecured debt of these obligors ranging from the equity tranche ie  the most credit risk or first loss position to the most senior tranche ie  the least credit risk 
we refer to each of these tranches as a standard cdx tranche 
a tranche is defined by an attachment point and detachment point  representing the range of portfolio losses for which the protection seller would be required to make a payment 
our corporate cdo transactions possess similar structural features to the standard cdx tranches  but often differ with respect to the referenced corporate entities  the term  the attachment points and the detachment points 
therefore  in order to determine the equivalent risk tranche for each of our corporate cdo transactions  we determine the attachment and detachment points on the cdx index that have comparable estimated probabilities of loss as the attachment and detachment points in our transactions 
we begin by performing a simulation analysis of referenced entity defaults in our transactions to determine the probability of portfolio losses exceeding our attachment and detachment points 
the referenced entity defaults are primarily determined based on the following inputs the market observed cds credit spreads of the referenced corporate entities  the correlations between each of the referenced corporate entities  and the term of the transaction 
for each referenced corporate entity in our corporate cdo transactions  the cds spreads associated with the term of our transactions credit curve define the estimated expected loss for each entity as applied in a market standard approach known as risk neutral modeling 
the credit curves on individual referenced entities are generally observable 
the expected cumulative loss for the portfolio of referenced entities associated with each of our transactions is the sum of the expected losses of these individual referenced entities 
with respect to the correlation of losses across the underlying reference entities  two obligors belonging to the same industry or located in the same geographical region are assumed to have a higher probability of defaulting together ie  they are more correlated 
an increase in the correlations between the referenced entities generally causes a higher expected loss for the portfolio associated with our transactions 
the estimated correlation factors that we use are derived internally based on observable third party inputs that are based on historical data 
the impact of our correlation assumptions currently does not have a material effect on our fair premium estimates in light of the significant impact of our non performance risk adjustment as described below 
once we have established the probability of portfolio losses exceeding the attachment and detachment points in our transactions  we then use the same simulation method to locate the attachment and detachment points on the cdx index with comparable probabilities 
these equivalent attachment and detachment points define the equivalent risk tranche on the cdx index that we use to determine fair premium amounts 

table of contents determining the typical fair premium amount the equivalent risk tranches for our corporate cdo transactions often are not identical to any standard cdx tranches 
as a result  fair premium amounts generally are not directly observable from the cdx index for the equivalent risk tranche and must be separately determined 
we make this determination through an interpolation in which we use the observed premium rates on the standard cdx tranches that most closely match our equivalent risk tranche to derive the typical fair premium amount for the equivalent risk tranche 
non performance risk adjustment on corporate cdos the typical fair premium amount estimated for the equivalent risk tranche represents the fair premium amount for a typical market participant not radian 
accordingly  the final step in our fair value estimation is to convert this typical fair premium amount into a fair premium amount for a financial guarantor of similar credit quality to us 
a typical market participant is contractually bound by a requirement that collateral be posted regularly to minimize the impact of that participant s default or non performance 
this collateral posting feature makes these transactions less risky to the protection buyer  and therefore  priced differently 
none of our contracts require us to post collateral with our counterparties  which exposes our counterparties fully to our non performance risk 
we make an adjustment to the typical fair premium amount to account for both this contractual difference  as well as for the market s perception of our default probability which is observable through our cds spread 
the amount of the non performance risk adjustment is computed based  in part  on the expected claim payment by radian 
to estimate this expected payment  we first determine the expected claim payment of a typical market participant by using a risk neutral modeling approach 
a significant underlying assumption of the risk neutral model approach that we use is that the typical fair premium amount is equal to the present value of expected claim payments from a typical market participant 
expected claim payments on a transaction are based on the expected loss on that transaction also determined using the risk neutral modeling approach 
radian s expected claim payment is calculated based on the correlation between the default probability of the transaction and our default probability 
the default probability of radian is determined from the observed radian group cds spread  and the default probability of the transaction is determined as described above under defining the equivalent risk tranche 
the present value of radian s expected claim payments is discounted using a risk free interest rate  as the expected claim payments have already been risk adjusted 
the reduction in our fair premium amount related to our non performance risk is limited to a minimum fair premium amount  which is determined based on our estimate of the minimum fair premium that a market participant would require to assume the risks of our obligations 
our non performance risk adjustment currently results in a material reduction of our typical fair premium amounts  which in turn has a positive impact on the fair value of these derivatives 
non corporate cdos and other derivative transactions our non corporate cdo transactions include our guaranty of trups cdos  cdos of abs  cdos of cmbs  and cdos backed by other asset classes such as i municipal securities  ii synthetic financial guarantees of abs  and iii project finance transactions 
the fair value of our non corporate cdos and other derivative transactions is calculated as the difference between the present value of the expected future contractual premiums and our estimate of the fair premium amount for these transactions 
the present value of expected future contractual premiums is determined based on the methodology described above for corporate cdos 
for our credit card transactions  the fair premium amount is estimated using observed spreads on recent trades of securities that are similar to the securities that we guaranty 
in all other instances  we utilize internal models to estimate the fair premium amount as described below 
these credit derivatives are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
trups cdos our trups transactions are cds on cdos where the collateral consists primarily of deeply subordinated securities issued by banks  insurance companies  real estate investment trusts and other financial institutions whose individual spreads are not observable 
in each case  we provide credit protection on a specific tranche of each cdo 
we use a discounted cash flow valuation approach to determine fair value for these 
table of contents transactions that captures the credit characteristics of each transaction 
we estimate projected claims based on our internal credit analysis  which is based on the current performance of each underlying reference obligation 
the present value of the expected cash flows to the trups transaction is then determined using a discount rate derived from the observed market pricing for a trups transaction with similar characteristics 
the present value of the insured cash flows is determined using a discount rate that is equal to our cds rate plus a risk free rate 
for certain of our trups transactions  our counterparties may require that we pay them the outstanding par on the underlying trups bond if an event of default has occurred and remains outstanding as of the termination date of our cds coverage a conditional liquidity claim 
for these transactions  an additional fair value adjustment is made 
to calculate this adjustment  a probability that we will be required to pay a conditional liquidity claim is assigned based on our internal cash flow projections  which provides us with information as to the likelihood of the existence of a conditional liquidity claim 
a discounted cash flow valuation is also performed for this scenario where we are required to make a conditional liquidity claim 
the fair value is set equal to the probability weighted average of the valuations from the two scenarios one in which our counterparty makes a conditional liquidity claim and one in which the claim is not made 
cdos of abs  including related vie liabilities the fair value amounts for our cdos of abs transactions are derived using standard market indices and discounted cash flows  to the extent expected losses can be estimated 
for one cdo of abs transaction  the credit quality of the underlying referenced obligations was reasonably similar to that which was included in the aaa rated abx 
he index  a standardized list of rmbs reference obligations 
accordingly  the fair premium amount for a typical market participant for this transaction was derived directly from the observed spreads of this index 
this transaction matured during prior to january   our guaranty on our sole outstanding directly insured cdo of abs transaction was accounted for as a derivative 
upon the adoption of the accounting standard update regarding improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involving vies  we determined that we are the primary beneficiary for this cdo of abs transaction and consolidated the vie assets and liabilities as of january  upon consolidation  we elected the fair value option for all financial assets and financial liabilities held by this vie  which primarily consist of trading securities  interest rate swaps and vie debt to note holders in the trust 
the fair value election results in a net fair value of the vie assets and vie liabilities that is equal to the fair value liability of our exposure as previously accounted for as a derivative 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the primary beneficiary analysis and the related financial impact to our financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
the investment securities in this consolidated cdo of abs transaction have experienced significant credit deterioration 
fair value for these securities is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
we estimate cash flows for the transaction based on our internal credit analysis  which is based on the current performance of each security 
the present value of the expected cash flows from the securities is then determined using a discount rate derived from the bbb abx 
he index 
the present value of the insured cash flows which represents the vie debt is determined using a discount rate that is equal to our cds rate plus a risk free rate 
we continue to utilize this model to estimate the fair value of our exposure  and to derive the fair value of this consolidated vie debt 
the vie debt and derivative liability within this cdo of abs transaction are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
our maximum principal exposure to loss from this cdo of abs transaction is million at december  the recorded net fair value of our consolidated assets and liabilities related to this consolidated cdo of abs as of december   was less than our maximum principal exposure 
the fair value of the vie debt and other liabilities exceeds the net value of the assets of the vie  however  because our fair value estimate of the vie debt incorporates a discount rate that is based on our cds spread  the fair value is substantially less than our expected ultimate claim payments 

table of contents cdos of cmbs the fair premium amounts for our cdos of cmbs transactions for a typical market participant are derived first by observing the spreads of the cmbx indices that match the underlying reference obligations of our transactions 
a mezzanine tranche  which represents our insured tranche  is then priced through a standard cdo model 
the cmbx indices represent standardized lists of cmbs reference obligations 
a different cmbx index exists for different types of underlying referenced obligations based on vintages and credit rating 
for each of our cdos of cmbs transactions  we use the cmbx index that most directly correlates to our transaction with respect to vintage and credit rating 
because the observable cmbs indices do not have a similar mezzanine tranche  we use an internal cdo pricing model in order to adjust fair value for this structural feature 
a standard cdo pricing model was calibrated to establish the market pricing at inception 
this cdo pricing model is then applied to the current valuation period to derive the fair premium for the mezzanine tranche 
the typical fair premium amount represents the estimated fair value of the expected future fair premiums determined by using a discount rate equal to the cds spread of a typical market participant plus a risk free rate 
all other non corporate cdos and other derivative transactions for all of our other non corporate cdos and other derivative transactions  observed prices and market indices are not available 
as a result  we utilize an internal model that estimates fair premium 
the fair premium amount is calculated such that the expected profit fair premium amount net of expected losses and other expenses is proportional to an internally developed risk based capital amount 
expected losses and our internally developed risk based capital amounts are projected by our model using the credit rating  term  and current par outstanding for each transaction 
for each of the non corporate cdos and other derivative transactions discussed above  with the exception of cdos of abs and trups transactions that are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis  we make an adjustment to the fair premium amounts as described above under non performance risk adjustments on corporate cdos to incorporate our own non performance risk 
the non performance risk adjustment associated with our cdos of abs and our trups transactions is incorporated in the fair value as described above  therefore  no separate adjustment is required 
these credit derivatives are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
assumed financial guaranty credit derivatives in making our determination of fair value for assumed credit derivatives  we use information provided to us by our counterparties to these reinsurance transactions  which are the primary insurers the primaries of the underlying credits  including the primaries fair valuations for these credits 
the information obtained from our counterparties is not received with sufficient time for us to properly record the mark to market liability as of the balance sheet date 
therefore  the amount recorded as of december   is based on the most recent available financial information  which is reported on a quarterly lag 
the lag in reporting is consistent from period to period 
the fair value is based on credit spreads obtained by the primaries from market data sources published by third parties eg  dealer spread tables for collateral similar to assets within the transactions being valued as well as collateral specific spreads provided by trustees or obtained from market sources if such data is available 
if observable market spreads are not available or reliable for the underlying reference obligations  then the primaries valuations are predominantly based on market indices that most closely resemble the underlying reference obligations  considering asset class  credit quality rating and maturity of the underlying reference obligations 
in addition  these valuations incorporate an adjustment for non performance risk 
the primaries models used to estimate the fair value of these instruments include a number of factors  including credit spreads  changes in interest rates and the credit ratings of referenced entities 
in establishing our fair value for these transactions  we assess the reasonableness of the primaries valuations by reviewing the primaries publicly available information regarding their mark to market processes  including methodology and key assumptions  and analyzing and discussing the changes in fair value with the primaries where the changes appear unusual or do not appear materially consistent with credit loss related information when provided by the primaries for these transactions 
these credit derivatives are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 

table of contents other financial guaranty vie consolidated assets liabilities upon the adoption of the accounting standard update regarding improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involving vies  we determined that we are the primary beneficiary for two vies in addition to our cdo of abs transaction as of january   for which we have provided financial guarantees 
upon consolidation  we elected the fair value option for all financial assets and financial liabilities held by these two vies  which primarily consist of manufactured housing loans and vie debt to note holders in the trust 
the fair value election allows us to offset the changes in fair value of the assets and liabilities of the trust  providing a better representation of our net exposure to the vies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the primary beneficiary analysis and the related financial impacts to our financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
the fair value of the vie debt related to these other financial guaranty vies is estimated based on prices of comparable securities and spreads observed in the market 
the overall net fair value for these transactions is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
we do not currently estimate any projected claims based on our internal credit analysis  which is based on the current performance of the underlying collateral and the remaining subordination available to support the transaction 
the present value of the insured cash flows is determined by using a discount rate that is equal to our cds rate plus a risk free rate 
we utilize this model to determine the fair value of our exposure to these vies  and to derive the fair value of the assets in these vies  which are reported within other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
the assets and vie debt related to these transactions are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
our maximum principal exposure to loss from these transactions is million  however  we do not currently expect to pay any claims related to these two vies 
at december   we recorded million of other assets  million of vie debt and million of accounts payable and accrued expenses associated with these two vies 
mortgage insurance international and domestic cds in determining the estimated fair value of our mortgage insurance international and domestic cds  we used the following information non binding fair value quotes from our counterparties on each respective transaction  which are based on quotes for transactions with similar underlying collateral from market makers and other broker dealers  and in the absence of observable market data for these transactions  a review of quarterly information regarding the performance of the underlying collateral and discussion with our counterparties regarding any unusual or inconsistent changes in fair value 
in either case  in the event there were material inconsistencies in the inputs to determine estimated fair value  they were reviewed and a final determination was made by management in light of the specific facts and circumstances surrounding each price 
we made an adjustment to the fair value amount described above to incorporate our own non performance risk 
the amount of the adjustment was computed based on the correlation between the default probability of the transaction and our default probability as described more fully under non performance risk adjustments on corporate cdos 
prior to their termination  our cds transactions were categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
in december  we terminated our remaining mortgage insurance international cds and in the second quarter of  we terminated our remaining mortgage insurance domestic cds 
investments we group assets in our investment portfolio into one of three main categories held to maturity  available for sale or trading securities 
fixed maturity securities for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
investments in securities not classified as held to maturity or trading securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses net of tax reported as a separate component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
investments classified as trading securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of income 
beginning in the second quarter of  we classified all security purchases as trading securities 
short term investments consist of assets invested 
table of contents in money market instruments  certificates of deposit and highly liquid  interest bearing instruments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase 
amortization of premium and accretion of discount are calculated principally using the interest method over the term of the investment 
realized gains and losses on investments are recognized using the specific identification method 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the fair value of investments  and investment policy and portfolio in item for more information on our investment portfolio 
for certain hybrid financial instruments that would be required to be separated into a host contract and a derivative instrument  the accounting standard regarding derivatives and hedging permits an entity to irrevocably elect to initially and subsequently measure that hybrid financial instrument in its entirety at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
we elected to record our convertible securities meeting these criteria at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as net gains or losses on other financial instruments 
all hybrid financial instruments are classified trading securities 
on april   we adopted a new accounting standard regarding recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments otti 
in accordance with this new standard  we record an other than temporary impairment on a security if we intend to sell the impaired security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis  or we expect to be unable to collect cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of the security 
if a sale is likely  the security is classified as other than temporarily impaired and the full amount of the impairment is recognized as a loss in the statement of operations 
otherwise  losses on securities which are other than temporarily impaired are separated into i the portion of loss which represents the credit loss  and ii the portion which is due to other factors 
the credit loss portion is recognized as a loss in the statement of operations  while the loss due to other factors is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of taxes 
a credit loss is determined to exist if the present value of discounted cash flows expected to be collected from the security is less than the cost basis of the security 
the present value of discounted cash flows is determined using the original yield of the security 
for securities held as of april  that had previously been other than temporarily impaired  an after tax transition adjustment of million was booked to reclassify the non credit loss portion of these impairments from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consider several factors  including  but not limited to  the following the extent and the duration of the decline in value  the reasons for the decline in value eg  credit event  interest related or market fluctuations  the financial position and access to capital of the issuer  including the current and future impact of any specific events  and the financial condition of and near term prospects of the issuer 
vies effective january   we adopted the accounting standard update regarding improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involving vies 
as a provider of credit enhancement  we have entered into insurance contracts with vies and derivative contracts with counterparties where we have provided credit protection directly on variable interests and  in some cases  obtained the contractual rights of our counterparties with respect to the vies 
as defined by the accounting standard  vies include corporations  trusts or partnerships in which equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk to finance activities without additional subordinated financial support 
in addition  as a result of the update to the standard regarding accounting for transfers of financial assets  effective january   special purpose entities that were previously considered qspes are to be considered in the vie accounting framework as prescribed by the standard regarding financial reporting by enterprises involving vies 

table of contents an entity is considered the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate a vie if its variable interest i gives it the power to most significantly impact the economic performance of the vie  and ii has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie 
for all vies in which we have a variable interest  we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary  a number of factors are considered  including the structure of the entity  contractual provisions that grant us additional rights to influence or control the economic performance of the vie upon the occurrence of an event of default or a servicer termination event or the breach of a performance trigger  and our obligation to absorb significant losses 
due to the continued deterioration of the performance of many of our financial guaranty transactions  the breach of these performance tests or other events giving rise to our right to influence or control the economic performance of the vie could occur 
when we obtain control rights  we perform an analysis to reassess our involvement with these vies to determine whether we have become the primary beneficiary 
when evaluating whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we determine which activities most significantly impact the economic performance of the vie 
as part of our qualitative analysis  we consider whether we have any contractual rights that would allow us to direct those activities 
as of december   we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of our nims transactions  our cps transactions and certain financial guaranty structured transactions 
as a result of the adoption of this accounting standard  in addition to the vies we had consolidated prior to january   we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of two additional vies with respect to which we provided credit protection pursuant to financial guaranty insurance contracts and one additional vie with respect to which we provided credit protection pursuant to a financial guaranty derivative contract 
while the implementations of this accounting standard impacted the classification of our assets  liabilities  and certain line items in our statement of operations  we recorded no transition adjustments at january   because the net liabilities associated with these transactions remained unchanged 
our control rights in these vies  which we obtained due to an event of default or breach of a performance trigger as defined in the transaction  generally provide us with either a right to replace the vie servicer  or  in some cases  the right to direct the sale of the vie assets 
in those instances where we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary  we consolidate the assets and liabilities of the vie 
we have elected to carry the financial assets and financial liabilities of these vies at fair value 
income taxes we provide for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of the accounting standard regarding accounting for income taxes 
as required under this standard  our deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized under the balance sheet method  which recognizes the future tax effect of temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax bases of these amounts 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled 
as of december   before consideration of our valuation allowance  we had a net dta in the amount of million 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance against our dta when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our dta will not be realized 
at each balance sheet date  we assess our need for a valuation allowance and this assessment is based on the relative impact of all available evidence  both positive and negative  and requires management to exercise judgment and make assumptions regarding the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence and whether the dta will be realized in future periods 
future realization of our dta will ultimately depend on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character ordinary income versus capital gains within the applicable carryback and carryforward periods provided under the tax law 
the primary sources of negative evidence considered are our cumulative losses in recent years  and the increased uncertainty around our future operating results 
we also consider several sources of positive evidence when assessing the need for a valuation allowance such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future projections of taxable income  taxable income within the applicable carryback periods  and any potential tax planning strategies 
in making our assessment of the more 
table of contents likely than not standard  the weight assigned to the effect of both negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
in accordance with the accounting standard regarding the accounting and disclosure of income taxes in interim periods  we use an annualized effective tax rate to compute our tax expense each quarter 
we adjust this annualized effective tax rate each quarter by the following discrete items i net gains or losses resulting from the change in fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments  ii investment gains or losses  iii the liabilities recorded under the accounting standard regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  and iv prior year provision to filed tax return adjustments 
given the uncertainty of the impact these discrete items will have for the full year  which directly affects our ability to estimate our pre tax income or loss and the associated effective tax rate at each quarterly period  we believe it is appropriate to treat these items discretely when developing our effective tax rate each quarter 
future changes in these discrete items during the year will impact our annualized effective tax rate 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an update to the accounting standard regarding fair value measurements and disclosures 
this update requires new disclosures regarding significant transfers in and out of level i and level ii fair value measurements for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  additional disclosures regarding the reconciliation of level iii fair value measurements are not required until effective january   we adopted the update to the accounting standard regarding accounting for transfers of financial assets 
this update is intended to improve the relevance and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a transfer of financial assets  the effects of a transfer on its financial position  financial performance  and cash flows  and a transferor s continuing involvement in transferred financial assets 
specifically  this update removes the concept of a qspe from the accounting standard related to the accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities and removes the exception from applying the accounting standard related to the consolidation of vies 
enhanced disclosures are required to provide financial statement users with greater transparency about transfers of financial assets and a transferor s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets 
see vies above for a description regarding the impact of this adoption 
effective july   we adopted the update to the accounting standard regarding derivatives and hedging 
this update clarifies how to determine whether embedded credit derivatives  including those interests held in collateralized debt obligations and synthetic collateralized debt obligations  should be bifurcated and accounted for separately 
the adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued an update to the accounting standard regarding disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
the objective of this update is to provide financial statement users with information that will enable them to understand the nature of credit risk inherent in the creditor s portfolio of financing receivables  the way credit risk is analyzed in arriving at the allowance for credit losses  and the changes in the allowance for credit losses and reasons for the changes 
the new disclosures required by this update are effective for interim and annual periods ending after december  the new requirements did not have a significant impact on our disclosures  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued an update to the accounting standard regarding accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts 
this update redefines acquisition costs as costs that are related directly to the successful acquisition of new  or the renewal of existing  insurance contracts 
currently  acquisition costs are defined as costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of insurance contracts 
the impact of this revised definition of acquisition costs may result in additional expenses being 
table of contents charged to earnings immediately rather than being deferred 
this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  management is currently evaluating the impact that may result from the adoption of this standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the value of financial instruments as a result of changes in market conditions 
examples of market risk include changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit spreads and equity prices 
we perform  on an annual basis  a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects of market risk exposures on our investment securities and certain financial guaranty contracts 
this analysis is performed by determining the potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit spreads and equity prices 
our sensitivity analysis for interest rates and credit spreads is generally calculated as a parallel shift in yield curve with all other factors remaining constant 
in addition  on a quarterly basis  we review changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit spreads and equity prices to determine whether there has been a material change in our market risk since that presented in connection with our annual sensitivity analysis 
interest rate risk the primary market risk in our investment portfolio is interest rate risk  namely the fair value sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates 
we regularly analyze our exposure to interest rate risk  and we have determined that the fair value of our interest rate sensitive investment assets is materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
we estimate the changes in fair value of our fixed income securities by projecting an instantaneous increase and decrease in interest rates 
the carrying value of our total investment portfolio at december  and  was billion and billion  respectively  of which and  respectively  was invested in fixed income securities 
we calculate duration of our fixed income securities  expressed in years  in order to estimate interest rate sensitivity of these securities 
at december   a basis point increase in interest rates would reduce the market value of our fixed income securities by million  while a basis point decrease in interest rates would increase the market value of our fixed income securities by million 
at december   the average duration of the fixed income portfolio was years 
credit risk we provide credit protection in the form of cds and other financial guaranty contracts that are marked to market through earnings 
with the exception of nims  these financial guaranty derivative contracts generally insure obligations with considerable subordination beneath our exposure at the time of issuance 
the underlying asset classes of these obligations include corporate entities  abs  rmbs  cmbs  and trups 
with the exception of nims  one cdo of abs and our insured trups cdos all of which are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis  the value of our financial guaranty derivative contracts are affected predominantly by changes in credit spreads of the underlying obligations 
as credit spreads and ratings change  the value of these financial guaranty derivative contracts change and the resulting gains and losses are recorded in our operating results 
in addition  with the adoption of the accounting standard regarding fair value measurements  we have incorporated the market s perception of our non performance risk into the market value of our derivative instruments 
we have determined that the fair value of our cds and other financial guaranty contracts is materially exposed to changes in credit spreads  including our own credit spread 
sensitivity to changes in credit spreads can be estimated by projecting a hypothetical instantaneous shift in credit spread curves 
the following table presents the pre tax change in the fair value of our insured derivatives
