critical accounting estimates disclosure of codorus valley s significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements of this form k 
some of these policies require management to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
management makes significant estimates in determining the allowance for loan losses  valuation of foreclosed real estate  and evaluation of other than temporary impairment losses of securities 
management considers a variety of factors in establishing allowance for loan losses such as current economic conditions  diversification of the loan portfolio  delinquency statistics  results of internal loan reviews  financial and managerial strength of borrowers  adequacy of collateral  if collateral dependent  or present value of future cash flows and other relevant factors 
foreclosed real estate is initially recorded at fair value minus estimated costs to sell at the date of foreclosure  establishing a new cost basis 
appraisals are generally used to determine fair value 
after foreclosure  management reviews valuations at least quarterly and adjusts the asset to the lower of cost or fair value minus estimated costs to sell 
estimates related to the value of collateral can have a significant impact on whether or not management continues to accrue income on delinquent and impaired loans and on the amounts at which foreclosed real estate is recorded on the statement of financial condition 
the corporation records its available for sale securities portfolio at fair value 
fair values for these securities are determined based on methodologies in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  and as clarified by several fasb staff positions 
fair values for debt securities are volatile and may be influenced by any number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates  credit ratings and yield curves 
fair values for debt securities are based on quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments or an estimate of fair value by using a range of fair value estimates in the market place as a result of the illiquid market specific to the type of security 
when the fair value of a debt security is below its amortized cost and depending on the length of time the condition exists and the extent the fair value is below amortized cost  additional analysis is performed to determine whether an other than temporary impairment condition exists 
debt securities are analyzed quarterly for possible other than temporary impairment 
the analysis considers whether the corporation has the intent to sell its debt securities prior to market recovery or maturity and whether it is more likely than not that the corporation will be required to sell its debt securities prior to market recovery or maturity 
often  information available to conduct these assessments is limited and rapidly changing  making estimates of fair value subject to judgment 
if actual information or conditions are different than estimated  the extent of the impairment of the debt security may be different than previously estimated  which could have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations and financial condition 
management discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates and related management discussion and analysis disclosure with the audit committee 
with the exception of the change in how we computed the historical loan loss rate for two industries in connection with our evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance as described in note under the subheading allowance for loan losses  there were no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented within this report 
additional information is contained in management s discussion and analysis regarding critical accounting estimates  including the provision and allowance for loan losses  located on pages and of this report 
overview executive summary constrained by a weak economy  we were able to achieve several notable financial accomplishments for the current year  which included doubling net income available to common shareholders  growing core deposits excluding certificates of deposit  increasing the net interest margin from percent to percent  and increasing the corporation s risk weighted capital ratios 
also during the year we began implementing a companywide client relationship management system crm after years of planning 
in this regard  we appointed a crm director to manage the process  assigned responsibilities  formed teams and purchased a reputable crm software system 
implementation and personnel training for this large undertaking are expected to be completed in we believe that a properly managed crm process  coupled with a client focused operating philosophy  will improve the corporation s competitiveness  client service and retention  and shareholder value 
in spite of the earnings improvement for the year  earnings remained constrained due to credit quality issues and a lack of loan demand resulting from the challenging economic climate  the high level of unemployment and depressed real estate markets 
for the second consecutive year  the provision for loan losses remained elevated which reflected the upward trend in net charge offs 
increased carrying costs and losses on impaired loans and foreclosed real estate also served to dampen earnings 
the commercial loan portfolio balance decreased slightly less than one percent at year end  after two previous years of strong growth  due to a lack of demand  which was typical for the financial services industry 
with the exception of residential mortgage refinances  demand for consumer loans was also tepid 
total deposits at year end increased percent as a result of our competitive pricing policy and client preference for the safety and liquidity provided by fdic insured deposit products 
during  funds from deposit growth were largely invested in investment securities  principally us agency mortgage backed instruments and municipal bonds 
noninterest income  excluding gains from the sale of investment securities  increased as a result of increases in service fees on deposits and revenue from our wealth management operation 
the latter is comprised of trust and advisory fees and income from mutual fund  annuity and insurance sales 
in the period ahead  management will remain focused on profitable balance sheet growth  acquiring and nurturing client relationships  risk management and possible expansion of the banking franchise 
we anticipate economic weakness  both nationally and locally  for and beyond 
risks and uncertainties include prolonged weakness in economic and business conditions  which could increase credit related losses  possible declines in the market value of investment securities considered to be other than temporary  a relatively high level of unemployment  erosion of real estate values and possible adverse economic impacts caused by global events 
financial highlights vs 
the corporation earned net income available to common shareholders of  or per share  basic and diluted  for  compared to  or per share  basic and diluted  for the  or percent increase in net income available to common shareholders was primarily the result of an increase in net interest income and a decrease in the provision for loan losses  which more than offset increases in noninterest expense and income tax expense 
the  or percent increase in net interest income for was the result of an increase in earning assets and a decrease in the average rates paid on deposit products  which reflected record low short term market interest rates 
an increase in the yield on floating rate commercial loans  due to the imposition of a minimum rate that began in the prior year  also contributed 
these factors improved the net interest margin  which was percent for  compared to percent for the provision for loan losses for decreased  or percent compared to the provision in the prior year included the impact of a large provision for an impaired real estate loan that was later transferred to the foreclosed real estate portfolio 
the  or percent increase in noninterest expense for was primarily the result of increased carrying costs and impairment losses on foreclosed real estate compared to the  increase in the provision for income taxes for compared to was primarily the result of a significant increase in pretax income 
additionally  the prior year included a  tax benefit associated with restructuring employee benefit plans 
total assets were approximately million at december   an increase of million or percent above december  asset growth occurred primarily in the investment securities portfolio as the demand for loans diminished in response to the prolonged economic slowdown  depressed real estate markets and the high rate of unemployment 
in contrast  deposit growth remained steady throughout the year as investors sought the liquidity and safety of fdic insured deposit products 
annual cash dividends per common share totaled for  compared to for book value per share was for year end  compared to for year end net income as a percentage of average total assets return on assets or roa  was percent for  compared to percent for net income as a percentage of average shareholders equity return on equity or roe  was percent for  compared to percent for the favorable increases in the roa and roe ratios for reflected the increase in net income 
the efficiency ratio noninterest expense as a percentage of net interest income plus noninterest income on a tax equivalent basis was percent for  compared to percent for the favorable decrease in the efficiency ratio was the result of the significant increase in net interest income 
at december   nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and net foreclosed real estate was percent  compared to percent at year end the corporation s net loan charge offs ratio was percent for the period ended december   compared to percent for the period ended december  charge offs during the current period pertained primarily to commercial real estate loans that were reserved for in prior periods 
information regarding nonperforming assets is provided in the risk management section of this report  including table nonperforming assets 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was percent for year end and percent for year end information regarding the allowance is provided in the risk management section of this report  including tables analysis of allowance for loan losses and allocation of allowance for loan losses 
based on a recent evaluation of probable loan losses and the current loan portfolio  we believe that the allowance is adequate to support losses inherent in the portfolio at december  throughout  the corporation maintained a capital level above minimum regulatory quantitative requirements 
currently  there are three federal regulatory definitions of capital that take the form of minimum ratios 
table capital ratios  shows that the corporation and peoplesbank were well capitalized on december  vs 
comparatively  the corporation earned net income available to common shareholders of  or per share  basic and diluted  for  compared to  or per share diluted earned in the  or percent decrease in net income available to common shareholders was primarily the result of increases in the provision for loan losses  noninterest expenses and preferred dividends  which offset increases in net interest income and noninterest income and a decrease in income taxes 
the  or percent increase in the provision for loan losses for was the result of additions to the allowance for impaired commercial real estate loans and significant growth in the loan portfolio 
allocations to the allowance were deemed necessary due to continued uncertainty in the economy  depressed real estate values and an increase in the level of nonperforming loans 
the  or percent increase in noninterest expense for was due primarily to an increase in operating expenses associated with expansion of the banking franchise  an increase in federal deposit insurance corporation fdic deposit insurance premiums  and an increase in carrying costs and loss provisions associated with impaired loans and foreclosed real estate 
during  the corporation absorbed the full year s cost impact of adding three financial centers in the prior year 
expansion of the banking franchise was successful and all of the new offices generated loan and deposit volumes that exceeded management s expectations 
in  fdic insurance premiums totaled  an increase of  or percent above of the total insurance premiums   pertained to a special fdic assessment effective june   which was imposed on all commercial financial institutions based on an fdic assessment formula 
the remaining increase in deposit insurance premiums was caused by an industry wide increase in assessment rates by the fdic and an increase in the volume of deposits upon which the assessment is based 
carrying costs and loss provisions associated with impaired loans and foreclosed real estate increased  above the prior year  which reflected increases in the volume of impaired loans and foreclosed real estate 
a  non recurring cost of restructuring employee benefit plans in also contributed to the increase in noninterest expense 
restructuring the benefit plans resulted in a federal income tax benefit so that the overall transaction had an insignificant impact on net income 
net interest income for was  an increase of  or percent above due to a larger volume of earning assets  principally commercial loans and investment securities 
the net interest margin was percent for  compared to percent for total noninterest income was  for  an increase of  or percent above the increase in noninterest income was primarily attributable to increases in gains from the sale of mortgages and investment securities  and income from bank owned life insurance 
the provision for income taxes for was a  credit benefit  compared to a  expense for the decrease in income tax was the result of a decrease in pretax income  an increase in tax exempt income and the recognition of a non recurring  tax benefit associated with restructuring employee benefit plans 
on december   total assets were approximately million  an increase of million or percent above december  asset growth occurred primarily in the commercial loans and investment securities portfolios  which were funded primarily by an increase in deposits generated from local markets and  to a lesser degree  borrowing from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh 
the increase in investment securities and borrowings were the result of an million leverage strategy employed to offset the costs of dividends on preferred stock issued to the us treasury under the treasury s capital purchase program 
a more detailed analysis of the factors and trends affecting earnings follows 
income statement analysis net interest income the corporation s principal source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investment securities  and interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowed funds 
fluctuations in net interest income are caused by changes in interest rates  volumes and the composition or mix of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
unless otherwise noted  the discussion that follows is based on interest income and interest expense as reported in the consolidated statements of income  not on a tax equivalent basis 
net interest income for was  an increase of  or percent above the increase was primarily the result of an increase in the average volume of earnings assets and a decrease in the average rates paid on deposit products  which reflected record low short term market interest rates 
an increase in yield on floating rate commercial loans  due to the imposition of a minimum rate that began in the prior year  also contributed 
these factors improved the net interest margin  which was percent  compared to percent for net interest margin is net interest income tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
for  total interest income increased  or percent  above due primarily to an increase in the average volume of earning assets and the increase in yield on floating rate commercial loans as described earlier 
earnings assets averaged million and yielded percent tax equivalent basis for the current period  compared to million and percent  respectively  for the million or percent increase in the average volume of earning assets was primarily the result of increases in investment securities and to a lesser degree  commercial loans 
with the exception of mortgage refinancing  the demand for commercial and consumer loans diminished in in response to the prolonged economic slowdown  depressed real estate markets and the high rate of unemployment and job insecurity 
for  total interest expense decreased  or percent  below the level due to a decrease in the average rates paid on deposits 
total interest bearing liabilities averaged million at an average rate of percent  compared to million and percent  respectively  for the million or percent increase in average interest bearing liabilities was primarily the result of increases in the average volume of money market and time deposits 
deposit growth reflected our competitive rates and customer preference for the liquidity and safety of fdic insured deposit products 
comparatively  for  net interest income increased  or percent above the level 
the increase was primarily the result of an increase in the average volume of earnings assets 
the net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  was percent  compared to percent for the decrease in the net interest margin reflected many factors  which included the low level of market interest rates  which depressed yields on floating rate loans  overnight investments and investment securities  an elevated level of nonperforming assets  excess liquidity  and the impact of the leverage strategy implemented earlier in the year 
during the second half of  we responded to the low interest rate environment by imposing interest rate floors on commercial loans  which helped to increase the net interest margin for the remainder of the year 
earning assets averaged million and yielded percent tax equivalent basis for  compared to million and percent  respectively  for the million or percent increase in the average balance of earning assets was primarily the result of strong growth in the commercial loan and investment securities portfolios 
the increase in commercial loans reflected additions to the business banking staff and changes in the competitive landscape that benefited the corporation 
the increase in investment securities  principally us agency mortgage backed bonds and tax exempt municipals bonds  resulted from the leverage strategy  which is discussed in the investment securities section of this report 
the leverage strategy made a positive contribution to net interest income  however  the two percent tax equivalent margin spread resulting from this strategy constrained the corporation s net interest margin 
total interest bearing liabilities averaged million at an average rate of percent  compared to million and percent  respectively  for the million or percent increase in average interest bearing liabilities was the result of increases in the average volume of time deposits  money market deposits and long term debt 
the addition of three financial centers in and competitive pricing also contributed to the increase in deposit volumes for the increase in long term debt provided the financing for the leverage strategy  which is discussed in the long term debt section of this report

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is an expense charged to earnings to cover estimated losses attributable to uncollectible loans 
the provision reflects management s judgment of an appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses 
the risk management section of this report  including tables nonperforming assets  analysis of allowance for loan losses  and allocation of allowance for loan losses provides detailed information about the allowance  provision and credit risk 
for  the provision was  compared to  for and  for the current period provision supported heightened risks and uncertainties associated with prolonged weakness in economic and business conditions  a relatively high level of unemployment  further erosion of real estate values and a relatively large portfolio of impaired commercial loans 
the provision for included a large provision for an impaired commercial real estate loan that was later transferred to the foreclosed real estate portfolio where it currently resides pending its ultimate sale 
noninterest income the following table presents the components of total noninterest income for each of the past three years 
a key operating strategy is to increase noninterest or fee based income by offering new services  enhancing traditional services and expanding sales into new geographic markets 
table noninterest income dollars in thousands trust and investment services fees income from mutual fund  annuity and insurance sales service charges on deposit accounts income from bank owned life insurance other income gain on sales of loans held for sale gain on sales of securities total noninterest income the increase in total noninterest income for was  or percent above the prior year level 
core noninterest income  which excludes the gain on sales of securities  increased approximately  or percent 
the discussion that follows explains changes in noninterest income 
trust and investment services fees increases in income for and were primarily the result of appreciation in market value of managed accounts  upon which some fees are based  and growth in the settlement advisory business 
income from mutual fund  annuity and insurance sales the  or percent increase in income during was due primarily to increases in income from brokerage and advisory service product lines  which were driven by market value appreciation and increased sales 
the decrease in income for compared to was a result of depressed capital markets and the impact it had on the volume of sales and fees 
a portion of our fees are calculated on market prices of assets under management 
significant capital market losses during the latter part of through the first quarter of made many investors risk adverse  resulting in a decline in the demand for capital based products 
service charges on deposit accounts the  or percent increase in service charges on deposit accounts during was due primarily to an increase in debit card revenue  which reflected an increase in the volume of transactions 
possible restrictions by the federal government may significantly reduce debit card revenue ie  interchange fees and overdraft fees beginning in the banking industry  through the american bankers association  is waging a national campaign to contest these proposed governmental price controls 
income from bank owned life insurance boli income for was flat compared to as low market interest rates depressed yields 
the  increase in income for compared to reflected the full years impact of an additional million investment in november and an increase in the crediting rates on existing policies that were transferred to new insurance providers 
the additional investment in boli during provides a competitive tax free return to the corporation while providing a life insurance benefit to additional members of the management team 
other income the  or percent increase in other income was due primarily to a one time  gain from the sale of a bank branch property and an increase in fees from merchant credit card services 
gain on sales of loans held for sale the  or percent decrease in gain from the sale of mortgage loans during reflected a decrease in the volume of loan sales 
sales in were unusually high compared to due to the favorable impact of the federal first time home buyer tax credit program that expired in april mortgage banking activity  principally the refinancing of residential mortgages  was stimulated as a result of low market interest rates during the years and gain on sales of securities gains from the sale of fixed income securities from the available for sale securities portfolio are recognized periodically to take advantage of a low market interest rate environment and to supplement earnings

the discussion that follows addresses changes in noninterest expense 
personnel for year  personnel expense  comprised of wages  sales commissions  payroll taxes and employee benefits  increased  or percent above due to an increase in employee health care insurance costs and normal business growth 
effective august   peoplesbank converted from a fully insured health care program to a self insured program by joining a consortium of approximately banks 
for the first year under the new program peoplesbank will fund the maximum liability based on recent claims experience  which is expected to result in an increase in health care costs 
thereafter  the benefits of the self insured program are expected to contain future health care cost increases over the long term 
employees have customarily reimbursed the corporation for approximately percent of the cost of health insurance 
comparatively  the increase of  or for year resulted primarily from the full year s effect of staff additions associated with expansion of the banking franchise in during  peoplesbank added three full service financial centers  one in the first quarter and two in the fourth quarter of that year 
a non recurring cost of  in the first quarter of incurred to restructure employee benefit plans also contributed to the increase in personnel expense 
however  restructuring the benefit plans resulted in a federal income tax benefit so that the overall transaction had an insignificant impact on net income 
occupancy of premises  net the  or percent increase in occupancy of premises expense  comprised of rent  depreciation  maintenance  insurance  real estate taxes and utilities  was due primarily to the addition of a lease associated with the relocation of a branch banking office to a more favorable site and normal business growth 
furniture and equipment the cost of furniture and equipment expense for year was approximately the same as comparatively  the  or percent increase for year above was primarily the result of an increase in depreciation expense from capital expenditures that supported franchise expansion and information technology initiatives 
during the third quarter of  peoplesbank began implementing a client relationship management crm system with estimated completion in the capital outlay for this project is estimated at  which does not include staffing and other ancillary expenses 
when the system becomes operational it will be depreciated over a five year useful life 
a properly managed crm process is expected to improve the corporation s competitiveness  client service and retention  and shareholder value 
postage  stationery and supplies the  or percent increase during was evenly divided between increases in postage and supplies due in part to normal business growth 
postage costs pertaining to the mailing of required compliance correspondence and promotional advertisements also contributed to the increase 
professional and legal the  or percent increase was primarily in the consulting expense component  which reflected the use of consultants for special projects such as the crm initiative and information technology and for outsourcing selected internal audits 
marketing and advertising the  or percent increase in marketing expense was due primarily to a larger budget  which included expenditures for branding and product advertising 
fdic insurance the  or percent decrease in federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance premiums for year was the result of a special assessment totaling  included in operations 
on an adjusted basis  fdic premiums increased  or percent above primarily as a result of deposit growth 
comparatively  the  increase for year above was the result of an industry wide increase in assessment rates  an increase in the volume of deposits upon which the assessment is based  and the imposition of an industry wide special assessment  which totaled  for peoplesbank 
the purpose of the rate increases and the special assessment june by the fdic was to provide a temporary means of funding its depleted deposit insurance fund 
as required under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  the fdic plans to change the quarterly assessment calculation for determining deposit insurance premiums effective april  at that time the fdic plans to lower assessment rates and apply them against average assets minus average tangible capital  instead of domestic deposits 
we anticipate that this change will be favorable for peoplesbank and will decrease its deposit insurance premium 
a recalculation of premium for fourth quarter annualized under the new assessment guidelines suggests an annual cost savings of approximately  more information about fdic insurance assessments is available under the supervision and regulation section of this report reference the subheading fdic 
debit card processing annual increases in debit card processing expense were primarily the result of increases in the number of new accounts and transaction volume 
this expense category also includes the cost of operating automated teller machines 
charitable donations the level of charitable donations for and included the impact of increased educational and scholarship donations  among others  that qualified for state tax credits ranging in size from to percent of the amount of the donation 
state tax credits of approximately  and  were accrued in and  respectively  and used to reduce pennsylvania share tax expense  included in the other expense category 
telephone the  or percent increase for year reflected normal business growth and a  final settlement to resolve a billing dispute pertaining to telecommunication service in prior years 
comparatively  the  or percent increase in telephone expense for reflected one time conversion costs to a new carrier  telecommunication enhancements and expansion of the banking franchise 
during  the corporation s telecommunications carrier abruptly declared bankruptcy  which temporarily disrupted service and resulted in disputes pertaining to the validity of billing charges 
a portion of the increase in telephone expense pertained to catch up billings from the prior year from the replacement telecommunications carrier 
foreclosed real estate including gains losses on sales the  or percent increase in foreclosed real estate expense was due in part to loss reserves totaling  established for two unrelated properties 
recent appraisals by independent appraisers indicated deterioration in the value of these properties 
in addition  maintenance and repairs and other pre leasing costs totaled  for a third property that is in the process of renovation for tenant use under a lease agreement 
carrying costs associated with foreclosed real estate typically include insurance  maintenance and repairs  real estate taxes  appraisals and legal fees 
impaired loan carrying costs the  or percent increase during reflected increased carrying costs  particularly real estate taxes and legal fees  associated with selected loans pursuant to the loan workout process 
other the  or percent decrease in other expense for year  which is comprised of many underlying expenses  was primarily the result of a  or percent decrease in pennsylvania shares tax 
the level of shares tax was low for the years and in due to the accrual of state tax credits  which originated from charitable donations  as described above 
income taxes the provision for income tax for year was  compared to a  credit benefit for the increase in income tax was primarily the result of an increase in pretax income 
for both periods  the corporation s statutory federal income tax rate was percent 
the corporation s effective income tax rate was approximately percent for  compared to a benefit rate of percent for the effective tax rate for resulted from a  tax benefit associated with benefit plan restructuring and the relatively low level of pretax income 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due to the impact of low income housing credits and tax exempt income  including income from bank owned life insurance 
balance sheet review overnight investments overnight investments  comprised of interest bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold  totaled million on december   compared to million on december  the level of overnight investment at year end reflected an increase in investable funds from deposit growth  which exceeded the corporation s investment in loans and securities 
investment securities the investment securities portfolio is an interest earning asset  second in size to the loan portfolio 
investment securities serve as an important source of revenue and liquidity 
they also serve as collateral for public and trust deposits  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and to support borrowings 
the investment securities portfolio is managed to comply with the corporation s investment securities policy  and accounted for in accordance with fasb asc topic decisions to purchase or sell securities are based on an assessment of current economic and financial conditions  including the interest rate environment  the demand for loans  and liquidity and income requirements

the increase in the investment securities portfolio for was primarily the result of implementing an million leverage strategy that involved investing in investment grade us agency mortgage backed bonds year average lives and tax exempt municipal bonds year maturities  which were financed by borrowing from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh 
the leverage strategy  which was completed in april  generated an approximately two percent tax equivalent margin spread  which covers the dividends payable and related costs associated with the issuance of preferred stock described in the shareholders equity and capital adequacy section of this report 
during and  peoplesbank took advantage of the low interest rate environment and sold primarily us agency mortgage backed bonds  which generated net gains of  and  respectively  that were recognized in income 
included in the gain for was a small gain from the sale of the final million par value corporate trust preferred security  which represented an obligation of the bank of america 
securities available for sale are generally comprised of high quality debt instruments 
included in table are investments in the obligations of states and municipalities  which have recently received negative press because of widespread budget deficits and  by implication  the possibility of default 
we believe that selected investment in municipal bonds is a sound investment practice 
municipalities have many options for meeting their debt obligations  including decreasing costs and service levels  imposing taxes and selling assets 
in many cases  municipal debt issues are insured or in the case of school districts of selected states  backed by specific reserves  which provide a layer of protection to the investor 
access to the credit market and a good credit rating are high priorities of municipal management enabling it to meet its current and future funding needs at a reasonable interest cost 
for these reasons  defaults on municipal bonds are very low  well below percent 
with the exception of an approximately million portfolio fair value of texas municipal utility district bonds  which has its own criteria for investment  the remaining municipal bonds are almost all rated a or above by at least one national rating service at december  the majority of bonds in our portfolio are general obligation bonds  which can draw upon multiple sources of revenue  including taxes  for payment 
only a few bonds are revenue bonds  which are dependent upon a single revenue stream for payment  but they are for critical services such as sewer and water 
many of the municipal holdings are also insured or backed by specific school district reserves 
table securities maturity schedule  shows that the available for sale portfolio had a yield of percent on december  this compares to percent on december  the decrease in portfolio yield for was the result of security additions  including the reinvestment of cash inflows from scheduled maturities and repayments of mortgage backed bonds  during a period of unusually low market interest rates and asset yields

in contrast  for year end  commercial related loans increased million or percent above year end the increase was due in part to an increase in the business banking staff and the addition of two business banking offices in maryland during commercial loan portfolio growth was also positively impacted in prior years by changes in the competitive landscape caused by the acquisition of local competitors by larger financial institutions headquartered outside of our market area

at december   peoplesbank had approximately million of collateralized borrowing availability at the discount window  and no outstanding borrowing 
on december  and  short term borrowings  comprised solely of repo agreements  totaled million and million  respectively 
long term debt is a secondary funding source for asset growth 
on december   long term debt totaled million  compared to million at year end the decrease was attributable to payments for maturing fhlbp loans throughout that were not refinanced 
generally  funds for the payment of long term debt come from operations 
on december   total unused credit with the fhlbp was approximately million 
obligations to the fhlbp are secured by fhlbp stock and qualifying collateral  principally the unpledged portion of peoplesbank s investment securities portfolio and qualifying loan receivables  principally mortgage loans 
a listing of outstanding long term debt obligations is provided in note short term borrowings and long term debt 
during  peoplesbank borrowed approximately million in term debt from the fhlbp to partially affect a leverage strategy 
maturities were staggered over three years at an average rate of percent 
peoplesbank borrowed from the fhlbp to finance investments in securities to generate sufficient net interest spread to cover the cost of the dividends payable on the preferred stock issued in january as described below in the shareholders equity and capital adequacy section 
shareholders equity and capital adequacy shareholders equity or capital enables the corporation to maintain asset growth and absorb losses 
capital adequacy can be affected by a multitude of factors  including profitability  corporate expansion  balance sheet growth  dividend policy  and regulatory mandates  among others 
total shareholders equity was million on december   compared to million for year end the increase in equity was created through an increase in retained earnings from profitable operations 
as previously reported  on january   the corporation sold  shares of  liquidation value par value nonvoting cumulative perpetual preferred stock to the us department of the treasury treasury under the treasury s voluntary capital purchase program cpp and received million in capital funds 
codorus valley  which is well capitalized  has been using the capital to sustain loan growth plans and to strengthen its capital base against economic uncertainties 
the preferred stock  which qualifies as tier capital  is generally redeemable at any time in whole or in part in a qualified offering ie  a minimum of percent of the issue price with regulatory permission 
the dividend on the preferred stock is percent per annum for the first five years  and percent thereafter and is paid quarterly 
under the cpp  the corporation was also required to issue a warrant option to the treasury to allow the treasury to purchase  shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of per share subject to adjustment for stock dividends  splits  etc the year warrant can be exercised by the treasury at any time on or before january  the allocation of the million of proceeds between the preferred stock and the warrant is provided in note shareholders equity 
the cpp places restrictions on the ability of participating institutions  without obtaining permission from the treasury  to increase dividends and repurchase the corporation s common stock 
the cpp also places restrictions on incentive compensation to senior executives 
the annual after tax cost of the preferred stock is approximately   in dividends plus  for the average implied cost of the warrant  which is charged to retained earnings 
management initiated an million leverage strategy to generate sufficient income to offset costs associated with the dividends payable on the preferred stock 
the leverage strategy  which was completed in april  involved borrowing from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh and investing the proceeds in investment grade securities to achieve a two percent net interest margin 
the corporation anticipates that it will apply for participation in the treasury s small business lending fund sblf in the first quarter of a summary of the sblf can be found under the supervision and regulation section of this report by referencing the small business jobs and credit act of management plans to request million in capital  of which million would be used to refinance  with applicable regulatory approvals  all of the outstanding preferred stock issued under the treasury s cpp 
there are no immediate plans to repurchase the outstanding common stock warrant issued under the cpp 
funds from the sblf will be used primarily to support increased lending to creditworthy small businesses 
the sblf provides an attractive opportunity to the corporation to obtain tier capital  lower the dividend rate and to remove restrictions associated with the capital purchase program 
the corporation typically pays cash dividends on a quarterly basis 
the board of directors determines the dividend rate after considering the corporation s capital requirements  current and projected net income  and other factors 
annual cash dividends per common share totaled for  compared to for the level of dividends for both years reflected our focus on preserving capital in response to economic uncertainty and earnings and credit quality challenges 
on january   the board declared a regular cash dividend of per share  payable on or before february   to shareholders of record on january  the corporation s participation in the us department of the treasury s capital purchase program cpp requires regulatory approval to increase quarterly cash dividends on common stock above cents per share 
the cents per share cap represents the dividend that was paid just prior to the corporation s participation in the cpp 
as disclosed in this report  the corporation maintains various employee  director and shareholder benefit plans that could result in the issuance of its common stock or affect its earnings 
information regarding these plans can be found in note benefit plans and note stock based compensation to the consolidated financial statements 
the corporation and peoplesbank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulators that involve quantitative guidelines and qualitative judgments

risk management the corporation s risk management committee committee meets at least quarterly and includes members of senior management and an independent director 
the objective of the committee is to identify and manage risk inherent in the operations of the corporation and its affiliates 
while the committee s risk review is broad in scope  its primary responsibility is to develop  implement and monitor compliance with formal risk management policies and procedures 
credit risk management credit risk represents the possibility that a loan client  counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms  posing one of the most significant risks of loss to the corporation 
accordingly  the corporation emphasizes the management of credit risk 
to support this objective a sound lending policy framework has been established 
this framework includes seven basic policies that guide the lending process and minimize risk 
first  the corporation follows detailed written lending policies and procedures 
second  lending authority is granted commensurate with dollar amount  loan type  level of risk  and loan officer experience 
third  loan review committees function at both the senior lending officer level and the board level to review and approve loans that exceed pre established dollar thresholds and or meet other criteria 
fourth  the corporation lends mainly within its primary geographical market area  york county  pennsylvania and northern maryland 
although this focus may pose a geographical concentration risk  the diverse local economy and employee knowledge of customers lessens this risk 
fifth  the loan portfolio is diversified to prevent dependency upon a single customer or small group of related customers 
sixth  the corporation does not participate in the subprime lending market  nor does it invest in securities backed by subprime mortgages 
and seventh  the corporation does not lend to foreign countries or persons residing therein 
the corporation uses loan to value ratios ltv ratios  establishing generally acceptable ratios of the loan amount to the value of the collateral securing the loan  to minimize the risk of loss from the loan portfolio 
at december   the ltv ratios listed below were in effect 
loan type ltv ratio residential  owner occupied units  tax assessment residential  owner occupied units  certified appraisal residential  non owner occupied units  certified appraisal residential  or more units agricultural commercial industrial vacant land depending on improvements  approvals an acceptable valuation is required on all real estate secured loans 
generally  an appraisal performed by an independent licensed appraiser is required for real estate secured loans where the amount is above  or is non owner occupied  or if the ltv ratio is above percent for commercial property or above percent of the tax assessed value for owner occupied residential property 
exceptions to ltv ratios and the use of a licensed appraiser are sometimes made by management or the board of directors when there are compensating factors 
one component of the internal credit risk review is the identification and management of industry concentrations  defined as greater than percent of the total loan portfolio 
at year end and  the corporation had two industry concentrations that exceeded percent of the total loan portfolio builders developers was and percent of the portfolio  respectively  and commercial real estate investor was and percent of the portfolio  respectively 
loans to borrowers within these industries are usually collateralized by real estate 
in addition to a comprehensive lending policy  numerous internal reviews of loan and foreclosed real estate portfolios occur throughout the year 
loan portfolios are also reviewed by independent auditors in connection with their annual financial statement audit and are examined periodically by bank regulators 
nonperforming assets the following table presents a five year history of asset categories posing the greatest risk of loss and related ratios 
management generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest income when loan payment performance is unsatisfactory and or the loan is past due days or more 
loans past due days or more and still accruing interest are contractually past due  but well collateralized and in the process of collection 
the final category  foreclosed real estate  is real estate acquired to satisfy loans owed to peoplesbank 
the paragraphs below explain significant changes in the aforementioned categories for december   compared to december nonperforming assets are reviewed by management each month 
management generally relies on appraisals performed by independent licensed appraisers to determine the value of impaired  collateral dependent loans 
in instances where the value of the collateral minus estimated selling costs is less than the net carrying amount of the loan  a loss allowance is established for that difference by recording a loss provision to the income statement 
when it is probable that some portion or all of the loan balance will not be collected that portion is charged off as loss against the allowance 
generally  loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current  has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time  generally six months  and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt

nonaccrual loans on december   nonaccrual loans consisted of collateralized commercial and residential mortgage loans  and consumer loans 
the nonaccrual loan portfolio balance totaled  on december   a decrease of  or percent  compared to year end the decrease resulted primarily from the reclassification of several nonaccrual loans to foreclosed real estate and  to a lesser degree  payments by borrowers 
on december   the nonaccrual loans portfolio was comprised of twenty unrelated accounts ranging in size from  to  five unrelated commercial loan accounts  which represent percent of the total nonaccrual loan portfolio balance  are described below 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at least quarterly and have established a loss allowance for selected accounts where the net realizable value of the collateral is insufficient to repay the loan 
collection efforts  including modification of contractual terms for individual accounts based on prevailing market conditions and liquidation of collateral assets  are being employed to maximize recovery 
further provisions for loan losses may be required on nonaccrual loans when additional information becomes available or conditions change or as required by bank regulators 
loan no 
peoplesbank owns a percent participation loan interest  and its share of the outstanding principal balance of the loan is  the collateral supporting this out of market loan is a acre parcel of improved real estate  which is zoned commercial use 
in december  the borrower abruptly ceased operation and declared bankruptcy 
as of december  we established a  loss allowance for this account based on the results of an independent appraisal of the primary property supporting this loan 
we are presently in the process of evaluating the value of the remaining collateral  the repayment capacity of the guarantors  and our recovery options 
loan no 
peoplesbank owns a percent participation loan interest  and its share of the outstanding principal balance of the loan is  the collateral supporting the loan is approximately acres of undeveloped land  which is zoned mixed office 
based on a recent appraisal of the real estate  we believe that the loan is adequately collateralized 
we may also rely on the personal guarantors of the loan  if necessary  for payment 
loan no 
the outstanding principal loan balance is  this account is collateralized by three acres of improved real estate located in a major commercial district  a small parcel of improved real estate and the assignment of a personal loan from a third party whose payments are current

loan no 
peoplesbank owns an approximately percent participation loan interest and its share of the outstanding principal balance of the loan is  the original collateral supporting the loan was an unit condominium building 
as a result of unit sales  the borrower has reduced the principal amount of peoplesbank s share of the loan by  during the borrower is presently attempting to liquidate the remaining units 
for  the gross interest income that would have been recorded if the nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and current throughout the period was approximately  the amount of interest income on those nonaccrual loans that was included in net income for was approximately  the interest income recognized on impaired loans  which includes nonaccrual loans  in note loan quality is a lesser amount because it includes interest income only from the time the loan was impaired 
foreclosed real estate on december   foreclosed real estate  net of allowance  totaled  compared to  at december  during  five foreclosed commercial properties were fully liquidated with a carrying value of  which resulted in the recognition of a net gain totaling  the net gain was included in foreclosed real estate expense 
also during that period  other properties were partially liquidated and several properties were added to the foreclosed real estate portfolio as indicated below 
on december   the portfolio was comprised of eight unrelated accounts ranging in size from  to  which we are actively attempting to liquidate 
if a valuation allowance for possible loss was established for a particular property it is so noted in the property description below 
further valuation allowances may be required on any foreclosed property as additional information becomes available or conditions change 
foreclosed real estate is included in the other assets category on the corporation s balance sheet 
five unrelated foreclosed real estate properties  which represent percent of the total foreclosed real estate portfolio balance  are described below

potential problem loans on december   there were approximately million in potential problem loans closely monitored by management 
potential problem loans consist of loans classified as substandard where we have doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms  and which are not disclosed in table a loss allowance totaling  was established at december   for those potential problem commercial loans that  in our judgment  were inadequately collateralized 
comparatively  we were monitoring approximately million in potential problem loans at december  allowance for loan losses although the corporation maintains sound credit policies  certain loans deteriorate and must be charged off as losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and is reduced by loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
the allowance is based upon management s continuous evaluation of the loan portfolio coupled with a formal review of adequacy on a quarterly basis  which is subject to review and approval by the board 
an overview of the methodology and key factors that we use in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance and loan impairment is provided in note of this report 
determining the level of the allowance for probable loan losses at any given period is difficult  particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods 
we must make estimates using assumptions and information which are often subjective and fluid 
table analysis of allowance for loan losses presents an analysis of the activity in the allowance for loan losses over a five year period 
a more detailed analysis of the allowance for the current year is provided in note of this report 
table allocation of allowance for loan losses presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by major loan category 
during  the analysis of adequacy of the allowance was refined to better measure risks associated with quantitative and qualitative risk factors applied to pooled industry segments 
as a result  the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses decreased for december   compared to prior years 
generally  the unallocated component for years ended and reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the loan portfolio 
the allowance was  or percent of total loans  on december   compared to  and percent  respectively  on december  the increase in the allowance reflects credit quality issues for selected commercial real estate loans and was based on our estimate of the amount necessary to bring the allowance to a level reflective of the risk in the loan portfolio 
we considered macro economic factors that could adversely affect the ability of peoplesbank s loan clients to repay their loans  including the high level of unemployment and the probable continuation of a downturn in the commercial real estate market 
based on our evaluation of probable loan losses in the current portfolio  we believe that the allowance is adequate to support losses inherent in the loan portfolio on december  table analysis of allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands balance beginning of year provision charged recovery credited to operating expense loans charged off commercial  industrial  and agricultural real estate construction and land development real estate residential and home equity consumer total loans charged off recoveries commercial  industrial  and agricultural real estate residential and home equity consumer total recoveries net recoveries charge offs balance end of year ratios net recoveries charge offs as a of average total loans allowance for loan losses as a of total loans allowance for loan losses as a of nonaccrual loans and loans past due days or more the trend of increased loan charge offs reflects prolonged weak economic conditions and the effects they had on our commercial borrowers

furthermore  the portion allocated to each loan category is not the total amount available for future losses that might occur within such categories since the total allowance is a general allowance applicable to the entire loan portfolio 
liquidity maintaining adequate liquidity provides the corporation with the ability to meet financial obligations to depositors  loan customers  employees  and shareholders on a timely and cost effective basis in the normal course of business 
additionally  it provides funds for growth and business opportunities as they arise 
liquidity is generated from transactions relating to both the corporation s assets and liabilities 
the primary sources of asset liquidity are scheduled investment security maturities and cash inflows  funds received from customer loan payments  and asset sales 
the primary sources of liability liquidity are deposit growth  short term borrowings and long term debt 
the consolidated statements of cash flows  included in this report  present the changes in cash from operating  investing and financing activities 
at year end  we believe that liquidity was adequate based upon the potential liquidation of unpledged available for sale securities with a fair value totaling approximately million and available credit from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh totaling approximately million 
the corporation s loan to deposit ratio was percent for year end  compared to percent for year end the decrease in the ratio was the result of deposit growth outpacing loan growth in off balance sheet arrangements the corporation s financial statements do not reflect various commitments that are made in the normal course of business  which may involve some liquidity risk 
these commitments consist primarily of commitments to grant new loans  unfunded commitments under existing loan facilities  and letters of credit issued under the same standards as on balance sheet instruments 
financial instruments with off balance sheet risk are disclosed in note commitments to extend credit of this report and totaled million at december   compared to million at december  normally these commitments have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and are for specific purposes 
accordingly  many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn and therefore  generally do not present significant liquidity risk to the corporation or peoplesbank 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and  therefore  differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation may impact the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation may also significantly affect noninterest expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
the level of inflation can be measured by the change in the consumer price index cpi for all urban consumers december vs 
december 
the change in the cpi for was percent  compared to percent for and percent for management believes that the most significant impact on financial results is the corporation s ability to react to changes in market interest rates 
management strives to structure the balance sheet to increase net interest income by managing interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to reprice in response to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  management is focused on increasing fee income  an income component that is less sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable to smaller reporting companies 
report of management s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting the corporation carried out an evaluation  under the supervision and with the participation of the corporation s management  including the corporation s chief executive officer and chief financial officer  of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures  as defined in exchange act rules a e and d e 
based upon the evaluation  the corporation s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that  as of december   the corporation s disclosure controls and procedures are effective 
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the corporation s reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission s rules and forms 
the management of the corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
the corporation s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
management assessed the effectiveness of the corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of december   using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control integrated framework  with an emphasis on internal control over financial reporting guidance for smaller public companies  also issued by coso 
based on this assessment  management concluded that  as of december   the corporation s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 
this annual report does not include an attestation report of the corporation s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting as no such report is required 
management s report was not subject to attestation by the corporation s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the securities and exchange commission that permit the corporation to provide only management s report in this annual report
