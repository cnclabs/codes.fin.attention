item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements the information set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below includes forward looking statements as described in the section forward looking statements preceding part i of this annual report on form k  and is subject to the safe harbor created by section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks faced by us and described in item a 
risk factors in part i and other sections of this report and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements beginning january   we began applying the provisions of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and fasb asu no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
we also retrospectively applied these provisions to our historical financial statements presented herein 
no changes to previously reported amounts in the historical financial statements were required as a result of retrospective application of these standards 
overview and executive summary we design  develop  manufacture  market and service high performance computing  or hpc  systems  commonly known as supercomputers  and provide engineering services related to hpc systems and solutions 
our supercomputer systems provide capability and sustained performance far beyond typical server based computer systems and address challenging scientific  engineering and national security computing problems 
we believe we are well positioned to meet the hpc market s demanding needs by providing superior supercomputer systems with performance and cost advantages when sustained performance on challenging applications and total cost of ownership are taken into account 
we differentiate ourselves from our competitors primarily by concentrating our research and development efforts on the interconnect network  packaging  system software capabilities and processing capabilities that enable our systems to provide efficient and high sustained performance at scale that is  that enable our systems to continue to increase performance as they grow in size 
purpose built for the supercomputer market  our higher end systems balance highly capable processors  very dense design  highly scalable system software and very high speed interconnect and communications capabilities 
our current plans are based on gaining market share in the high end supercomputer market segment  extending our technology leadership  maintaining our focus on execution and profitability and expanding our addressable market through broadening of our engineering services offerings  specifically our custom engineering practices  and selling our cray xem systems 
summary of results revenue increased by million in compared to  with a million increase in product revenue partially offset by a million decrease in service revenue 
the increase in product revenue was principally due to the release of the cray xe systems in and increased custom engineering external storage sales as part of our data management practice 
the decrease in service revenue was primarily due to our inability to record revenue on a custom engineering contract in for services that were performed but where not all revenue recognition criteria had been met 
the company recorded income from operations of million in compared to a loss from operations of million in total gross profit increased million in from due to higher product revenue which was partially offset by lower service revenue and lower service gross profit 
operating expenses decreased million due primarily to lower net research and development expenses which resulted from higher reimbursements  principally from our darpa hpcs phase iii program  and lower outside service expenses 

table of contents net cash used in operations during was million  as compared to net cash provided by operations of million in the increase in net cash used in operations was principally due to an increase in accounts receivable due to the issuance of large value invoices late in the fourth quarter  associated with acceptances  due in early market overview and challenges significant trends in the hpc industry include the commoditization of hpc hardware  particularly processors and interconnect systems  the growing commoditization of software  including plentiful building blocks and more capable open source software  supercomputing with many core commodity processors driving increasing scalability requirements  electrical power requirements becoming a design constraint and driver in total cost of ownership determinations  increased micro architectural diversity  including many core processors and growing experimentation with accelerators  as the rate of per core performance increases slows  and data needs growing faster than computational needs 
several of these trends have resulted in the expansion and acceptance of lower bandwidth cluster systems using processors manufactured by intel  amd and others combined with commercially available commodity networking and other components  particularly in the middle and lower segments of the hpc market 
these systems may offer higher theoretical peak performance for equivalent cost  and price peak performance is often the dominant factor in hpc procurements outside of the high end supercomputer market segment 
vendors of such systems often put pricing pressure on us in competitive procurements 
in the markets for the largest systems  those costing significantly in excess of million  the use of commodity processors and networking components can result in increasing data transfer bottlenecks as these components do not balance processor power with network communication capability 
with the arrival of increasing processor core counts due to new many core processors  these unbalanced systems will typically have even lower productivity  especially in larger systems running more complex applications 
we and other vendors have also begun to augment standard microprocessors with other processor types  such as field programmable gate arrays and graphics processing units  in order to increase computational power  further complicating programming models 
in addition  with increasing scale  bandwidth and processor core counts  large computer systems use progressively higher amounts of power to operate and require special cooling capabilities 
to position ourselves to meet the market s demanding needs  we concentrate our research and development efforts on the interconnect  system and programming environment software and packaging capabilities that enable our supercomputers to perform at scale that is  to continue to increase actual performance as systems grow ever larger in size 
we also have demonstrated expertise in several processor technologies 
further  we offer unique capabilities in high speed  high bandwidth system interconnect design  compiler technology  system software and packaging capabilities 
we believe our experience and capabilities across each of these fronts are becoming ever more important  especially in larger procurements 
we expect to be in a comparatively advantageous position as larger many core processors become available and as multiple processing technologies become integrated into single systems in heterogeneous environments 
in addition  we intend to expand our addressable market by leveraging our technologies and customer base  the cray brand and industry trends by introducing complementary products and services to new and existing customers  as demonstrated by our emphasis on custom engineering projects and the introduction of our cray xem system 

table of contents key performance indicators our management monitors and analyzes several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance  including revenue 
product revenue generally constitutes the major portion of our revenue in any reporting period and  for the reasons discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  is subject to significant variability from period to period 
in the short term  we closely review the status of product shipments  installations and acceptances in order to forecast revenue and cash receipts  longer term  we monitor the status of the pipeline of product sales opportunities and product development cycles 
product revenue growth is an indicator of whether we are achieving our objective of increased market share in the supercomputing market 
the introduction of the cray xe family and our longer term product roadmap are efforts to increase product revenue 
we also plan to increase our engineering services offerings  specifically with our custom engineering initiative  and market new products  such as the cray xem and successor systems  to increase revenue 
maintenance service revenue is more constant in the short term and assists  in part  to offset the impact that the variability in product revenue has on total revenue 
gross profit margin 
our product gross profit margin increased slightly from in to in service gross profit margin decreased from in to in the decrease in service gross profit margin is due to our investment in custom engineering in advance of revenue and our inability to record revenue on a custom engineering contract in for services that were performed but where not all revenue recognition criteria had been met 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses are driven largely by headcount  the level of recognized co funding for research and development and contracted third party research and development services 
as part of our ongoing efforts to control operating expenses  we monitor headcount levels in specific geographic and operational areas 
operating expenses for were million less than due primarily to higher co funding reimbursement amounts under our darpa hpcs program and reduction in certain non recurring outside services for research and development expenses compared to decreased net research and development expenses were partially offset by increases of million in sales and marketing expenses and a million increase in general and administrative expenses primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense 
liquidity and cash flows 
due to the variability in product revenue and new contracts  our cash position also varies significantly from quarter to quarter and within a quarter 
we closely monitor our expected cash levels  particularly in light of increased inventory purchases for large system installations and the risk of delays in product shipments and acceptances and  longer term  in product development 
cash receipts often lag customer acceptances and  because we had a number of large customer acceptances in the fourth quarter of  we anticipate large cash inflows in the first quarter of critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
in preparing our financial statements in accordance with gaap  there are certain accounting policies that are particularly important 
these include revenue recognition  inventory valuation  income taxes  research and development expenses and share based compensation 
we believe these accounting policies and others set forth in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item exhibits and financial statement schedules in part iv of this annual report should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
in some cases  these policies represent required accounting 
in other cases  they may represent a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation 
additionally  we consider certain judgments and estimates to be significant  including those relating to the estimated selling price determination used in revenue recognition  percentage of completion accounting  
table of contents estimates of proportional performance on co funded engineering contracts and prepaid engineering services  determination of inventory at the lower of cost or market  useful lives for depreciation and amortization  determination of future cash flows associated with impairment testing of long lived assets  determination of the fair value of stock options and other assessments of fair value  calculation of deferred income tax assets  including our ability to utilize such assets  potential income tax assessments and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions 
our management has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped or services provided to the customer  risk of loss has transferred to the customer  and a customer acceptance has been obtained 
the sales price is not considered to be fixed or determinable until all material contingencies related to the sales have been resolved 
the company records revenue in the consolidated statements of operations net of any sales  use  value added or certain excise taxes imposed by governmental authorities on specific sales transactions 
in addition to the aforementioned general policy  the following are the company s statements of policy with regard to multiple element arrangements and specific revenue recognition policies for each major category of revenue 
multiple element arrangements 
the company commonly enters into revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables of its product and service offerings due to the needs of its customers 
product may be delivered in phases over time periods which can be as long as five years 
maintenance services generally begin upon acceptance of the first equipment delivery and future deliveries of equipment generally have an associated maintenance period 
the company considers the maintenance period to commence upon acceptance of the product  which may include a warranty period and accordingly allocates a portion of the arrangement consideration as a separate deliverable which is recognized as service revenue over the entire service period 
other services such as training and engineering services can be delivered as a discrete delivery or over the term of the contract 
a multiple element arrangement is separated into more than one unit of accounting if the following criteria are met the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in the control of the company 
if these criteria are not met  the arrangement is accounted for as one unit of accounting which would result in revenue being recognized ratably over the contract term or being deferred until the earlier of when such criteria are met or when the last undelivered element is delivered 
if these criteria are met for each element  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit s relative estimated selling price 
the company follows a selling price hierarchy in determining the best estimate of the selling price of each deliverable 
certain products and services are sold separately in standalone arrangements for which the company is sometimes able to determine vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe 
the company determines vsoe based on normal pricing and discounting practices for the product or service when sold separately 
when the company is not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in an arrangement with multiple elements  the company attempts to establish the selling price of each remaining element based on third party evidence  or tpe 
the company s inability to establish vsoe is often due to a relatively small sample of customer contracts that differ in system size and contract terms which can be due to infrequently selling each element separately  not pricing products within a narrow range  or only having a limited sales history  such as in 
table of contents the case of certain advanced and emerging technologies 
tpe is determined based on our prices or competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
on certain transactions the company is able to obtain competitor prices for comparable bundled arrangements 
however  generally  the company s offerings contain a significant level of customization and differentiation from those of competitors such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
the company is also often unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a standalone basis as important details of competitive bids are not available 
therefore  the company is typically not able to determine tpe 
when the company is unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  the company uses estimated selling price  or esp  in its allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which the company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis 
in determining esp  the company uses either the list price of the deliverable less a discount or the cost to provide the product or service plus a margin 
when using list price less a discount  the company uses discounts from list price for previous transactions 
this approach incorporates several factors  including the size of the transaction and any changes to list prices 
the data is collected from prior sales  and although the data may not have the sample size or consistency to establish vsoe  it is sufficiently objective to estimate the selling price 
when using cost plus a margin  the company considers the total cost of the product or service  including customer specific and geographic factors 
the company also considers the historical margins of the product or service on previous contracts and several factors including any changes to pricing methodologies  competitiveness of products and services and cost drivers that would cause future margins to differ from historical margins products 
the company recognizes revenue from sales of products  other than the cray cx systems  upon customer acceptance of the system  when the price is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and no significant unfulfilled obligations exist 
revenue from sales of cray cx systems is generally recognized upon shipment when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
services 
maintenance services are provided under separate maintenance contracts with customers 
these contracts generally provide for maintenance services for one year  although some are for multi year periods  often with prepayments for the term of the contract 
the company considers the maintenance period to commence upon acceptance of the product  which may include a warranty period 
when service is part of a multiple element arrangement  the company allocates a portion of the arrangement consideration to maintenance service revenue based on estimates of selling price 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract 
maintenance contracts that are billed in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
revenue from engineering services is recognized as services are performed 
project revenue 
revenue from design and build contracts is recognized under the percentage of completion  or poc method 
under the poc method  revenue is recognized based on the costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated costs to fulfill the contract 
if circumstances arise that change the original estimates of revenues  costs  or extent of progress toward completion  revisions to the estimates are made 
these revisions may result in increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs  and such revisions are recorded in income in the period in which the circumstances that gave rise to the revision become known by management 
the company performs ongoing profitability analyses of its contracts accounted for under the poc method in order to determine whether the latest estimates of revenue  costs and extent of progress require updating 
if at any time these estimates indicate that the contract will be unprofitable  the entire estimated loss for the remainder of the contract is recorded immediately 
the company records revenue from certain research and development contracts which include milestones using the milestone method if the milestones are determined to be substantive 
a milestone is considered to be substantive if management believes there is substantive uncertainty that it will be achieved and the milestone consideration meets all of the following criteria it is commensurate with either of the following the company s performance to achieve the milestone  or 
table of contents the enhancement of value of the delivered item or items as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the company s performance to achieve the milestone 
it relates solely to past performance 
it is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms including other potential milestone consideration within the arrangement 
the individual milestones are determined to be substantive or nonsubstantive in their entirety and milestone consideration is not bifurcated 
revenue from projects is classified as product revenue or service revenue  based on the nature of the work performed 
inventory valuation we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly evaluate the technological usefulness and anticipated future demand for our inventory components 
due to rapid changes in technology and the increasing demands of our customers  we are continually developing new products 
additionally  during periods of product or inventory component upgrades or transitions  we may acquire significant quantities of inventory to support estimated current and future production and service requirements 
as a result  it is possible that older inventory items we have purchased may become obsolete  be sold below cost or be deemed in excess of quantities required for production or service requirements 
when we determine it is not likely we will recover the cost of inventory items through future sales  we write down the related inventory to our estimate of its market value 
because the products we sell have high average sales prices and because a high number of our prospective customers receive funding from us or foreign governments  it is difficult to estimate future sales of our products and the timing of such sales 
it also is difficult to determine whether the cost of our inventories will ultimately be recovered through future sales 
while we believe our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and that our estimates and assumptions to determine any adjustments to the cost of our inventories are reasonable  our estimates may prove to be inaccurate 
we have sold inventory previously reduced in part or in whole to zero  and we may have future sales of previously written down inventory 
we also may have additional expense to write down inventory to its estimated market value 
adjustments to these estimates in the future may materially impact our operating results 
during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million related to inventory in excess of estimated future demand 
the largest portion of this write down related to a cray custom made component used on the cray xt systems known as the cray seastar interconnect purchased in under a last time buy procurement 
accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided when we estimate that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized through future operations 
this assessment is based upon consideration of available positive and negative evidence  which includes  among other things  our recent results of operations and expected future profitability 
we consider our actual historical results over several years to have stronger weight than other more subjective indicators  including forecasts  when considering whether to establish or reduce a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
estimated interest and penalties are recorded as a component of interest expense and other expense  respectively 
as of december   we had approximately million of net deferred tax assets  against which we provided a million valuation allowance  resulting in a net deferred tax asset of million 
our net deferred tax assets relate primarily to certain foreign jurisdictions where we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
we continue to provide a full valuation allowance against net operating losses and other net deferred tax assets arising in certain jurisdictions  primarily in the united states and canada  as the 
table of contents realization of such assets is not considered to be more likely than not at this time 
we have reported income before income taxes for the year ended december  if we continue to generate income before income taxes in future periods  our conclusion about the realizability of our deferred tax assets and therefore the appropriateness of the valuation allowance could change in a future period and we could record a substantial gain in our consolidated statement of operations when that occurs 
research and development research and development expenses include costs incurred in the development and production of our hardware and software  costs incurred to enhance and support existing product features  costs incurred to support and improve our development processes  and costs related to future product development and costs to support and improve our development processes 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred  and may be offset by co funding from third parties 
we may also enter into arrangements whereby we make advance  non refundable payments to a vendor to perform certain research and development services 
these payments are deferred and recognized over the vendor s estimated performance period 
during the third quarter of  we amended a vendor agreement to settle outstanding performance issues 
we had made advance payments of million to the vendor 
the amendment called for us to receive a refund of million of amounts previously paid to the vendor and the right to receive rebates on future purchases 
as of december   the full balance of the refund had been received 
the rebate right of million is classified in other non current assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
no gain or loss was recorded as a result of this amendment 
amounts to be received under co funding arrangements with the us government are based on either contractual milestones or costs incurred 
these co funding milestone payments are recognized in operations as performance is estimated to be completed and are measured as milestone achievements occur or as costs are incurred 
these estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis and are subject to change  including in the near term 
if an estimate is changed  net research and development expense could be impacted significantly 
we do not record a receivable from the us government prior to completing the requirements necessary to bill for a milestone or cost reimbursement 
funding from the us government is subject to certain budget restrictions and milestones may be subject to completion risk  and as such  there may be periods in which research and development costs are expensed as incurred for which no reimbursement is recorded  as milestones have not been completed or the us government has not funded an agreement 
we classify amounts to be received from funded research and development projects as either revenue or a reduction to research and development expense  based on the specific facts and circumstances of the contractual arrangement  considering total costs expected to be incurred compared to total expected funding and the nature of the research and development contractual arrangement 
in the event that a particular arrangement is determined to represent revenue  the corresponding research and development costs are classified as cost of revenue 
share based compensation we measure compensation cost for share based payment awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest 
we recognize share based compensation expense for all share based payment awards  net of an estimated forfeiture rate 
we recognize compensation cost for only those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
we utilize the black scholes options pricing model to value the stock options granted under our options plans 
in this model  we utilize assumptions related to stock price volatility  stock option term and forfeiture rates that are based upon both historical factors as well as management s judgment 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock at the date of grant 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu the guidance in asu provides amendments to the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
the amendments establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which replaces fair value in the revenue allocation guidance  as the allocation of revenue can now be based on entity specific assumptions in addition to assumptions derived as a marketplace participant 
the amendments in asu are effective for revenue transactions entered into during fiscal years beginning on or after june  the company adopted this guidance effective january  and has elected to apply it retrospectively 
the adoption of this guidance and its retrospective application did not have a material impact on the company s financial results 
no changes to previously reported amounts in the historical financial statements were required as a result of retrospective application 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  or asu the guidance in asu changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 
tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality are excluded from the guidance applicable to software revenue recognition 
the amendments in asu are effective for revenue transactions entered into during fiscal years beginning on or after june  the company adopted this guidance effective january  and has elected to apply it retrospectively 
the adoption of this guidance and its retrospective application did not have a material impact on the company s financial results 
no changes to previously reported amounts in the historical financial statements were required as a result of retrospective application 
in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method topic milestone method of revenue recognition  or asu asu provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
consideration that is contingent on achievement of a milestone in its entirety may be recognized as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is judged to be substantive by meeting specific criteria 
the amendments in asu are effective for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  in accordance with the guidance  the company elected to early adopt its provisions as of january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s financial results nor would it have had a material impact had the guidance been adopted on january

in  current us federal income alternative minimum tax was partially offset by amounts receivable as a result of tax legislation that enables a corporation to recover certain previously generated us income tax credits 
we have reported income before income taxes for the year ended december  if we continue to generate income before income taxes in future periods  our conclusion about the realizability of our deferred tax assets and therefore the appropriateness of the valuation allowance could change in a future period and we could record a substantial gain in our consolidated statement of operations when that occurs 
as of december   we had federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that will expire between through  if not utilized 
liquidity and capital resources the company generates cash from operations predominantly from the sale of high performance computer systems and related services 
the company typically has a small number of significant contracts that make up the majority of total revenue 
the material changes in certain of the company s balance sheet accounts are due to the timing of product deliveries  customer acceptances  contractually determined billings and cash collections 
working capital requirements  including inventory purchases and normal capital expenditures  are generally funded with cash from operations 
the company received acceptances on a large number of systems in the fourth quarter of the final payments for these systems are not due until  which resulted in a high accounts receivable balance at year end 
accounts and other receivables increased from million at december  to million at december  inventory increased from million at december  to million at december  as certain systems and system upgrades had been delivered to customer sites but had not completed the acceptance process as of december  partially offsetting these impacts on our liquidity position has been an increase in the current portion of deferred revenues to million as of december  from million at december  resulting principally from contractual rights to bill certain of these customers for part of the contract before full customer acceptance and related revenue recognition

for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities related to proceeds from stock option exercises and stock purchases from our employee stock purchase plan

as of december   there was no outstanding balance on our notes 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was due primarily to million of cash paid to repurchase certain of our notes 
over the next twelve months  we expect our significant cash requirements will relate to operational expenses  consisting primarily of personnel costs  costs of inventory associated with certain large scale product deliveries  spare parts  outside engineering expenses  and the acquisition of property and equipment 
in addition  we lease certain equipment and facilities used in our operations under operating leases in the normal course of business 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands amounts committed by year contractual obligations total year years years thereafter development agreements operating leases unrecognized income tax benefits total contractual cash obligations in july  we amended our line of credit agreement with wells fargo to increase the maximum line of credit to million 
our line of credit with wells fargo has a maturity date of june  in september 
table of contents  we entered into a secured line of credit with silicon valley bank in the amount of million 
the first million is available at any time and the additional million is available if certain minimum financial ratios are exceeded 
our line of credit with silicon valley bank has a maturity date of september  we made no draws in and had no outstanding borrowings on these lines of credit as of december  in our normal course of operations  we have development arrangements under which we engage outside engineering resources to work on our research and development projects 
for the twelve months ended december   we incurred million for such arrangements 
at any particular time  our cash position is affected by the timing of cash receipts for product sales  maintenance contracts  government co funding for research and development activities and our payments for inventory  resulting in significant fluctuations in our cash balance from quarter to quarter and within a quarter 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash from operations 
we expect our cash resources to be adequate for at least the next twelve months 
the adequacy of our cash resources is dependent on the amount and timing of government funding as well as our ability to sell our products and to engage in custom engineering projects  with adequate gross profit 
beyond the next twelve months  the adequacy of our cash resources will largely depend on our success in achieving profitable operations and positive operating cash flows on a sustained basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and equity price fluctuations 
interest rate risk we invest our available cash in money market mutual funds whose underlying investments include investment grade debt instruments of corporate issuers and in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies 
we do not have any derivative instruments or auction rate securities in our investment portfolio 
we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
although we have the above noted risks  a change in interest rates would not be significant 
foreign currency risk we sell our products primarily in north america  asia and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our products are generally priced based on us dollars  and a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
while we often sell products with payments in us dollars  our product sales contracts may call for payment in foreign currencies and to the extent we do so  or engage with our foreign subsidiaries in transactions deemed to be short term in nature  we are subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
as of december   we had entered into forward exchange contracts that hedge approximately million of anticipated cash receipts on specific foreign currency denominated sales contracts 
these forward contracts hedge the risk of foreign exchange rate changes between the time that the related contracts were signed and when the cash receipts are expected to be received 
our foreign maintenance contracts are typically paid in local currencies and provide a partial natural hedge against foreign exchange exposure 
to the extent that we wish to repatriate any of these funds to the united states  however  we are subject to foreign exchange risks 
as of december   a change in foreign exchange rates could impact our annual earnings and cash flows by approximately million
