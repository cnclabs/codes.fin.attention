item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data in item and the financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview and outlook we are a crude oil and natural gas exploration and production company 
our properties are located in montana  north dakota and new york 
our corporate strategy is to build shareholder value through the development and acquisition of crude oil and natural gas assets that exhibit economically producible hydrocarbons 
as of march   we controlled the rights to mineral leases covering approximately  net acres prospective for the bakken and three forks and  we acquired  net acres at an average price of  per acre  of which or  net acres were permitted as of march  our goal is to continue to explore for and develop hydrocarbons within the mineral leases we control as well as continue to expand our acreage position should opportunities present themselves 
to accomplish our objectives we must achieve the following  continue to develop our substantial inventory of high quality core bakken acreage with results consistent with those to date  retain and attract talented personnel  continue to be a low cost producer of hydrocarbons  actively manage our cost structure and focus on accretive acquisitions  and continue to manage our financial obligations to access the appropriate capital needed to develop our position of primarily undrilled acreage

results of operations for the periods ended december  and december  during and we significantly increased our drilling activities  generated income and achieved net earnings for both the and fiscal years 
as of december   we have developed approximately of our total bakken and three forks prospective drillable acreage inventory assuming one well per acre spacing unit and we expect to continue to add substantial volumes of production on a quarter over quarter basis going forward into the foreseeable future 
we are predominately weighted to spacing units compared to  spacing units  however we believe we will eventually grow into an average spacing unit size of net acres per spacing unit over time as our acreage continues to be developed 
as of december   we had established production from gross net wells in which we hold working interests  versus gross net wells which had established production as of december  our production at december  approximated  barrels of crude oil per day  compared to approximately  barrels of crude oil per day as of december  we drilled with a success rate in and with gross and net bakken or three forks wells drilling  awaiting completion or completing as of december  as of march   we had gross and net bakken or three forks wells drilling  awaiting completion  or completing 
we have spud approximately net bakken or three forks wells and expect to spud an additional net wells in the first quarter of our revenues  costs and net income increased in compared to as we continued our development plans and significantly increased our production 
revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is primarily due to our continued addition of wells and an increase in our average realized crude oil prices period over period 
we have added wells each quarter since the first quarter of and  in particular  added production from additional net wells during during  we realized a average price per barrel of crude oil after the effect of settled hedges  compared to a average price per barrel of crude oil after the effect of settled hedges during we realized net income of  representing approximately per diluted share for the year ended december   and net income of  representing approximately per diluted share for the year ended december  the increase in net income is primarily due to our continued addition of crude oil and natural gas production from new wells and higher realized commodity prices in compared to  partially offset by an increase in unrealized mark to market hedging losses 
total operating expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to total operating expenses of  for the year ended december  the increase in operating expenses is due primarily to increased production expenses  production taxes  depletion and general and administrative expenses associated with our continued addition of crude oil and natural gas production from new wells 

table of contents during the year ended december   we had production expenses of  compared to production expenses of  during the year ended december  the increase in production expense is primarily a result of more mature wells utilizing artificial lift and the general aging of our production 
during the year ended december   we incurred production taxes of  compared to production taxes of  during the year ended december  the increase in production taxes is primarily due to the continued addition of producing oil and gas properties and related sales 
we recorded depletion of  during the year ended december   compared to depletion of  during the year ended december  the increase in depletion is primarily due to the addition of proven properties subject to the depletion calculation 
depletion expense for fiscal year was per boe  compared to per boe  for fiscal year we expect depletion per boe to remain consistent in compared to we had general and administrative expenses of  and  during the years ended december  and  which included  and  net of share based compensation expense  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expense is primarily due to the increase in share based compensation  personnel  and travel expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to remain consistent in compared to non gaap net income for the year ended december   excluding unrealized mark to market hedging losses  was  representing approximately per diluted share as compared to non gaap net income of  representing approximately per diluted share for the year ended december   excluding unrealized mark to market hedging gains 
the increase in non gaap net income is primarily due to our continued addition of crude oil and natural gas production from new wells and higher realized commodity prices in compared to we define adjusted ebitda as net income before i interest expense  ii income taxes  iii depreciation  depletion and amortization  iv accretion of abandonment liability  v pre tax unrealized gain and losses on commodity risk and vii non cash expenses relating to share based payments recognized under asc topic adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  was  representing approximately per diluted share  compared to adjusted ebitda of  representing approximately per diluted share for the year ended december  the increase in adjusted ebitda is primarily due to our continued addition of crude oil and natural gas production from new wells and higher realized commodity prices i n compared to we believe the use of non gaap financial measures provides useful information to investors to gain an overall understanding of our current financial performance 
specifically  we believe the non gaap results included herein provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses and unrealized commodity gains and losses that our management believes are not indicative of our core operating results 
in addition  these non gaap financial measures are used by management for budgeting and forecasting as well as subsequently measuring our performance  and we believe that we are providing investors with financial measures that most closely align to our internal measurement processes 
we consider these non gaap measures to be useful in evaluating our core operating results as they more closely reflect our essential revenue generating activities and direct operating expenses resulting in cash expenditures needed to perform these revenue generating activities 
our management also believes  based on feedback provided by the investment community  that the non gaap financial measures are necessary to allow the investment community to construct its valuation models to better compare our results with our competitors and market sector 
the non gaap financial information is presented using consistent methodology from year to year 
these measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap 
in addition  these non gaap financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles 
we believe that non gaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap financial measures

results of operations for the periods ended december  and december  during and we significantly increased our drilling activities  generated income and achieved net earnings for both the and fiscal years 
to date  we have developed approximately seven percent of our total drillable acreage inventory assuming one well per acre spacing unit and we expect to continue to add substantial volumes of production on a quarter over quarter basis going forward into the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had established production from gross net wells in which we hold working interests  gross net wells of which had established production as of december  our production at december  approximated  barrels of crude oil per day  compared to approximately barrels of crude oil per day as of december  our production increased to  barrels of crude oil per day as of march  we drilled with a success rate in and with bakken or three forks wells completed or completing 
we also had three successful red river discoveries at december  our revenues  costs and net income increased in compared to as we continued our development plans and significantly increased our production 
revenues for the twelve month period ended december  were  compared to  for the twelve month period ended december  these increases in revenue are primarily due to our continued addition of wells  partially offset by lower sales prices 
we have added wells each quarter since the first quarter of and  in particular  added production from additional net wells during 
table of contents we realized net income of  representing approximately per diluted share for the year ended december  and net income of  representing approximately per diluted share for the year ended december  total operating expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to total operating expenses of  for the year ended december  these increases in expense are due primarily to increased production expenses  production taxes  depletion and general and administrative expenses associated with our continued addition of crude oil and natural gas production from new wells 
during the year ended december   we had production expenses of  compared to production expenses of  during the year ended december  the increase in production expense was primarily a result of more mature wells utilizing artificial lift and the general aging of our production 
during the year ended december   we incurred production taxes of  compared to production taxes of  during the year ended december  the increase in production taxes was primarily due to the continued addition of producing oil and gas properties and related sales 
we recorded depletion of  during the year ended december   compared to depletion of  during the year ended december  the increase in depletion was primarily due to the addition of proven properties subject to the depletion calculation 
we had general and administrative expenses of  and  during the year ended december  and  which included  and  net of share based compensation expense  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to the increase in share based compensation  professional service  personnel  and travel expenses 
non gaap net income for the year ended december   excluding unrealized mark to market hedging losses  was  representing approximately per diluted share as compared to net income of  representing approximately per diluted share for the year ended december   excluding unrealized mark to market hedging gains 
adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  was  representing approximately per diluted share  compared to adjusted ebitda of  representing approximately per diluted share for the year ended december  operation plan we expect to drill approximately net wells in with associated drilling capital expenditures approximating million 
the wells are expected to target both the bakken and three forks formations 
drilling capital expenditures are expected to increase in due to the continued success of longer laterals and additional fractional stimulation stages 
we currently expect to drill wells during at an average completed cost of million per well  which represents a to increase in drilling costs for compared to based on evolving conditions in the field  we expect to continue to evaluate further strategic acreage acquisitions during assuming we acquire to net acres each business day at an average cost of  per net acre  we expect to incur approximately million to million of acreage capital expenditures during we expect to fund all commitments using cash on hand  cash flow and our currently undrawn credit facility 
our future financial results will depend primarily on i the ability to continue to source and screen potential projects  ii the ability to discover commercial quantities of crude oil and natural gas  iii the market price for crude oil and natural gas  and iv the ability to fully implement our exploration and development program  which is dependent on the availability of capital resources 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any of these respects  that the prices of crude oil and natural gas prevailing at the time of production will be at a level allowing for profitable production  or that we will be able to obtain additional funding if necessary 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to meet potential cash requirements 
we have historically met our capital requirements through the issuance of common stock and by short term borrowings 
in the future  we anticipate we will be able to provide the necessary liquidity by the revenues generated from the sales of our crude oil and natural gas reserves in our existing properties  however  if we do not generate sufficient sales revenues we will continue to finance our operations through equity and or debt financings 
the following table summarizes total current assets  total current liabilities and working capital at december  current assets current liabilities working capital macquarie credit facility on may   we completed the assignment of our revolving credit facility to macquarie bank limited macquarie from cit capital usa inc in connection with the assignment  our company and macquarie entered into an amended and restated credit agreement governing the facility 
the facility provides up to a maximum of million in principal amount of borrowings to be used as working capital for exploration and production operations 
initially  million of financing was available under the facility 
as of december  and march   we had no borrowings under the facility 
the borrowing base of funds available to us is redetermined semi annually based upon the net present value  discounted at per annum  of the future net revenues expected to accrue from the its interests in proved reserves estimated to be produced from its crude oil and natural gas properties 
based on these borrowing base redeterminations  an additional million of financing could become available to our company 
the facility terminates on may  we have the option to designate the reference rate of interest for each specific borrowing under the facility as amounts are advanced 
borrowings based upon the london interbank offering rate libor will bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus a spread ranging from to  depending on the percentage of borrowing base that is currently advanced 
any borrowings not designated as being based upon libor will bear interest at a rate equal to the greater of a the current prime rate published by the wall street journal  or b the current one month libor rate plus  plus in either case a spread ranging from to  depending on the percentage of borrowing base that is currently advanced 
we have the option to designate either pricing mechanism 
interest paym ents are due under the facility in arrears  in the case of a loan based on libor on the last day of the specified interest period and in the case of all other loans on the last day of each march  june  september and december 
all outstanding principal is due and payable upon termination of the facility 
the applicable interest rate increases under the facility and the lenders may accelerate payments under the facility  or call all obligations due under certain circumstances  upon an event of default 
the facility references various events constituting a default  including  but not limited to  failure to pay interest on any loan under the facility  any material violation of any representation or warranty under the amended and restated credit agreement  failure to observe or perform certain covenants  conditions or agreements under the amended and restated credit agreement  a change in control of our company  default under any other material indebtedness of our company  bankruptcy and similar proceedings and failure to pay disbursements from lines of credit issued under the facility 

table of contents the facility requires that our company enter into swap agreements with macquarie for each month of the month period following the date on which each such swap agreement is executed  the notional volumes for which when aggregated with other commodity swap agreements and additional fixed price physical off take contracts then in effect  as of the date such swap agreement is executed  is not less than  nor greater than  of the reasonably anticipated projected production from our proved developed producing reserves 
all of our obligations under the facility and the swap agreements with macquarie are secured by a first priority security interest in any and all of our assets 
follow on equity offerings on april   we sold and issued a total of  shares of common stock to various institutional investors for per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriters discounts 
the proceeds were used to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities  to fund our accelerated drilling program  to repay short term borrowings  and for other working capital purposes 
canaccord adams inc acted as sole book running manager and c 
k 
cooper company  inc acted as a co managing underwriter for the offering 
on november   we sold and issued a total of  shares of common stock to various institutional investors for per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriters discounts 
the proceeds were used to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities  to fund our accelerated drilling program and for other working capital purposes 
canaccord genuity acted as sole book running manager and howard weil incorporated acted as co lead manager 
capital one southcoast  suntrust robinson humphrey  ck cooper company  dougherty company and northland capital markets acted as co managers for the offering 
satisfaction of our cash obligations for the next months with the further addition of equity capital during and our credit facility  we believe we have sufficient capital to meet our drilling commitments and expected general and administrative expenses for the next twelve months at a minimum 
nonetheless  any strategic acquisition of assets may require us to access the capital markets at some point in we may also choose to access the equity capital markets rather than our credit facility or other debt instruments to fund accelerated or continued drilling at the discretion of management and depending on prevailing market conditions 
we will evaluate any potential opportunities for acquisitions as they arise 
given our non leveraged asset base and anticipated growing cash flows  we believe we are in a position to take advantage of any appropriately priced sales that may occur 
however  there can be no assurance that any additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
over the next months it is possible that our existing capital  the credit facility and anticipated funds from operations may not be sufficient to sustain continued acreage acquisition 
consequently  we may seek additional capital in the future to fund growth and expansion through additional equity or debt financing or credit facilities 
no assurance can be made that such financing would be available  and if available it may take either the form of debt or equity 
in either case  the financing could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our shareholders 
though we achieved profitability in and remained profitable throughout and  our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of operations  particularly companies in the crude oil and natural gas exploration industry 
such risks include  but are not limited to  an evolving and unpredictable business model and the management of growth 
to address these risks we must  among other things  implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy  continue to develop and upgrade technology and products  respond to competitive developments  and attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks  and the failure to do so can have a material adverse effect on our business prospects  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents effects of inflation and pricing the crude oil and natural gas industry is very cyclical and the demand for goods and services of crude oil field companies  suppliers and others associated with the industry put extreme pressure on the economic stability and pricing structure within the industry 
typically  as prices for crude oil and natural gas increase  so do all associated costs 
conversely  in a period of declining prices  associated cost declines are likely to lag and may not adjust downward in proportion 
material changes in prices also impact our current revenue stream  estimates of future reserves  borrowing base calculations of bank loans  impairment assessments of crude oil and natural gas properties  and values of properties in purchase and sale transactions 
material changes in prices can impact the value of crude oil and natural gas companies and their a bility to raise capital  borrow money and retain personnel 
while we do not currently expect business costs to materially increase  higher prices for crude oil and natural gas could result in increases in the costs of materials  services and personnel 
contractual obligations and commitments as of december   we did not have any material long term debt obligations  capital lease obligations  operating lease obligations or purchase obligations requiring future payments other than our office lease that expires on january  the following table illustrates our contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period contractual obligations less than year years years more than years total office lease automobile leases total our office lease commenced on february  and continues for a period of five years 
in september  we entered into an automobile lease for a vehicle utilized by one employee  which will expire in september 
in july  we entered into automobile leases for vehicles utilized by two additional employees  which will expire in july in september  we entered into an automobile lease for a vehicle utilized by one employee  which will expire in september product research and development we do not anticipate performing any significant product research and development given our current plan of operation 
expected purchase or sale of any significant equipment we do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any plant or significant equipment as such items are not required by us at this time or anticipated to be needed in the next twelve months 

table of contents critical accounting policies the establishment and consistent application of accounting policies is a vital component of accurately and fairly presenting our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  as well as ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing financial reporting 
while there are rarely alternative methods or rules from which to select in establishing accounting and financial reporting policies  proper application often involves significant judgment regarding a given set of facts and circumstances and a complex series of decisions 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements under us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates of our proved crude oil and natural gas reserves  future development costs  estimates relating to certain crude oil and natural gas revenues and expenses  fair value of derivative instruments  fair value of certain investments  and deferred income taxes are the most critical to our financial statements 
crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of depreciation  depletion and amortization expense as well as impairments that are recognized on our crude oil and natural gas properties are highly dependent on the estimates of the proved crude oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in the future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  production taxes and development costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as the prices of crude oil and na tural gas and cost levels change from year to year  the economics of producing our reserves may change and therefore the estimate of proved reserves may also change 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
the information regarding present value of the future net cash flows attributable to our proved crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates only and should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
thus  such information includes revisions of certain reserve estimates attributable to our properties included in the prior year s estimates 
these revisions reflect additional information from subsequent activities  production history of the properties involved and any adjustments in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in crude oil and natural gas prices 
any future downward revisions could adversely affect our financial condition  our borrowing ability  our future prospects and the value of our common stock 
the estimates of our proved crude oil and natural gas reserves used in the preparation of our financial statements were prepared by ryder scott company  our registered independent petroleum consultants  and were prepared in accordance with the rules promulgated by the sec 
crude oil and natural gas properties the method of accounting we use to account for our crude oil and natural gas investments determines what costs are capitalized and how these costs are ultimately matched with revenues and expensed 
we utilize the full cost method of accounting to account for our crude oil and natural gas investments instead of the successful efforts method because we believe it more accurately reflects the underlying economics of our programs to explore and develop crude oil and natural gas reserves 
the full cost method embraces the concept that dry holes and other expenditures that fail to add reserves are intrinsic to the crude oil and natural gas exploration business 
thus  under the full cost method  all costs incurred in connection with the acquisition  development and exploration of crude oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized 
these capitalized amounts include the costs of unproved properties  internal costs directly related to acquisitions  development and exploration activities  asset retirement costs  geological and geophysical costs and capitalized interest 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  they are part of a program from which we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
the full cost method differs from the successful efforts method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas investments 
the primary difference between these two methods is the treatment of exploratory dry hole costs 
these costs are generally expensed under the successful efforts method when it is determined that measurable reserves do not exist 
geological and geophysical costs are also expensed under the successful efforts method 
under the full cost method  both dry hole costs and geological and geophysical costs are initially capitalized and classified as unproved properties pending determination of proved reserves 
if no proved reserves are discovered  these costs are then amortized with all the costs in the full cost pool 

table of contents capitalized amounts except unproved costs are depleted using the units of production method 
the depletion expense per unit of production is the ratio of the sum of our unamortized historical costs and estimated future development costs to our proved reserve volumes 
estimation of hydrocarbon reserves relies on professional judgment and use of factors that cannot be precisely determined 
subsequent reserve estimates materially different from those reported would change the depletion expense recognized during the future reporting periods 
for the year ended december   our average depletion expense per unit of production was per boe 
a decrease in our estimated net proved reserves at december  would result in a per boe increase in our per unit depletion expense and a  decrease in our pre tax net income 
to the extent the capitalized costs in our full cost pool net of depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred taxes exceed the sum of the present value using a discount rate and based on period end crude oil and natural gas prices of the estimated future net cash flows from our proved crude oil and natural gas reserves and the capitalized cost associated with our unproved properties  we would have a capitalized ceiling impairment 
such costs would be charged to operations as a reduction of the carrying value of crude oil and natural gas properties 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties increases when crude oil and natural gas prices are depressed  even if the low prices are temporary 
in addition  capitalized ceiling impairment charges may occur if we experience poor drilling results or estimations of our proved reserves are substantially reduced 
a capitalized ceil ing impairment is a reduction in earnings that does not impact cash flows  but does impact operating income and shareholders equity 
once recognized  a capitalized ceiling impairment charge to crude oil and natural gas properties cannot be reversed at a later date 
the risk that we will experience a ceiling test writedown increases when crude oil and natural gas prices are depressed or if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves 
as of december  we have not incurred a capitalized ceiling impairment charge 
however  no assurance can be given that we will not experience a capitalized ceiling impairment charge in future periods 
in addition  capitalized ceiling impairment charges may occur if estimates of proved hydrocarbon reserves are substantially reduced or estimates of future development costs increase significantly 
asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations to plug and abandon our crude oil and natural gas wells and related equipment 
liabilities for asset retirement obligations are recorded at fair value in the period incurred 
the related asset value is increased by the same amount 
asset retirement costs included in the carrying amount of the related asset are subsequently allocated to expense as part of our depletion calculation 
additionally  increases in the discounted asset retirement liability resulting from the passage of time are reported as accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations expense on our statement of operations 
estimating future asset retirement obligations requires us to make estimates and judgments regarding timing  existence of a liability  as well as what constitutes adequate restoration 
we use the present value of estimated cash flows related to our asset retirement obligations to determine the fair value 
present value calculations inherently incorporate numerous assumptions and judgments  which include the ultimate retirement and restoration costs  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of our existing asset retirement obligation liability  a corresponding adjustment will be made to the carrying cost of the related asset 
income taxes deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences in financial statement and tax basis amounts that will result in deductible amounts and carry forwards in future years 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will result in taxable amounts in future years 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax law and tax rate s for the year in which we expect the temporary differences to be deducted or settled 
the effect of a change in tax law or rates on the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of enactment 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
significant future taxable income would be required to realize this net tax asset 
estimating the amount of the valuation allowance is dependent on estimates of future taxable income  alternative minimum tax income  and changes in shareholder ownership that would trigger limits on use of net operating losses under internal revenue code section 
table of contents revenue recognition we derive revenue primarily from the sale of the crude oil and natural gas from our interests in producing wells  hence our revenue recognition policy for these sales is significant 
we recognize revenue from the sale of crude oil and natural gas when production is delivered to  and title has transferred to  the purchaser and to the extent the selling price is reasonable determinable 
we use the sales method of accounting for natural gas balancing of natural gas production and would recognize a liability if the existing proven reserves were not adequate to cover the current imbalance situation 
as of december    and  our natural gas production was in balance  meaning its cumulative portion of natural gas production taken and sold from wells in which it has an interest equaled its entitled interest in natural gas production from those wells 
settlements for hydrocarbon sales can occur up to two months after the end of the month in which the crude oil  natural gas or other hydrocarbon products were produced 
we estimate and accrue for the value of these sales using information available to us at the time our financial statements are generated 
differences are reflected in the accounting period that payments are received from the operator 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we use derivative instruments from time to time to manage market risks resulting from fluctuations in prices of crude oil and natural gas 
we periodically enter into derivative contracts  including price swaps  caps and floors  which require payments to or receipts from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed price and a variable price for a fixed quantity of crude oil and natural gas without the exchange of underlying volumes 
the notional amounts of these financial instruments are based on expected production from existing wells 
derivatives  historically  were recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of derivatives were recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative was designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it was  depending on the type of hedge transaction 
our derivatives historically consisted primarily of cash flow hedge transactions in which we were hedging the variability of cash flows related to a forecasted transaction 
period to period changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the periods in which the contracts were settled 
 the ineffective portion of the cash flow hedges were reflected in current period earnings as gain or loss from derivative 
gains and losses on derivative instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting were included in income or loss from derivatives in the period in which they occur 
the resulting cash flows from derivatives were reported as cash flows from operating activities 
on november   due to the volatility of price differentials in the williston basin  we de designated all derivatives that were previously classified as cash flow hedges and in addition  we have elected not to designate any subsequent derivative contracts as accounting hedges under fasb asc as such  all derivative positions are carried at their fair value on the balance sheet and are marked to market at the end of each period 
any realized and unrealized gains or losses are recorded on the statement of operations 
we elected to include all derivative settlements and unrealized gains losses within revenues 
new accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued fasb asc prior authoritative literature  fasb statement  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities

table of contents in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
asu updated the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance currently included in fasb asc the revised guidance provided for two significant changes to the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance 
the first change related to the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
this change resulted in the requirement to separate more deliverables within an arrangement  ultimately leading to less revenue deferral 
the second change modified the manner in which the transaction consideration was allocated across the separately identified deliverables 
together  these changes resulted in earlier recognition of revenue and related costs for multiple element arrangements than under previous guidance 
this guidance expanded the disclosures required for multiple element revenue arrangements effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted for a description of the accounting standards that we adopted in  see notes to financial statements note significant accounting policies 
various accounting standards and interpretations were issued in with effective dates subsequent to december  we have evaluated the recently issued accounting pronouncements that are effective in and believe that none of them will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows when adopted 
further  we are monitoring the joint standard setting efforts of the financial accounting standards board and the international accounting standards board 
there are a large number of pending accounting standards that are being targeted for completion in and beyond  including  but not limited to  standards relating to revenue recognition  accounting for leases  fair value measurements  accounting for financial instruments  disclosure of loss contingencies and financial statement presentation 
because these pending standards have not yet been finalized  at this time we are not able to determine the potential future impact that these standards will have  if any  on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the price we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production heavily influences our revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
crude oil and natural gas are commodities and  therefore  their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand 
historically  the markets for crude oil and natural gas have been volatile  and these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control 
our revenue during generally would have increased or decreased along with any increases or decreases in crude oil or natural gas prices  but the exact impact on our income is indeterminable given the variety of expenses associated with producing and selling crude oil that also increa se and decrease along with crude oil prices 
we have previously entered into derivative contracts to achieve a more predictable cash flow by reducing our exposure to crude oil and natural gas price volatility 
on november   due to the volatility of price differentials in the williston basin  we de designated all derivatives that were previously classified as cash flow hedges and in addition  we have elected not to designate any subsequent derivative contracts as accounting hedges 
as such  all derivative positions are carried at their fair value on the balance sheet and are marked to market at the end of each period 
any realized gains and losses are recorded to gain loss on settled derivatives and unrealized gains or losses are recorded to mark to market of derivative instruments on the statement of operations rather than as a component of other comprehensive income loss or other income expense

the crude oil swap contract is for  barrels of crude oil with settlement periods between january and december the price on the contract is fixed at per barrel 
in january  we entered into a costless collar purchased put options and written call options 
the costless collars are used to establish floor and ceiling prices on anticipated crude oil and natural gas production 
there were no net premiums paid or received by us related to the costless collar agreement 
we purchased put options at per barrel and call options at per barrel on  barrels of crude oil 
the costless collar amounts settle between february and december in february  we entered into a commodity swap contract

interest rate risk we did not have outstanding any borrowings under our credit facilities or other obligations that would subject us to significant interest rate risk at december  our credit facility with macquarie will  however  subject us to interest rate risk on borrowings under that facility 
the credit facility allows us to fix the interest rate of borrowings under it for all or a portion of the principal balance for a period up to six months 
to the extent the interest rate is fixed  interest rate changes affect the instrument s fair market value but do not impact results of operations or cash flows 
conversely  for the portion of our borrowings that has a floating interest rate  interest rate changes will not affect the fair market value but will impact future results of operations and cash flows
