item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we design  develop  manufacture and sell advanced  rechargeable lithium ion batteries and battery systems 
our target markets are the transportation  electric grid services and commercial markets 
we market and sell our products primarily through a direct sales force 
in the transportation market  we are focusing sales of our batteries and battery systems to automotive and heavy duty vehicle manufacturers either directly or through tier suppliers 
we work with automotive and heavy duty vehicle manufacturers directly to educate and inform them about the benefits of our technology for use in hybrid electric vehicles  or hevs  plug in hybrid electric vehicles  or phevs and electric vehicles  or evs  and are engaged in design and development efforts with several automotive and heavy duty vehicle manufacturers and tier suppliers 
at the same time  we work with tier suppliers who are developing integrated solutions using our batteries 
in the electric grid services market  our sales have been initiated directly by our sales force 
in the commercial market  our sales are made both directly and indirectly through distributors with key accounts managed by our sales personnel 
we have entered into an exclusive agreement to license certain of our technology in the field of commercial electronic devices excluding power tools and certain other consumer products and expect to receive royalty fees on net sales of licensed products that include our technology 
we expect to continue to expand our sales presence in europe and asia as our business in those regions continues to grow 
we expect international markets to provide increased opportunities for our products 
our sales cycles vary by product and market segment 
most of our batteries and battery systems typically undergo a lengthy development and qualification period prior to commercial production 
we expect that the total time from customer introduction to commercial production will range up to five years depending on the specific product and market served 
our long and unpredictable sales cycles and the potential large size of battery supply and development contracts cause our period to period financial results to be susceptible to significant variability 
since most of our operating and capital expenses are incurred up front based on the anticipated timing of estimated design wins and customer orders  the loss or delay of any such orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for any particular period 
the variability in our period to period results will also be driven by likely period to period variations in product mix and by the seasonality experienced by some of the end markets into which we sell our products 
in the electric grid market  revenue recognition will be volatile due to the timing of deployment  delivery  and commissioning 
as such  the timing of these events will significantly affect the comparison of period to period revenues 
we have been expanding our manufacturing capacity since inception  including the current expansion of our livonia and romulus  michigan facilities  and we intend to further expand our manufacturing capacity by constructing more manufacturing lines  primarily in michigan 
we are currently in transition as we are expanding capacity in anticipation of increased demand for our prismatic cells as we expect transportation product revenues to increase in future periods 
we intend to further accelerate the expansion of our manufacturing capacity subject to actual and anticipated future demand for our products and the receipt of additional stimulus funds from the us and state governments 
in the first quarter of  we began making investments against plans to further expand the final assembly capacity of our michigan facilities 
based on new design wins and our demand estimates  we have approved plans to increase our capacity in michigan  resulting in a worldwide capacity of over mwh 
we believe that increases in production capacity have had  and will continue to have  a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have made and 
table of contents continue to make significant up front investments in our manufacturing capacity  which negatively impact earnings and cash balances  but we expect these investments will increase our revenue in the long term 
our research and development efforts are focused on developing new products and improving the performance of existing products 
we fund our research and development initiatives both from internal and external sources 
as part of our development strategy  certain customers fund or partially fund research and development efforts to design and customize batteries and battery systems for their specific application 
we have continued to experience significant losses since inception  as we have continued to invest significantly to support the anticipated growth in our business 
in particular  we have invested in product development and sales and marketing in order to meet product requirements of our target markets and to secure design wins that may lead to strong revenue growth and general and administrative overhead to develop the infrastructure to support the business 
we have also invested in the expansion of our manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated demand and our battery systems capabilities to provide battery systems solutions to our customers 
as our business grows  the key factors to improving our financial performance will be revenue growth and revenue diversification into the transportation and electric grid services markets 
our revenue growth and revenue diversification will depend on our ability to secure design wins in the transportation and electric grid services markets 
higher revenue will also increase gross margin  as higher production volumes will provide for increased absorption of manufacturing overhead and will reduce  on a percentage basis  the costs associated with our production capacity 
in december  we executed an agreement with the doe regarding the terms and conditions of the million grant awarded under the doe battery initiative to fund the construction of new lithium ion battery manufacturing facilities in michigan 
under the doe battery initiative  we are required to spend up to one dollar of our funds for every incentive dollar received 
through december   we have received million in reimbursement for costs incurred 
as of december   we have incurred additional allowable costs entitling us to receive million in reimbursements  which has been recorded as a receivable we are also negotiating a loan under the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing loan program  or the atvm program  to support this manufacturing expansion 
based on the amount of our grant award under the doe battery initiative and the guidelines associated with the atvm program  we believe we will be permitted to borrow up to million under the atvm program 
we expect we will be required to spend one dollar of our own funds for every four dollars we borrow under the atvm program 
the timing and the amount of any loan we may receive under the atvm program  as well as the specific terms and conditions applicable to any loan we may receive are currently not known by us  and  once disclosed to us  are subject to change and negotiation with the federal government 
in october  we entered into a high tech credit agreement with the michigan economic growth authority  or mega  pursuant to which we are eligible for a year tax credit  beginning with payments made for the fiscal year 
this credit has an estimated value of up to million  depending on the number of jobs we create in michigan 
in november  we entered into a cell manufacturing credit agreement with mega pursuant to which we are eligible for a credit equal to of our capital investment expenses commencing january  up to a maximum of million over a four year period related to the construction of our integrated battery cell manufacturing plant 
the tax credit proceeds shall not exceed million per year beginning with the tax year of we are required to create jobs no later than december  in order for the tax credit proceeds to be non refundable 
the tax credit is subject to a repayment provision in the event we relocate or more of the jobs outside of the state of michigan within three years after the last year we received 
table of contents the tax credit 
through december  we have incurred expenses of million in qualified expenses related to the construction of the livonia and romulus facilities 
when we have met the filing requirements for the tax year ending december   we expect to begin receiving million in proceeds related to these expenses limited to million per year over a four year period 
we have recorded a receivable of million  as it is reasonably assured that we will comply with the conditions of the tax credit and will receive proceeds 
upon recording the receivable in the fourth quarter of  we reduced the basis in the fixed assets acquired in accordance with the tax credit and this will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations over their estimated useful lives of the depreciable asset as reduced depreciation expense 
financial operations overview revenue we derive revenue from product sales and providing services 
product revenue 
product revenue is derived from the sale of our batteries and battery systems 
for the years ended december  and  product revenue represented and of our total revenue  respectively 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of customers 
our two largest customers bae systems  or bae  and aes energy storage  llc  or aes accounted for approximately and of our total revenue during the year ended december   respectively  and we expect that most of our revenue will continue to come from a relatively small number of customers for the foreseeable future 
as we increase our focus on the transportation and electric grid markets  bae and aes will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue in the near term  and the loss of bae or aes as a customer could have a material adverse effect on our short term revenue 
we expect the transportation market and the electric grid market to represent the largest portion of our revenue in the near and long term 
services revenue 
services revenue is primarily derived from contracts awarded by the us federal government  other government agencies and commercial customers 
these activities range from pure research  in which we investigate design techniques on new battery technologies at the request of a government agency or commercial customer  to custom development projects in which we are paid to enhance or modify an existing product or develop a new product to meet a customer specifications 
we expect to continue to perform funded research and development work and to use the technology developed to advance our new product development efforts 
we expect that revenue from services will vary period to period depending on the timing of cash payments received and  if applicable  the achievement of milestones 
we expect that services revenue will decrease as a percentage of our total revenue due to the expected increase in product revenue over the long term 
deferred revenue 
we record deferred revenue for product sales and services in several different circumstances 
these circumstances include i the products have been delivered or services have been performed but other revenue recognition criteria have not been satisfied ii payments have been received in advance of products being delivered or services being performed and iii when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  but we are not able to reasonably estimate the warranty expense 
deferred revenue includes customer deposits and up front fees associated with service arrangements 
deferred revenue expected to be recognized as revenue more than one year subsequent to the balance sheet date is classified as long term deferred revenue 
deferred revenue will vary depending on the timing and amount of cash receipts from customers and can vary significantly depending on specific contractual terms 
as a result  deferred revenue is likely to fluctuate from period to period 
we have received and recorded as deferred revenue a total of million in up front  support and additional payments in connection with our license agreement with gillette 
in 
table of contents addition  the agreement requires gillette to pay us royalty fees on net sales of products that include our technology 
we have agreed with gillette that if  during a certain period following execution of the license agreement  we enter into an agreement with a third party that materially restricts gillette license rights under the license agreement  then we may be required to refund to gillette all license and support fees paid to us by gillette under the license agreement  plus  in certain cases  an additional amount to cover gillette capital and other expenses paid and or committed by gillette in reliance upon its rights under the license agreement 
revenue recognition is expected to commence upon successful transfer of technology know how to gillette 
the license and support fee will be recognized on a straight line basis over the longer of the patent term or the expected customer relationship 
factors that may affect comparability public company expenses 
in september  we completed an initial public offering of shares of our common stock 
as a result  we are subject to laws  regulations  and requirements that we were not required to comply with as a private company  including the sarbanes oxley act of  other sec regulations and the requirements of the nasdaq global select market 
compliance with these requirements required us to increase our general and administrative expenses in order to pay consultants  legal counsel and independent registered public accountants to assist us in  among other things  instituting and monitoring a more comprehensive compliance and board governance function  establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and preparing and distributing periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws 
in addition  as a public company  it is more expensive for us to obtain and maintain directors and officers liability insurance 
cost of revenue and gross profit cost of product revenue includes the cost of raw materials  labor and components that are required for the production of our products  as well as manufacturing overhead costs including depreciation  inventory obsolescence charges  and warranty costs 
raw material costs  which are our most significant cost item over the past two years  have historically been stable  but increasing energy costs for some of our materials are expected to increase this cost 
this increase may be partially offset by process innovation  dual sourcing of materials and increased volume if we achieve better economies of scale 
we incur costs associated with unabsorbed manufacturing expenses prior to a factory operating at normal operating capacity 
we expect these unabsorbed manufacturing costs  which include certain personnel  rent  utilities  materials  testing and depreciation costs  to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the near term 
cost of services revenue includes the direct labor costs of engineering resources committed to funded service contracts  as well as third party consulting  and associated direct material and equipment costs 
additionally  we include overhead expenses such as occupancy costs associated with the project resources  engineering tools and supplies and program management expense 
our gross profit loss is affected by a number of factors  including the mix of products sold  customer diversification  the mix between product revenue and services revenue  average selling prices  foreign exchange rates  our actual manufacturing costs and costs associated with increasing production capacity until full production is achieved 
as we continue to grow and build out our manufacturing capacity  and as new product designs come into production  our gross profit will continue to fluctuate from period to period 
we are rapidly expanding our capacity to meet anticipated customer demand  including building out additional manufacturing capacity at our livonia and romulus  michigan facilities 
during  we more than doubled our worldwide manufacturing capacity from mwh to approximately mwh 
this expansion is part of our plan to support annual manufacturing capacity of mwh 
during 
table of contents december  we qualified the first production line at our livonia facility and we expect to qualify our romulus facility during the first half of also  we have put into place manufacturing overhead  including supply chain and quality organizations  which are sized to support significantly higher production volumes than we are currently producing 
increasing our production volume will allow us to reduce per unit cell costs  improve the absorption of manufacturing overhead costs  and improve our gross margins 
however  pending the qualification and production ramp up at our michigan facilities  we are currently producing cells in a low volume pilot production plant 
utilizing a pilot production plant imposes capacity constraints  limiting our ability to produce at higher volumes and decrease our per unit cost of goods sold  thereby contributing to our negative gross margins 
as we ramp up production at our michigan facilities  we anticipate a significant increase in production volumes and therefore lower per unit costs 
our long term financial objective is to achieve and support sustained profitable growth 
to meet this objective  we are currently focusing on completing the expansion of our manufacturing capacity and increasing production volumes to achieve lower material costs due to volume purchase discounts and improved absorption of our manufacturing overhead costs  thereby reducing per unit production cost 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of research  development and engineering  sales and marketing  general and administrative and production start up expenses 
personnel related expenses comprise the most significant component of these expenses 
we expect to hire a significant number of new employees in order to support our anticipated growth 
in any particular period  the timing of additional hires could materially affect our operating expenses  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
during the third quarter of  we opened our manufacturing facility in livonia  michigan  and our livonia facility was qualified for production in december the romulus facility is expected to begin qualification for production in the first quarter of we anticipate increases in operating expenses  specifically  facility related expenses and personnel related expenses due to an increase in headcount at our livonia and romulus facilities  in future periods as we ramp to full production in both locations 
research  development and engineering expenses 
research  development and engineering expenses consist primarily of expenses for personnel engaged in the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products  as well as lab materials  quality assurance activities and facilities costs and other related overhead 
these expenses also include pre production costs related to long term supply agreements unless reimbursement from the customer is contractually guaranteed 
pre production costs consist of engineering  design and development costs for products sold under long term supply arrangements 
we expense all of our research  development and engineering costs as they are incurred 
in the near term  we expect research  development and engineering expenses to increase in large part due to personnel related expenses as we seek to hire additional employees  as well as contract related expenses as we continue to invest in the development of our products 
research  development and engineering expense is reported net of any funding received under contracts with governmental agencies and commercial customers that are considered to be cost sharing arrangements with no contractually committed deliverable 
accordingly  we expect that our research  development and engineering expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  travel and other out of pocket expenses for marketing programs  such as trade shows  industry conferences  marketing materials and corporate communications  and facilities costs and other related overhead 
we intend to hire additional sales personnel  initiate additional marketing programs 
table of contents and build additional relationships with resellers  systems integrators and strategic partners on a global basis 
accordingly  we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses related to our executive  legal  finance  human resource and information technology functions  as well as fees for professional services and allocated facility overhead expenses 
professional services consist principally of external legal  accounting  tax  audit and other consulting services 
we expect to continue to incur general and administrative expenses related to operating as a publicly traded company  including increased audit and legal fees  costs of compliance with securities  corporate governance and other regulations  investor relations expenses and higher insurance premiums  particularly those related to director and officer insurance 
in addition  we expect to incur additional costs as we hire personnel and enhance our infrastructure to support the anticipated growth of our business 
accordingly  we expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term 
production start up expenses 
production start up expenses consist of salaries and personnel related costs  site selection costs  including legal and regulatory costs  rent and the cost of operating a production line before it is qualified for production  including the cost of raw materials run through the production line during the qualification phase 
we expect to incur additional production start up expenses related to our facilities in romulus  michigan in the near term 
the livonia facility began qualification for production in the third quarter of the romulus facility is expected to begin qualification for production in the first quarter of other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income on cash balances  interest expense on borrowings  change in fair value of preferred stock warrants  foreign currency related gains and losses  equity earnings and gain on long term investment 
we have historically invested our cash in money market investments 
our interest income will vary each reporting period depending on our average cash balances during the period and the current level of interest rates 
similarly  our foreign currency related gains and losses will also vary depending upon movements in underlying exchange rates 
upon the closing of our ipo  all preferred stock warrants were converted to common stock warrants and we do not expect any gains or losses related to the change in the fair value of preferred stock warrants going forward 
other income includes equity losses related of our proportional share of earnings in investments accounted for under the equity method and will vary each reporting period depending on the earnings or losses of these entities and gains or losses on long term investments will vary each reporting period depending on the timing of any joint ventures or other equity investments we may enter into  the investment made by us  and the ongoing operations of the investee 
provision for income taxes 
through december   we incurred net losses since inception and have not recorded provisions for us federal income taxes since the tax benefits of our net losses have been offset by valuation allowances 
we have recorded a tax provision for foreign taxes associated with our foreign subsidiaries and state income taxes where our net operating loss deductions are limited by statutes 
certain trends and uncertainties the following represents a summary of certain trends and uncertainties  which could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
this summary is not intended to be a complete list of potential trends and uncertainties that could impact our business in the long or short term 
the summary  however  should be considered along with the factors identified in the 
table of contents section titled risk factors set forth in part i  item a of this annual report on form k and elsewhere in this report 
we believe that our future revenues depend on our ability to develop  manufacture and market products that improve upon existing battery technology and gain market acceptance 
if our battery technology is not adopted by our customers  or if our battery technology does not meet industry requirements for power and energy storage capacity in an efficient and safe design  our batteries will not gain market acceptance 
we build our manufacturing capacity based on estimated demand from existing supply agreements  from our projection of future development and supply agreement wins and from anticipated timelines of customer orders 
increases in production capacity  have had  and will continue to have  an effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our business revenues and profits will depend upon our ability to enter into and complete development and supply agreements  successfully complete these capacity expansion projects  achieve competitive manufacturing yields and drive volume sales consistent with our demand expectations 
our revenues are expected to continue to come from a relatively small number of customers for the foreseeable future 
the loss of one of our two most significant customers  several of our smaller customers  or one of our existing supply agreements for significant future revenues  could materially harm our business 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expense and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue once it is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
product revenue is generally recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is generally upon shipment  unless an acceptance period or other contingency exists 
in general  our customary shipping terms are fob shipping point or free carrier 
in instances where customer acceptance of a product is required  revenue is either recognized upon the shipment when we are able to demonstrate the customer specific objective criteria have been met or the earlier of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
services revenue is recognized as services are performed consistent with the performance requirements of the contract using the proportional performance method 
where arrangements include milestones or governmental approval that impact the fees payable to us  revenue is limited to those amounts whereby collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue earned under time and 
table of contents materials contracts as services are provided based upon actual costs incurred plus a contractually agreed upon profit margin 
we recognize revenue from fixed price contracts  using the proportional performance method based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimates of total expected project costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date 
project costs are based on the direct salary and associated fringe benefits of the employees on the project plus all direct expenses incurred to complete the project that are not reimbursed by the client 
the proportional performance method is used since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
these estimates are based on historical experience and deliverables identified in the contract and are indicative of the level of benefit provided to our clients 
there are no costs that are deferred and amortized over the contract term 
if sales arrangements contain multiple elements  we determine if separate units of accounting exist within the arrangement 
if separate units of accounting exist within an arrangement  we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements 
fees to license the use of our proprietary and licensed technologies are recognized only after both the license period has commenced and the technology has been delivered to the customer 
royalty revenue is recognized when it becomes determinable and collectability is reasonably assured  otherwise we recognize revenue upon receipt of payment 
to date  we have not recognized any material license or royalty revenue 
because of the nature of our products  revenue recognition is based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors 
this can lead to significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual revenues 
product warranty obligations we accrue for product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based on the historical rate of claims and costs to provide warranty services 
our standard warranty period extends one to eight years from the date of sale  depending on the type of product purchased and its application 
our estimates of the amounts necessary to settle warranty claims are based primarily on our past experience 
for our new products and products that remain under development  we will be required to base our warranty estimates on historical experience of similar products  testing of our batteries and battery systems  and performance information learned during our development activities with the customer 
although we believe our estimates are adequate and that the judgment we apply is appropriate  actual warranty costs could differ materially from our estimates 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims above historical experience or our costs to provide warranty services increase  we would be required to increase our warranty accrual  and our cost of revenue would increase 
if we are unable to estimate warranty costs we would defer recognizing revenue until we can make that determination 
inventory we carry our inventory at the lower of historical cost or net realizable value assuming inventory items are consumed on a first in  first out basis 
we recognize inventory losses based on obsolescence and levels in excess of forecasted demand 
in these cases  inventory is written down to the estimated realizable value based on historical usage and expected demand 
inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends  future demand for our products and technical obsolescence of our products 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs could be required and would be reflected in the cost of revenue in the period the revision is made 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate our long lived assets for events and circumstances that indicate a potential impairment 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset as compared to the recorded value of the asset 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges against these assets in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined 
as a result of the decline in revenue from our korean subsidiary and the termination of the supply agreement with its largest customer  we concluded that impairment indicators existed 
as a result  we reviewed our long lived assets associated with the production of small prismatic batteries and recorded million   and million of impairment charges in the years ended december   and  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded  million and a million  respectively  of impairment charges related to impaired equipment at our china facility 
government grants we recognize government grants when there is a reasonable assurance that we will comply with the conditions attached to the grant arrangement and the grant will be received 
for reimbursements of expenses  the government grants are recognized as reduction of the related expense 
for reimbursements of capital expenditures  the grants are recognized as a reduction of the basis of the asset 
the grant is recognized in profit or loss over the life of a depreciable asset as reduced depreciation expense 
we record government grant receivables in current or long term assets depending on when the amounts are expected to be received from the government agency 
we do not discount long term grant receivables 
when funding is received in advance of complying with certain conditions  we recognize a liability and restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets until such time as the funding has been spent 
investments in non public companies our investments held in non public companies are considered a critical accounting policy because these investments expose us to equity price risk 
as of december   non publicly traded investments of million are accounted for using the cost method and million are accounted for using the equity method 
strategic investments in third parties are subject to risk of changes in market value  which if determined to be other than temporary  could result in realized impairment losses  which could be material 
we generally do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure in cost or equity method investments 
we regularly monitor these non publicly traded investments for impairment and record reductions in the carrying values when necessary 
circumstances that indicate an other than temporary decline include valuation ascribed to the issuing company in subsequent financing rounds  decreases in quoted market price and declines in operations of the issuer 
there can be no assurance that cost or equity method investments will not face risks of loss

table of contents were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  cost of services revenues 
the increase in costs of services revenue resulted from the increase in services revenues in addition to the mix of government and non government contracts for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  product gross profit loss 
we experienced a product gross loss during the year ended december   primarily due to low factory utilization 
our future gross profit will be affected by numerous factors  including the build out of our manufacturing capacity  the timing of the production of new product designs  and our ability to reduce cell costs 
for example  unabsorbed manufacturing expenses were million during the year ended december  as a result  our gross profit or loss will vary significantly from period to period going forward 
in addition  gross profit decreased due to an unfavorable change in the mix of products sold in the year ended december  as the year ended december  included a higher ratio of prismatic cell products to cylindrical cell products  as compared to the year ended december  services gross profit 
services gross profit decreased due to the mix of government and non government contracts in the year ended december   as the year ended december  included a greater percentage of higher margin contracts

the decrease in net foreign exchange gains for the year ended december  is due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes  in particular changes in the us dollar korean won exchange rate 
the decrease in unrealized loss on preferred stock warrant liability was due to the conversion of the preferred stock warrants to common stock warrants in connection with our ipo 
other income is due to losses recognized on our chinese joint venture and our investment in m technologies  inc  or m  a privately held company  both accounted for under the equity method

the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the total debt outstanding and additional borrowings which occurred between december  and december  the increase in net foreign exchange gains for the year ended december  is due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on transactions that are non us dollar denominated and charged or credited to earnings  particularly the favorable change in korean won to us dollar foreign exchange rates 
the increase in unrealized loss on preferred stock warrant liability was due to the increase in the fair market value of our stock 
as of december   all preferred stock warrants have been converted to common stock warrants and we do not expect any gains or losses on the change in fair value of preferred stock warrants in future periods

liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through private placements of preferred stock  common stock  convertible promissory notes  demand notes  term loans  credit facilities and our initial public offering 
during the year ended december   we received million from government grant proceeds 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and accounts receivable of million 

table of contents the company available sources of cash primarily include the cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from government grants 
to fund our growth and expansion plans  including anticipated future losses  purchase commitments  and capital expenditures  we will need to raise additional capital in the next twelve months 
we make investments in manufacturing capacity up to months prior to the time we need it to meet customer demand and therefore must plan funding accordingly 
however  if customer demand exceeds our current plans  we may need to raise further capital  beyond current expectations  to achieve our expected growth 
we believe that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to implement our current expansion plans in however  if we are unable to raise additional capital  our growth potential may be adversely affected and we will have to modify our plans 
if we were to reduce the pace of implementing our expansion plans  we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents would be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months 
we have also applied for various state and federal loan and grant programs  as discussed in detail in the government initiatives and contract research section in item of this annual report on form k  including the million doe grant we were awarded to fund the construction of our lithium ion battery manufacturing facilities in michigan 
we also believe we will be permitted to borrow up to million under the atvm program to support this manufacturing expansion 
under the doe battery initiative  we are required to spend up to one dollar of our own funds for every incentive dollar we receive  and we expect we will be required to spend one dollar of our own funds for every four dollars we borrow under the atvm program 
the timing and the amount of any loan we may receive under the atvm program  as well as the specific terms and conditions applicable to any loan we may receive  are currently not known by us  and  once disclosed to us  are subject to change and negotiation with the federal government 
access to these funds could offset some of our future capital needs 
the future capital requirements that may be required to support expanded manufacturing capacity  product testing capabilities  and working capital could be significant over the next several years 
if we are unable to access additional capital  our growth will be limited due to the inability to invest in additional manufacturing capacity 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures were million in  million for and million for in and beyond  we expect to use a significant portion of our cash for capital expenditures to increase manufacturing capacity in anticipation of increased demand for our products  including the current expansion of our manufacturing facilities in michigan

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
as a result of our foreign operations  we have significant expenses  assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies 
a significant number of our employees are located in asia 
therefore  a substantial portion of our payroll as well as certain other operating expenses are paid in the china rmb and south korean won 
additionally  we purchase materials and components from suppliers in asia 
while we pay these suppliers in us dollars  their costs are typically based upon the local currency of the country in which they operate 
all of our revenues are received in us dollars because our customer contracts generally provide that our customers will pay us in us dollars 
as a consequence  our gross profit  operating results  profitability and cash flows are adversely impacted when the dollar depreciates relative to other foreign currencies 
we have a particularly significant currency rate exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the rmb and south korean won to the us dollar 
for example  to the extent that we need to convert us dollars for our operations  appreciation of the rmb or south korean won against the us dollar would have an adverse effect on the amount we receive from the conversion 
we have not used any forward contracts or currency borrowings to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
interest rate sensitivity 
we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million as of december   and million as of december  our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to the interest income generated by excess cash invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the original dates of purchase 
the cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we have not been exposed  nor do we anticipate being exposed  to material risks due to changes in market interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income 
if overall interest rates had declined by up to basis points during the years ended december  and  our interest income would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  assuming consistent investment levels 
interest rate risk also refers to our exposure to movements in interest rates associated with our interest bearing liabilities 
the interest bearing liabilities are denominated in us dollars and the interest expense is based on the prime interest rate plus an additional margin  depending on the respective lending institutions 
if the prime rate had increased by basis points during the years ended december  and  our interest expense would have increased by approximately million each period  assuming consistent borrowing levels
