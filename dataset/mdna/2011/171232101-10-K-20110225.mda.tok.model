critical accounting estimates and judgements the consolidated financial statements include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of management for transactions that are not yet complete 
such estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts in the financial statements 
those estimates and judgments that were most critical to the preparation of the financial statements involved the determination of loss reserves and the recoverability of related reinsurance recoverables and the evaluation of whether a decline in value of any investment is temporary or other than temporary 
these estimates and judgments  which are discussed within the following analysis of our results of operations  require the use of assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and therefore are subject to change as facts and circumstances develop 
if different estimates and judgments had been applied  materially different amounts might have been reported in the financial statements 

table of contents overview the following highlights do not address all of the matters covered in the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or contain all of the information that may be important to chubb s shareholders or the investing public 
this overview should be read in conjunction with the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
net income was billion in both and and billion in net income was similar in and as lower operating income in was offset by higher net realized investment gains 
we define operating income as net income excluding realized investment gains and losses after tax 
the increase in net income in compared with was due to both higher operating income in compared with and modest net realized investment gains in compared with substantial net realized investment losses in operating income was billion in  billion in and billion in the lower operating income in compared with that in was due to lower underwriting income in our property and casualty insurance business  attributable in large part to a higher impact of catastrophes 
higher operating income in compared with that in was due to higher underwriting income in our property and casualty insurance business offset in part by lower investment income 
management uses operating income  a non gaap financial measure  among other measures  to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any period could be discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly  which could distort the analysis of operating trends 
underwriting results were highly profitable in  and our combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in and in the less profitable results in compared to were due to a substantially higher impact of catastrophes 
the more profitable results in compared to were due to a substantially lower impact of catastrophe losses offset in part by a lower amount of favorable prior year loss development 
the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined ratio in compared with of a percentage point in and percentage points in during  we experienced overall favorable development of million on loss reserves established as of the previous year end  due primarily to favorable loss experience in certain professional liability  commercial liability and personal insurance classes 
during and  we experienced overall favorable development of million and million  respectively  due primarily to favorable loss experience in certain professional liability and commercial liability classes as well as lower than expected emergence of losses in the homeowners and commercial property classes 
total net premiums written increased by in and decreased by in growth in net premiums written in both years was limited by the general economic downturn and our continued emphasis on underwriting discipline in a market environment that remained competitive 
premium growth in benefited slightly from the impact of currency fluctuation on business written outside the united states 
the decrease in compared with was attributable to the general downturn in the economy and  to a lesser extent  to the impact of currency fluctuation on business written outside the united states due to the strength of the us dollar in compared to net premiums written in the united states decreased by in and in net premiums written outside the united states increased by in and decreased by in measured in local currencies  premiums outside the united states grew modestly in both years 
property and casualty investment income after tax increased by in and decreased by in the increase in reflected the positive effect of currency fluctuation on income from our non us investments  in what continued to be a low yield investment environment 
the decline in was due to lower yields  particularly on short term investments  as well as the negative effect of currency fluctuation on income from our non us investments 
management uses 
table of contents property and casualty investment income after tax  a non gaap financial measure  to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax 
net realized investment gains before tax were million million after tax in compared with net realized gains before tax of million million after tax in and net realized losses before tax of million million after tax in the net realized gains in were primarily related to investments in limited partnerships  which generally are reported on a quarter lag 
the net realized losses in were primarily attributable to other than temporary impairment losses on equity securities 
a summary of our consolidated net income is as follows years ended december in millions property and casualty insurance corporate and other consolidated operating income before income tax federal and foreign income tax consolidated operating income realized investment gains losses after income tax consolidated net income property and casualty insurance a summary of the results of operations of our property and casualty insurance business is as follows years ended december in millions underwriting net premiums written decrease increase in unearned premiums premiums earned losses and loss expenses operating costs and expenses decrease increase in deferred policy acquisition costs dividends to policyholders underwriting income investments investment income before expenses investment expenses investment income other income charges property and casualty income before tax property and casualty investment income after tax 
table of contents property and casualty income before tax was lower in than in due to lower underwriting income 
the decrease in underwriting income in was primarily the result of a higher impact of catastrophes during  offset in part by a modest increase in underwriting profitability excluding the impact of catastrophes in the current accident year 
investment income in was slightly higher than in property and casualty income before tax was higher in than in due to higher underwriting income  offset in part by lower investment income 
the increase in underwriting income in was primarily due to a substantially lower impact of catastrophes  offset in part by a lower amount of favorable prior year loss development and a slight reduction in underwriting profitability excluding the impact of catastrophes in the current accident year 
the decrease in investment income in was due to lower yields  particularly on short term investments  as well as the effects of currency fluctuation on income from our non us investments 
the profitability of our property and casualty insurance business depends on the results of both our underwriting and investment operations 
we view these as two distinct operations since the underwriting functions are managed separately from the investment function 
accordingly  in assessing our performance  we evaluate underwriting results separately from investment results 
underwriting operations underwriting results we evaluate the underwriting results of our property and casualty insurance business in the aggregate and also for each of our separate business units 
net premiums written net premiums written amounted to billion in  billion in and billion in net premiums written by business unit were as follows years ended december increase decrease decrease vs 
vs 
dollars in millions personal insurance commercial insurance specialty insurance total insurance reinsurance assumed total net premiums written increased by in compared with and decreased by in compared with premiums in the united states  which represent about of our total net premiums  decreased by in and in premiums outside the us  expressed in us dollars  increased by in and decreased by in in  the increase in net premiums written outside the us was largely attributable to the impact of the weaker us dollar relative to several currencies in which we wrote business in compared to as a result  overall premium growth in benefited slightly from the impact of currency fluctuation on business written outside the us in  the decrease in net premiums written outside the us was attributable to the impact of currency fluctuation due to the strength of the us dollar 
in and  net premiums written outside the us grew modestly when measured in local currencies 
premium growth was adversely impacted in both and by the general downturn in the economy which began in and continued through the amounts of coverage purchased or the insured exposures  both of which are bases upon which we calculate the premiums we charge  were down slightly or were flat for many classes of business in compared to in  the amounts of 
table of contents coverage purchased or insured exposures were generally down in most classes of business compared to also  in both and  our ability to grow premiums was constrained by our emphasis on underwriting discipline in the highly competitive market environment 
in  the competitive environment placed pressure on renewal rates overall renewal rates in the commercial and professional liability businesses were down slightly 
in  the competitive pressures were significant but renewal rates in the commercial and professional liability businesses increased slightly overall 
in and  we retained a high percentage of our existing customers and renewed those accounts at what we believe are acceptable rates relative to the risks 
the percentage of accounts we successfully retained on renewal was higher for most classes of business in compared with obtaining desirable new business was a challenge in both years 
the overall level of new business improved slightly in over levels  as a modest increase in new commercial business was offset to a small extent by a decline in new professional liability business 
in  the slow improvement in the economic environment and the highly competitive market continued to make it difficult to obtain new business 
the overall level of new business was down in compared with  consistent with the decrease in demand in nearly all classes of our business caused by the general economic downturn 
the highly competitive market is likely to continue in although there were some signs during that the economy was improving  it remains uncertain whether the improvement will continue and will be sustained 
even if an economic recovery does occur  any resulting growth in premiums will lag any recovery that takes place 
we expect our net written premiums will be flat or slightly higher in compared with  assuming average foreign currency to us dollar exchange rates in remain similar to year end levels 
reinsurance assumed net premiums written decreased by in and in this business has been in run off since the sale of our ongoing reinsurance assumed business in december reinsurance ceded our premiums written are net of amounts ceded to reinsurers who assume a portion of the risk under the insurance policies we write that are subject to the reinsurance 
most of our ceded reinsurance arrangements consist of excess of loss and catastrophe contracts that protect against a specified part or all of certain types of losses over stipulated amounts arising from any one occurrence or event 
therefore  unless we incur losses that exceed our initial retention under these contracts  we do not receive any loss recoveries 
as a result  in certain years  we cede premiums to reinsurance companies and receive few  if any  loss recoveries 
however  in a year in which there is a significant catastrophic event or a series of large individual losses  we may receive substantial loss recoveries 
the impact of ceded reinsurance on net premiums written and net premiums earned and on net losses and loss expenses incurred for the three years ended december  is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the most significant component of our ceded reinsurance program is property reinsurance 
we purchase two types of property reinsurance catastrophe and property per risk 
for property risks in the united states and canada  we purchase catastrophe reinsurance in two forms 
we purchase traditional catastrophe reinsurance  including our primary treaty which we refer to as our north american catastrophe treaty  as well as supplemental catastrophe reinsurance that provides additional coverage for our northeast united states exposures 
we have also arranged for the purchase of multi year  collateralized reinsurance coverage funded through the issuance of collateralized risk linked securities  known as catastrophe bonds 
our north american catastrophe treaty has an initial retention of million 
the combination of the north american catastrophe treaty and a portion of the catastrophe bond coverages generally provide coverage for united states and canadian exposures of approximately of losses net of recoveries from other available reinsurance between million and billion and of losses between billion and billion 
for catastrophe events in the northeastern part of the united states and in florida  the combination of the north american catastrophe treaty  the supplemental catastrophe reinsurance and the catastrophe bond coverages provide additional coverages as discussed below 

table of contents the catastrophe bond coverages generally provide reinsurance coverage for specific types of losses in specific geographic locations 
they are generally designed to supplement coverage provided under the north american catastrophe treaty 
we currently have three catastrophe bond coverages in effect a million reinsurance arrangement that expires in april that provides coverage for homeowners related hurricane losses in the northeastern part of the united states  a million reinsurance arrangement that expires in march that provides coverage for homeowners and commercial exposures for loss events in the northeastern part of the united states for losses occurring elsewhere in the continental united states or canada  the coverage is limited to million  and a million reinsurance arrangement that expires in march that provides coverage for homeowners related hurricane losses in florida 
for catastrophic events in the northeastern part of the united states  the combination of the north american catastrophe treaty  the supplemental catastrophe reinsurance and certain catastrophe bond coverages provide additional coverage of approximately of losses net of recoveries from other available reinsurance between billion and billion  approximately of losses between billion and billion  and approximately of homeowners related hurricane losses between billion and billion 
for hurricane events in florida  we have reinsurance from the florida hurricane catastrophe fund fhcf  which is a state mandated fund designed to reimburse insurers for a portion of their residential catastrophic hurricane losses 
our participation in this program limits our initial retention in florida for homeowners related losses to approximately million and provides coverage of of covered losses between approximately million and million 
additionally  certain catastrophe bond coverages provide coverage of approximately of florida homeowners related hurricane losses between million and billion 
our primary property catastrophe treaty for events outside the united states provides coverage of approximately of losses net of recoveries from other available reinsurance between million and million 
in addition to catastrophe treaties  we also have a commercial property per risk treaty 
this treaty provides up to approximately million depending upon the currency in which the insurance policy was issued of coverage per risk in excess of our initial retention  which is generally between million and million 
in addition to our major property catastrophe and property per risk treaties  we purchase several smaller property treaties that only cover specific classes of business or locations having potential concentrations of risk 
recoveries under our property reinsurance treaties are subject to certain coinsurance requirements that affect the interaction of some elements of our reinsurance program 
our property reinsurance treaties generally contain terrorism exclusions for acts perpetrated by foreign terrorists  and for nuclear  biological  chemical and radiological loss causes whether such acts are perpetrated by foreign or domestic terrorists 
after increasing somewhat in  due to capacity restrictions for certain coverages in the market  reinsurance rates for property risks generally decreased in consequently  the overall cost of our property reinsurance program was modestly lower in than in we do not expect the changes we made to our reinsurance program during to have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
our major  traditional property reinsurance treaties expire on april  and we are in the process of evaluating our property reinsurance program 
despite significant natural disaster losses to the industry in early  lower than average hurricane related catastrophe losses to the industry in lead us to expect that reinsurance rates for property risks will decrease somewhat in the final structure of our reinsurance program and amount of coverage purchased  including the mixture of traditional catastrophe reinsurance and collateralized reinsurance coverage funded through the issuance of collateralized risk linked securities  will be the determinants of our total reinsurance costs in 
table of contents profitability the combined loss and expense ratio  expressed as a percentage  is the key measure of underwriting profitability traditionally used in the property and casualty insurance business 
management evaluates the performance of our underwriting operations and of each of our business units using  among other measures  the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles 
it is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned loss ratio plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written expense ratio after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders 
when the combined ratio is under  underwriting results are generally considered profitable  when the combined ratio is over  underwriting results are generally considered unprofitable 
statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
under statutory accounting principles  policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately  not at the time premiums are earned 
management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with gaap  among other measures  to assess the overall performance of our underwriting operations 
to convert statutory underwriting results to a gaap basis  policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
underwriting income determined in accordance with gaap is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and gaap underwriting expenses incurred 
underwriting results were highly profitable in each of the last three years 
the combined loss and expense ratio for our overall property and casualty business was as follows years ended december loss ratio expense ratio combined loss and expense ratio the relatively low loss ratio in each of the last three years reflected the favorable loss experience which we believe resulted from our disciplined underwriting in recent years 
results in all three years benefited from favorable prior year loss development 
for more information on prior year loss development  see property and casualty insurance loss reserves  prior year loss development 
the loss ratio was higher in compared to due primarily to a higher impact of catastrophes  offset in part by a modest decrease in the current accident year loss ratio excluding catastrophes 
the amount of favorable prior year loss development was slightly lower in compared with the loss ratio was lower in compared to due to a lower impact from catastrophes  offset in part by a lower amount of favorable prior year loss development and a slight increase in the current accident year loss ratio excluding catastrophes 
in  the impact of catastrophes was million  which represented percentage points of the combined ratio 
a significant portion of the catastrophe losses in related to numerous storms in the united states and  to a lesser extent  the earthquake in chile 
the impact of catastrophes was million in and million in  which represented percentage points and percentage points  respectively  of the combined ratio 
about million of the catastrophe losses in related to hurricane ike  including our estimated share of an assessment from the texas windstorm insurance association 
we did not have any recoveries from our primary catastrophe reinsurance treaties during the three year period ended december  because there was no individual catastrophe for which our losses exceeded our retention under the treaties 
under a region specific property catastrophe reinsurance treaty  we expect to recover about million of our gross losses related to the earthquake in chile 

table of contents our expense ratio was higher in compared with  which in turn was higher compared with the increase in was due to an increase in commissions and  to a lesser extent  overhead expenses increasing at a rate that exceeded the rate of growth of premiums written 
commissions were higher primarily outside the united states due  in part  to premium growth in classes of business with higher commission rates 
the increase in was due primarily to an increase in commission rates in certain classes of business in the united states and  to a lesser extent  a decline in premiums written at a rate that exceeded the rate of reduction in our overhead expenses 
review of underwriting results by business unit personal insurance net premiums written from personal insurance  which represented of our premiums written in  increased by in and decreased by in compared with the respective prior years 
net premiums written for the classes of business within the personal insurance segment were as follows years ended december increase decrease vs

personal automobile premiums in the us decreased slightly in personal automobile premiums decreased in due to a highly competitive us marketplace as well as the negative impact of currency fluctuation on business written outside the united states 
premiums for our homeowners business increased slightly in after decreasing in premium growth in this business was constrained in both and due to the downturn in the us economy that began in  which resulted in a slowdown in new housing construction as well as lower demand for jewelry and fine arts policy endorsements 
premiums from our other personal business  which includes insurance for accident and health  excess liability and yacht  increased in after a decrease in the growth in was primarily in our non us accident business and approximately half was attributable to the effect of currency fluctuation 
the decrease in was driven by our accident and health business  due primarily to the effect of currency fluctuation on the non us component of this business 
the adverse impact of currency fluctuation in was offset in part by growth in the us component of this business  due primarily to a select initiative 
excess liability premiums grew modestly in and were flat in our personal insurance business produced highly profitable underwriting results in each of the last three years  but less so in due to the impact of significantly higher homeowners catastrophe losses 
a significant portion of the catastrophe losses in related to numerous storms in the united states in the first half of the year 
the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within the personal insurance segment were as follows years ended december automobile homeowners other total personal 
table of contents our personal automobile results were profitable in each of the past three years 
results in all three years benefited from modest favorable prior year loss development and generally lower claim frequency 
homeowners results were highly profitable in each of the last three years  but less so in due to higher catastrophe losses 
the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in results in and were adversely impacted by a higher frequency and severity of large non catastrophe losses

dollars in millions multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial growth in our commercial classes in was limited by a very competitive marketplace and the restrained insurance purchasing demand of customers operating in weakened economies worldwide 
net premiums written in reflected slightly reduced exposures on renewal business in the us due to the continuing effects of the weak economy  although the effect on renewal exposures progressively lessened throughout the year 
on average  renewal rates in the united states for most classes of commercial insurance business were about flat in compared with premium growth in in our commercial insurance business benefited slightly from the impact of currency fluctuation on business written outside the united states 
the decrease in premiums in our commercial insurance business in was primarily attributable to the adverse effects of the economic downturn and  to a lesser extent  the negative impact of currency fluctuation on business written outside the united states 
the decline in premiums in most of our commercial classes in also reflected the highly competitive marketplace  particularly for new business 
the decrease in workers compensation premiums in reflected reduced exposures  due to lower amounts of covered payroll of our insureds  largely as a result of the downturn in the us economy 
overall us renewal rates were up slightly in for commercial insurance 
retention levels of our existing customers remained strong over the last three years 
new business volume was up modestly in compared with new business volume was down in compared with although we obtained some new business in as a result of the dislocation in the insurance markets caused by the impact of the financial market crisis on some of our competitors  new business declined overall in due to continued competitive conditions and the general reduction in insurance demand due to the effects of the economic downturn

the liability component deteriorated in compared to due to margin compression in the current accident year  as rate changes did not keep pace with the projected costs 
substantial improvement in the property component of the multiple peril business in compared with  due to lower catastrophe losses  was offset by less profitable results in the liability component  due in part to a lower amount of favorable prior year loss development 
the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio for the multiple peril class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in the property component benefited from low non catastrophe losses in all three years  particularly outside the united states in both and results for our casualty business were profitable in each of the past three years  but more so in the automobile component of our casualty business was modestly profitable in and compared with highly profitable results in results in the primary liability component were profitable in each of the past three years  but less so in each succeeding year  as earned rate levels did not keep pace with the projected costs 
results in the excess liability component were highly profitable in each of the past three years  but more so in while excess liability results in all three years benefited from favorable prior year loss development  the amount was highest in  mainly due to better than expected claim severity 
casualty results in all three years were adversely affected by incurred losses related to toxic waste claims

specialty insurance net premiums written from specialty insurance  which represented of our premiums written in  were flat in and decreased by in compared with the respective prior years 
net premiums written for the classes of business within the specialty insurance segment were as follows years ended december increase decrease decrease vs 
vs 
dollars in millions professional liability surety total specialty net premiums written in our professional liability business decreased in compared with due to the continuing effect of the economic downturn and a highly competitive marketplace 
a slight overall decrease in renewal rates and modestly reduced new business volume were partially offset by the effect of strong retention of our expiring policies in compared with premium growth in our professional liability business in benefited slightly from the impact of currency fluctuation on business written outside the united states 
the decrease in net premiums written in our professional liability classes of business in was due to several factors 
the continuation of the adverse effects of the economic downturn and a highly competitive marketplace in contributed to a modest decrease in retention levels  fewer attractive new business opportunities and fewer nonrecurring and merger and acquisition related coverage opportunities 
in addition  the negative impact of currency fluctuation on business written outside the united states contributed to the decline in premiums in overall renewal rates in our professional liability business in the us decreased slightly in after increasing slightly in rates were down in most lines of our professional liability business in  with the most significant reduction in rates in our directors and officers liability business 
rates for directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability insurance for financial institutions had increased in  particularly for those companies implicated in the crisis in the financial markets  but rates for those companies stabilized in retention levels in the professional liability classes remained strong over the last three years 
new business volume declined in each of the past two years  due in varying degrees to the competition in the marketplace as well as the effects of the economic downturn 
the decline in new business was greater in due to a decrease in demand for insurance resulting from the economic downturn  even though we obtained some new business as a result of the market dislocation in the insurance industry 
we maintained our focus on small and middle market publicly traded and privately held companies and our commitment to maintaining underwriting discipline in this environment 
we continued to obtain what we believe are acceptable rates and appropriate terms and conditions on both new and renewal business 
premium growth in our surety business was constrained in and by the competitive environment and the impact of the weaker economy on the construction business 
the slight growth in was attributable to new business in non us locations 

table of contents our specialty insurance business produced highly profitable underwriting results in each of the last three years 
the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within specialty insurance were as follows years ended december professional liability surety total specialty our professional liability business produced highly profitable results in each of the past three years 
the profitability of our professional liability business was particularly strong outside the united states in all three years 
the employment practices liability and fiduciary liability classes each produced highly profitable results in each of the three past years 
the directors and officers liability class was profitable in all three years  particularly in the fidelity class was profitable in each of the past three years  but less so in each successive year  due in part to increased large loss activity resulting from alleged third party and insured employee criminal activity in recent years 
our errors and omissions liability business produced highly unprofitable results in and compared with near breakeven results in due to the impact of the financial crisis related claims against financial institutions and differences in prior year loss development among the years 
collectively  the results for the professional liability classes benefited from favorable prior year loss development in each of the past three years due primarily to the recognition of the positive loss trends we have been experiencing related to accident years through these trends were largely the result of a favorable business climate  lower policy limits and better terms and conditions 
the combined ratio for the accident year in our professional liability business is modestly below breakeven  while the combined ratios for the and accident years were higher since those accident years were more affected by the crisis in the financial markets 
our surety business produced highly profitable results in each of the past three years due to favorable loss experience 
results in were less profitable than those in and due to the adverse impact of one large loss 
our surety business tends to be characterized by losses that are infrequent but have the potential to be highly severe 
when losses occur  they are mitigated  at times  by recovery rights to the customer s assets  contract payments  collateral and bankruptcy recoveries 
the majority of our surety obligations are intended to be performance based guarantees 
we manage our exposure by individual account and by specific bond type 
we have substantial commercial and construction surety exposure for current and prior customers  including exposures related to surety bonds issued on behalf of companies that have experienced deterioration in creditworthiness since we issued bonds to them 
we therefore may experience an increase in filed claims and may incur high severity losses  especially in light of ongoing economic conditions 
such losses would be recognized if and when claims are filed and determined to be valid  and could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations 
reinsurance assumed in  we transferred our ongoing reinsurance assumed business and certain related assets  including renewal rights  to a reinsurance company  harbor point limited  which merged into alterra capital holdings limited in may harbor point generally did not assume our reinsurance liabilities relating to reinsurance contracts incepting prior to december  we retained those liabilities and the related assets 
for a transition period of about two years  harbor point underwrote specific reinsurance business on our behalf 
we retained a portion of this business and ceded the balance to harbor point 
net premiums written from our reinsurance assumed business during the past three years have not been significant as this business is in run off 

table of contents reinsurance assumed results were profitable in each of the past three years 
prior year loss development was favorable in all three years  but more so in and catastrophe risk management our property and casualty subsidiaries have exposure to losses caused by natural perils such as hurricanes and other windstorms  earthquakes  severe winter weather and brush fires as well as from man made catastrophic events such as terrorism 
the frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
natural catastrophes the extent of losses from a natural catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in an area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
we regularly assess our concentration of risk exposures in natural catastrophe exposed areas globally and have strategies and underwriting standards to manage this exposure through individual risk selection  subject to regulatory constraints  and through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance 
we use catastrophe modeling and a risk concentration management tool to monitor and control our accumulations of potential losses in natural catastrophe exposed areas in the united states  such as california and the gulf and east coasts  as well as in natural catastrophe exposed areas in other countries 
the information provided by the catastrophe modeling and the risk concentration management tool has resulted in our non renewing some accounts and refraining from writing others 
actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the model 
we also continue to actively explore and analyze credible scientific evidence  including the potential impact of global climate change  that may affect our ability to manage exposure under the insurance policies we issue as well as the impact that laws and regulations intended to combat climate change may have on us 
despite these efforts  the occurrence of one or more severe natural catastrophic events in heavily populated areas could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
terrorism risk and legislation the september  attack changed the way the property and casualty insurance industry views catastrophic risk 
that tragic event demonstrated that numerous classes of business we write are subject to terrorism related catastrophic risks in addition to the catastrophic risks related to natural occurrences 
this  together with the limited availability of terrorism reinsurance  has required us to change how we identify and evaluate risk accumulations 
we have licensed a terrorism model that provides loss estimates under numerous event scenarios 
actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the model 
the risk concentration management tool referred to above also enables us to identify locations and geographic areas that are exposed to risk accumulations 
the information provided by the terrorism model and the risk concentration management tool has resulted in our non renewing some accounts  subject to regulatory constraints  and refraining from writing others 
the terrorism risk insurance act of and more recently  the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of collectively tria  are limited duration programs under which the us federal government has agreed to share the risk of loss arising from certain acts of terrorism with the insurance industry 
the current program  which will terminate on december   is applicable to many lines of commercial business but excludes  among others  commercial automobile  surety and professional liability insurance  other than directors and officers liability 
the current program provides protection from all foreign and domestic acts of terrorism 
as a precondition to recovery under tria  insurance companies with direct commercial insurance exposure in the united states for tria lines of business are required to make insurance for covered acts of terrorism available under their policies 
each insurer has a separate deductible that it must meet in the event of an act of terrorism before federal assistance becomes available 
the deductible is based on a percentage of direct us earned premiums for the covered lines of business in the previous calendar year 
for  that deductible is of direct premiums earned in for these lines of business 
for 
table of contents losses above the deductible  the federal government will pay for of covered losses  while the insurer retains 
there is a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of billion 
if acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the billion annual limit  insurers are not liable for additional losses 
while the provisions of tria will serve to mitigate our exposure in the event of a large scale terrorist attack  our deductible is substantial  approximating million in for certain classes of business  such as workers compensation  terrorism coverage is mandatory 
for those classes of business where it is not mandatory  policyholders may choose not to purchase terrorism coverage  which would  subject to other statutory or regulatory restrictions  reduce our exposure 
we also have exposure outside the united states to risk of loss from acts of terrorism 
in some jurisdictions  we have access to government mechanisms that would mitigate our exposure 
we will continue to manage this type of catastrophic risk by monitoring terrorism risk aggregations 
nevertheless  given the unpredictability of the targets  frequency and severity of potential terrorist events as well as the very limited terrorism reinsurance coverage available in the market and the limitations of existing government programs and uncertainty regarding their availability in the future  the occurrence of a terrorist event could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
loss reserves unpaid losses and loss expenses  also referred to as loss reserves  are the largest liability of our property and casualty subsidiaries 
our loss reserves include case estimates for claims that have been reported and estimates for claims that have been incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date as well as estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims  less estimates of anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries 
estimates are based upon past loss experience modified for current trends as well as prevailing economic  legal and social conditions 
our loss reserves are not discounted to present value 
we regularly review our loss reserves using a variety of actuarial techniques 
we update the reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops  additional claims are reported and or settled and new information becomes available 
any changes in estimates are reflected in operating results in the period in which the estimates are changed 
incurred but not reported ibnr reserve estimates are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate cost of all claims that have occurred and then subtracting reported losses and loss expenses 
reported losses include cumulative paid losses and loss expenses plus case reserves 
the ibnr reserve includes a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us  some of which are not yet known to the insured  as well as a provision for future development on reported claims 
a relatively large proportion of our net loss reserves  particularly for long tail liability classes  are reserves for ibnr losses 
in fact  more than of our aggregate net loss reserves at december  were for ibnr losses 

table of contents our gross case and ibnr loss reserves and related reinsurance recoverable by class of business were as follows net gross loss reserves reinsurance loss december  case ibnr total recoverable reserves in millions personal insurance automobile homeowners other total personal commercial insurance multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial specialty insurance professional liability surety total specialty total insurance reinsurance assumed total net gross loss reserves reinsurance loss december  case ibnr total recoverable reserves in millions personal insurance automobile homeowners other total personal commercial insurance multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial specialty insurance professional liability surety total specialty total insurance reinsurance assumed total 
table of contents loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  increased by million or in the effect of catastrophes increased loss reserves by about million and the effect of currency fluctuation decreased reserves by approximately million  due to the strength of the us dollar at december  compared to december  loss reserves related to our insurance business increased by million 
loss reserves related to our reinsurance assumed business  which is in run off  decreased by million 
total gross case reserves related to our insurance business decreased by million in a majority of this decrease was in the professional liability business primarily due to the settlement in of a significant number of large losses that were unpaid as of december  in establishing the loss reserves of our property and casualty subsidiaries  we consider facts currently known and the present state of the law and coverage litigation 
based on all information currently available  we believe that the aggregate loss reserves at december  were adequate to cover claims for losses that had occurred as of that date  including both those known to us and those yet to be reported 
however  as described below  there are significant uncertainties inherent in the loss reserving process 
it is therefore possible that management s estimate of the ultimate liability for losses that had occurred as of december  may change  which could have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations and financial condition 
estimates and uncertainties the process of establishing loss reserves is complex and imprecise as it must take into consideration many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events 
as a result  informed subjective estimates and judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process 
given the inherent complexity of the loss reserving process and the potential variability of the assumptions used  the actual emergence of losses could vary  perhaps substantially  from the estimate of losses included in our financial statements  particularly in those instances where settlements do not occur until well into the future 
our net loss reserves at december  were billion 
therefore  a relatively small percentage change in the estimate of net loss reserves would have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations 
reserves other than those relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
our loss reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail classes of business 
tail refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the settlement of the claim 
the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim  the more the ultimate settlement amount can vary 
short tail classes consist principally of homeowners  commercial property and marine business 
for these classes  claims are generally reported and settled shortly after the loss occurs and the claims usually relate to tangible property 
consequently  the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is less complex 
most of our loss reserves relate to long tail liability classes of business 
long tail classes include directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability and other professional liability coverages  commercial primary and excess liability  workers compensation and other liability coverages 
for many liability claims significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of the loss  the reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the claim 
as a result  loss experience in the more recent accident years for the long tail liability classes has limited statistical credibility because a relatively small proportion of losses in these accident years are reported claims and an even smaller proportion are paid losses 
an accident year is the calendar year in which a loss is incurred or  in the case of claims made policies  the calendar year in which a loss is reported 
liability claims are also more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations and the legal and economic environment 
consequently  the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is more complex and typically subject to a higher degree of variability than for short tail classes 
as a result  the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates 

table of contents most of our reinsurance assumed business is long tail casualty reinsurance 
reserve estimates for this business are therefore subject to the variability caused by extended loss emergence periods 
the estimation of loss reserves for this business is further complicated by delays between the time the claim is reported to the ceding insurer and when it is reported by the ceding insurer to us and by our dependence on the quality and consistency of the loss reporting by the ceding company 
our actuaries perform a comprehensive review of loss reserves for each of the numerous classes of business we write at least once a year 
the timing of such review varies by class of business and  for some classes  the jurisdiction in which the policy was written 
the review process takes into consideration the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims in each particular class of business 
additionally  each quarter our actuaries review the emergence of paid and reported losses relative to expectations and  as necessary  conduct reserve reviews for particular classes of business 
the loss reserve estimation process relies on the basic assumption that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes 
as part of that process  our actuaries use a variety of actuarial methods that analyze experience  trends and other relevant factors 
the principal standard actuarial methods used by our actuaries in the loss reserve reviews include loss development factor methods  expected loss ratio methods  bornheutter ferguson methods and frequency severity methods 
loss development factor methods generally assume that the losses yet to emerge for an accident year are proportional to the paid or reported loss amounts observed so far 
historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses by accident year can be predictive of the expected future patterns that are applied to current paid and reported losses to generate estimated ultimate losses by accident year 
expected loss ratio methods use loss ratios for prior accident years  adjusted to reflect our evaluation of recent loss trends  the current risk environment  changes in our book of business and changes in our pricing and underwriting  to determine the appropriate expected loss ratio for a given accident year 
the expected loss ratio for each accident year is multiplied by the earned premiums for that year to calculate estimated ultimate losses 
bornheutter ferguson methods are combinations of an expected loss ratio method and a loss development factor method  where the loss development factor method is given more weight as an accident year matures 
frequency severity methods first project ultimate claim counts using one or more of the other methods described above and then multiply those counts by an estimated average claim cost to calculate estimated ultimate losses 
the average claim costs are often estimated through a regression analysis of historical severity data 
generally  these methods work best for high frequency  low severity classes of business 
in completing their loss reserve analysis  our actuaries are required to determine the most appropriate actuarial methods to employ for each class of business 
within each class  the business is further segregated by accident year and where appropriate by jurisdiction 
each estimation method has its own pattern  parameter and or judgmental dependencies  with no estimation method being better than the others in all situations 
the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various estimation methods when applied to a particular class of business can also change over time  depending on the underlying circumstances 
in many cases  multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the relevant class of business 
the manner of application and the degree of reliance on a given method will vary by class of business  by accident year and by jurisdiction based on our actuaries evaluation of the above dependencies and the potential volatility of the loss frequency and severity patterns 
the estimation methods selected or given weight by our actuaries at a particular valuation date are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication for the loss reserves being evaluated 
these selections incorporate input from claims personnel  pricing actuaries and underwriting management on loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates 

table of contents for short tail classes  the emergence of paid and incurred losses generally exhibits a reasonably stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next 
thus  for these classes  the loss development factor method is generally relatively straightforward to apply and usually requires only modest extrapolation 
for long tail classes  applying the loss development factor method often requires more judgment in selecting development factors as well as more significant extrapolation 
for those long tail classes with high frequency and relatively low per loss severity eg  workers compensation  volatility will often be sufficiently modest for the loss development factor method to be given significant weight  except in the most recent accident years 
for certain long tail classes of business  however  anticipated loss experience is less predictable because of the small number of claims and erratic claim severity patterns 
these classes include directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability and commercial excess liability  among others 
for these classes  the loss development factor methods may not produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses in the most recent accident years since many claims either have not yet been reported to us or are only in the early stages of the settlement process 
therefore  the actuarial estimates for these accident years are based on less extrapolatory methods  such as expected loss ratio and bornheutter ferguson methods 
over time  as a greater number of claims are reported and the statistical credibility of loss experience increases  loss development factor methods are given increasingly more weight 
using all the available data  our actuaries select an indicated loss reserve amount for each class of business based on the various assumptions  projections and methods 
the total indicated reserve amount determined by our actuaries is an aggregate of the indicated reserve amounts for the individual classes of business 
the ultimate outcome is likely to fall within a range of potential outcomes around this indicated amount  but the indicated amount is not expected to be precisely the ultimate liability 
senior management meets with our actuaries at the end of each quarter to review the results of the latest loss reserve analysis 
based on this review  management determines the carried reserve for each class of business 
in making the determination  management considers numerous factors  such as changes in actuarial indications in the period  the maturity of the accident year  trends observed over the recent past and the level of volatility within a particular class of business 
in doing so  management must evaluate whether a change in the data represents credible actionable information or an anomaly 
such an assessment requires considerable judgment 
even if a change is determined to be permanent  it is not always possible to determine the extent of the change until sometime later 
as a result  there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the carried loss reserves 
in general  changes are made more quickly to more mature accident years and less volatile classes of business 
among the numerous factors that contribute to the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing loss reserves are the following changes in the inflation rate for goods and services related to covered damages such as medical care and home repair costs  changes in the judicial interpretation of policy provisions relating to the determination of coverage  changes in the general attitude of juries in the determination of liability and damages  legislative actions  changes in the medical condition of claimants  changes in our estimates of the number and or severity of claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the date of the financial statements  changes in our book of business  changes in our underwriting standards  and changes in our claim handling procedures 

table of contents in addition  we must consider the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as legal  judicial and social conditions change 
these issues have had  and may continue to have  a negative effect on our loss reserves by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
examples of such issues include professional liability claims arising out of the recent crisis in the financial markets  directors and officers liability claims arising out of stock option backdating practices by certain public companies  directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability claims arising out of investment banking practices and accounting and other corporate malfeasance  and exposure to claims asserted for bodily injury as a result of long term exposure to harmful products or substances 
as a result of issues such as these  the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience have grown  further complicating the already complex loss reserving process 
as part of our loss reserving analysis  we take into consideration the various factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process 
those factors that could materially affect our loss reserve estimates include loss development patterns and loss cost trends  rate and exposure level changes  the effects of changes in coverage and policy limits  business mix shifts  the effects of regulatory and legislative developments  the effects of changes in judicial interpretations  the effects of emerging claims and coverage issues and the effects of changes in claim handling practices 
in making estimates of reserves  however  we do not necessarily make an explicit assumption for each of these factors 
moreover  all estimation methods do not utilize the same assumptions and typically no single method is determinative in the reserve analysis for a class of business 
consequently  changes in our loss reserve estimates generally are not the result of changes in any one assumption 
instead  the variability will be affected by the interplay of changes in numerous assumptions  many of which are implicit to the approaches used 
for each class of business  we regularly adjust the assumptions and actuarial methods used in the estimation of loss reserves in response to our actual loss experience as well as our judgments regarding changes in trends and or emerging patterns 
in those instances where we primarily utilize analyses of historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses this may be reflected  for example  in the selection of revised loss development factors 
in those long tail classes of business that comprise a majority of our loss reserves and for which loss experience is less predictable due to potential changes in judicial interpretations  potential legislative actions and potential claims issues  this may be reflected in a judgmental change in our estimate of ultimate losses for particular accident years 
the future impact of the various factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process is extremely difficult to predict 
there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves  particularly for long tail classes of business 
we do not derive statistical loss distributions or outcome confidence levels around our loss reserve estimate 
actuarial ranges of reasonable estimates are not a true reflection of the potential volatility between carried loss reserves and the ultimate settlement amount of losses incurred prior to the balance sheet date 
this is due  among other reasons  to the fact that actuarial ranges are developed based on known events as of the valuation date whereas the ultimate disposition of losses is subject to the outcome of events and circumstances that were unknown as of the valuation date 
the following discussion includes disclosure of possible variation from current estimates of loss reserves due to a change in certain key assumptions for particular classes of business 
these impacts are estimated individually  without consideration for any correlation among such assumptions or among lines of business 
therefore  it would be inappropriate to take the amounts and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for our loss reserves in total 
we believe that the estimated variation in reserves detailed below is a reasonable estimate of the possible variation that may occur in the future 
however  if such variation did occur  it would likely occur over a period of several years and therefore its impact on the corporation s results of operations would be spread over the same period 
it is important to note  however  that there is the potential for future variation greater than the amounts discussed below 

table of contents two of the larger components of our loss reserves relate to the professional liability classes other than fidelity and to commercial excess liability 
the respective reported loss development patterns are key assumptions in estimating loss reserves for these classes of business  both as applied directly to more mature accident years and as applied indirectly eg  via bornheutter ferguson methods to less mature accident years 
reserves for the professional liability classes other than fidelity were billion  net of reinsurance  at december  based on a review of our loss experience  if the loss development factor for each accident year changed such that the cumulative loss development factor for the most recent accident year changed by  we estimate that the net reserves for professional liability classes other than fidelity would change by approximately million  in either direction 
this degree of change in the reported loss development pattern is within the historical variation around the averages in our data 
reserves for commercial excess liability excluding asbestos and toxic waste claims were billion  net of reinsurance  at december  these reserves are included within commercial casualty 
based on a review of our loss experience  if the loss development factor for each accident year changed such that the cumulative loss development factor for the most recent accident year changed by  we estimate that the net reserves for commercial excess liability would change by approximately million  in either direction 
this degree of change in the reported loss development pattern is within the historical variation around the averages in our data 
reserves relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability 
the insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures 
reserves for asbestos and toxic waste claims cannot be estimated with traditional actuarial loss reserving techniques that rely on historical accident year loss development factors 
instead  we rely on an exposure based analysis that involves a detailed review of individual policy terms and exposures 
because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues  we generally evaluate our exposure on a policyholder by policyholder basis  considering a variety of factors that are unique to each policyholder 
quantitative techniques have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including management s judgment 
we establish case reserves and expense reserves for costs of related litigation where sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy 
in addition  ibnr reserves are established to cover additional exposures on both known and unasserted claims 
we believe that the loss reserves carried at december  for asbestos and toxic waste claims were adequate 
however  given the judicial decisions and legislative actions that have broadened the scope of coverage and expanded theories of liability in the past and the possibilities of similar interpretations in the future  it is possible that our estimate of loss reserves relating to these exposures may increase in future periods as new information becomes available and as claims develop 
asbestos reserves 
asbestos remains the most significant and difficult mass tort for the insurance industry in terms of claims volume and dollar exposure 
asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos 
tort theory affecting asbestos litigation has evolved over the years 
early court cases established the continuous trigger theory with respect to insurance coverage 
under this theory  insurance coverage is deemed to be triggered from the time a claimant is first exposed to asbestos until the manifestation of any disease 
this interpretation of a policy trigger can involve insurance policies over many years and increases insurance companies exposure to liability 
until recently  judicial interpretations and legislative actions attempted to maximize insurance availability from both a coverage and liability standpoint 

table of contents new asbestos claims and new exposures on existing claims have continued despite the fact that usage of asbestos has declined since the mid s 
many claimants were exposed to multiple asbestos products over an extended period of time 
as a result  claim filings typically name dozens of defendants 
the plaintiffs bar has solicited new claimants through extensive advertising and through asbestos medical screenings 
a vast majority of asbestos bodily injury claims have been filed by claimants who do not show any signs of asbestos related disease 
new asbestos cases are often filed in those jurisdictions with a reputation for judges and juries that are extremely sympathetic to plaintiffs 
approximately manufacturers and distributors of asbestos products have filed for bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos related liabilities 
a bankruptcy sometimes involves an agreement to a plan between the debtor and its creditors  including current and future asbestos claimants 
although the debtor is negotiating in part with its insurers money  insurers are generally given only limited opportunity to be heard 
in addition to contributing to the overall number of claims  bankruptcy proceedings have also caused increased settlement demands against remaining solvent defendants 
there have been some positive legislative and judicial developments in the asbestos environment over the past several years various challenges to the mass screening of claimants have been mounted which have led to higher medical evidentiary standards 
for example  several asbestos injury settlement trusts have suspended their acceptance of claims that were based on the diagnosis of specific physicians or screening companies 
further investigations of the medical screening process for asbestos claims are underway 
a number of states have implemented legislative and judicial reforms that focus the courts resources on the claims of the most seriously injured 
those who allege serious injury and can present credible evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts  while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket  which preserves the right to pursue litigation in the future 
a number of key jurisdictions have adopted venue reform that requires plaintiffs to have a connection to the jurisdiction in order to file a complaint 
in recognition that many aspects of bankruptcy plans are unfair to certain classes of claimants and to the insurance industry  these plans are being more closely scrutinized by the courts and rejected when appropriate 
our most significant individual asbestos exposures involve products liability on the part of traditional defendants who were engaged in the manufacture  distribution or installation of asbestos products 
we wrote excess liability and or general liability coverages for these insureds 
while these insureds are relatively few in number  their exposure has become substantial due to the increased volume of claims  the erosion of the underlying limits and the bankruptcies of target defendants 
our other asbestos exposures involve products and non products liability on the part of peripheral defendants  including a mix of manufacturers  distributors and installers of certain products that contain asbestos in small quantities and owners or operators of properties where asbestos was present 
generally  these insureds are named defendants on a regional rather than a nationwide basis 
as the financial resources of traditional asbestos defendants have been depleted  plaintiffs are targeting these viable peripheral parties with greater frequency and  in many cases  for large awards 
asbestos claims against the major manufacturers  distributors or installers of asbestos products were typically presented under the products liability section of primary general liability policies as well as under excess liability policies  both of which typically had aggregate limits that capped an insurer s exposure 
in recent years  a number of asbestos claims by insureds are being presented as non products claims  such as those by installers of asbestos products and by property owners or operators who allegedly had asbestos on their property  under the premises or operations section of primary general liability policies 
unlike products exposures  these non products exposures typically had no aggregate limits on coverage  creating potentially greater exposure 
further  in an effort to seek additional 
table of contents insurance coverage  some insureds with installation activities who have substantially eroded their products coverage are presenting new asbestos claims as non products operations claims or attempting to reclassify previously settled products claims as non products claims to restore a portion of previously exhausted products aggregate limits 
it is difficult to predict whether insureds will be successful in asserting claims under non products coverage or whether insurers will be successful in asserting additional defenses 
accordingly  the ultimate cost to insurers of the claims for coverage not subject to aggregate limits is uncertain 
in establishing our asbestos reserves  we evaluate the exposure presented by each insured 
as part of this evaluation  we consider a variety of factors including the available insurance coverage  limits and deductibles  the jurisdictions involved  past settlement values of similar claims  the potential role of other insurance  particularly underlying coverage below our excess liability policies  potential bankruptcy impact  relevant judicial interpretations  and applicable coverage defenses  including asbestos exclusions 
various us federal proposals to solve the ongoing asbestos litigation crisis have been considered by the us congress over the years  but none have yet been enacted 
the prospect of federal asbestos reform legislation remains uncertain 
as a result  we have assumed a continuation of the current legal environment with no benefit from any federal asbestos reform legislation 
our actuaries and claim personnel perform periodic analyses of our asbestos related exposures 
the analyses during  and noted no developments that would indicate the need to change our estimate of ultimate liabilities related to asbestos claims 
the following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending loss reserves related to asbestos claims 
years ended december in millions gross loss reserves  beginning of year reinsurance recoverable  beginning of year net loss reserves  beginning of year net incurred losses net losses paid net loss reserves  end of year reinsurance recoverable  end of year gross loss reserves  end of year the following table presents the number of policyholders for whom we have open asbestos case reserves and the related net loss reserves at december  as well as the net losses paid during by component 
number of net loss net losses policyholders reserves paid in millions traditional defendants peripheral defendants future claims from unknown policyholders 
table of contents significant uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability related to asbestos related claims 
this uncertainty is due to several factors including the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims  plaintiffs expanding theories of liability and increased focus on peripheral defendants  the volume of claims by unimpaired plaintiffs and the extent to which they can be precluded from making claims  the sizes of settlements related to more severely impaired plaintiffs  the efforts by insureds to claim the right to non products coverage not subject to aggregate limits  the number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos related liabilities  the ability of claimants to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure  the impact of the exhaustion of primary limits and the resulting increase in claims on excess liability policies we have issued  inconsistent court decisions and diverging legal interpretations  and the possibility  however remote  of federal legislation that would address the asbestos problem 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
toxic waste reserves 
toxic waste claims relate primarily to pollution and related cleanup costs 
our insureds have two potential areas of exposure hazardous waste dump sites and pollution at the insured site primarily from underground storage tanks and manufacturing processes 
the us federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of superfund has been interpreted to impose strict  retroactive and joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties prps for the cost of remediating hazardous waste sites 
most sites have multiple prps 
most prps named to date are parties who have been generators  transporters  past or present landowners or past or present site operators 
these prps had proper government authorization in many instances 
however  relative fault has not been a factor in establishing liability 
insurance policies issued to prps were not intended to cover claims arising from gradual pollution 
since  most policies have specifically excluded such exposures 
environmental remediation claims tendered by prps and others to insurers have frequently resulted in disputes over insurers contractual obligations with respect to pollution claims 
the resulting litigation against insurers extends to issues of liability  coverage and other policy provisions 
there is substantial uncertainty involved in estimating our liabilities related to these claims 
first  the liabilities of the claimants are extremely difficult to estimate 
at any given waste site  the allocation of remediation costs among governmental authorities and the prps varies greatly depending on a variety of factors 
second  different courts have addressed liability and coverage issues regarding pollution claims and have reached inconsistent conclusions in their interpretation of several issues 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved definitively in the near future 

table of contents uncertainties also remain as to the superfund law itself 
superfund s taxing authority expired on december  and has not been re enacted 
federal legislation appears to be at a standstill 
at this time  it is not possible to predict the direction that any reforms may take  when they may occur or the effect that any changes may have on the insurance industry 
without federal movement on superfund reform  the enforcement of superfund liability has occasionally shifted to the states 
states are being forced to reconsider state level cleanup statutes and regulations 
as individual states move forward  the potential for conflicting state regulation becomes greater 
in a few states  we have seen cases brought against insureds or directly against insurance companies for environmental pollution and natural resources damages 
to date  only a few natural resource claims have been filed and they are being vigorously defended 
significant uncertainty remains as to the cost of remediating the state sites 
because of the large number of state sites  such sites could prove even more costly in the aggregate than superfund sites 
in establishing our toxic waste reserves  we evaluate the exposure presented by each insured 
as part of this evaluation  we consider a variety of factors including the probable liability  available insurance coverage  past settlement values of similar claims  relevant judicial interpretations  applicable coverage defenses as well as facts that are unique to each insured 
in each of the past three years  the analysis of our toxic waste exposures indicated that some of our insureds had become responsible for the remediation of additional polluted sites and that  as clean up standards continue to evolve as a result of technology advances  the estimated cost of remediation of certain sites had increased 
based on these developments  we increased our net toxic waste loss reserves by million in  million in and million in the following table presents a reconciliation of our beginning and ending loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  related to toxic waste claims 
the reinsurance recoverable related to these claims is minimal 
years ended december in millions reserves  beginning of year incurred losses losses paid reserves  end of year at december   million of the net toxic waste loss reserves were ibnr reserves 
reinsurance recoverable 
reinsurance recoverable is the estimated amount recoverable from reinsurers related to the losses we have incurred 
at december   reinsurance recoverable included million recoverable with respect to paid losses and loss expenses  which is included in other assets  and billion recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses 
reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses represents an estimate of the portion of our gross loss reserves that will be recovered from reinsurers 
such reinsurance recoverable is estimated as part of our loss reserving process using assumptions that are consistent with the assumptions used in estimating the gross loss reserves 
consequently  the estimation of reinsurance recoverable is subject to similar judgments and uncertainties as the estimation of gross loss reserves 

table of contents ceded reinsurance contracts do not relieve us of our primary obligation to our policyholders 
consequently  an exposure exists with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities we believe it has assumed under the reinsurance contracts 
we are selective in regard to our reinsurers  placing reinsurance with only those reinsurers who we believe have strong balance sheets and superior underwriting ability  and we monitor the financial strength of our reinsurers on an ongoing basis 
nevertheless  in recent years  certain of our reinsurers have experienced financial difficulties or exited the reinsurance business 
in addition  we may become involved in coverage disputes with our reinsurers 
a provision for estimated uncollectible reinsurance is recorded based on periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers  the financial condition of the reinsurers  coverage disputes and other relevant factors 
prior year loss development changes in loss reserve estimates are unavoidable because such estimates are subject to the outcome of future events 
loss trends vary and time is required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed 
reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening 
reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development or reserve releases 
a reconciliation of our beginning and ending loss reserves  net of reinsurance  for the three years ended december  is as follows years ended december in millions net loss reserves  beginning of year net incurred losses and loss expenses related to current year prior years net payments for losses and loss expenses related to current year prior years foreign currency translation effect net loss reserves  end of year during  we experienced overall favorable prior year development of million  which represented of the net loss reserves as of december  this compares with favorable prior year development of million during  which represented of the net loss reserves at december   and favorable prior year development of million during  which represented of the net loss reserves at december  such favorable development was reflected in operating results in these respective years 

table of contents the following table presents the overall prior year loss development for the three years ended december  by accident year 
calendar year favorable unfavorable development accident year in millions and prior the net favorable development of million in was due to various factors 
the most significant factors were we experienced overall favorable development of about million in the professional liability classes other than fidelity  including about million outside the us the most significant amount of favorable development occurred in the directors and officers liability class  particularly outside the us  with additional favorable development in the fiduciary liability and employment practices liability classes  partially offset by adverse development in the errors and omissions liability class 
the aggregate reported loss activity related to accident years and prior was less than expected  reflecting a favorable business climate  lower policy limits and better terms and conditions 
as these years have become increasingly mature  and as the reported loss experience has emerged better than we expected  we have gradually decreased the expected loss ratios for these accident years 
this favorable development was recognized as one among many factors in the determination of loss reserves for more current accident years 
among other important factors were the uncertainty surrounding the recent crisis in the financial markets and its aftermath and the general downward trend in prices in recent years 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the aggregate in the personal and commercial liability classes 
favorable development in the more recent accident years  particularly in accident years to  more than offset adverse development in accident years and prior  which included million of incurred losses related to toxic waste claims 
the overall frequency and severity of prior period liability claims were lower than expected and the effects of underwriting changes that affected these years have been more positive than expected  especially in the commercial excess liability class 
these factors were reflected in the determination of the carried loss reserves for these classes at december  we experienced favorable development of about million in the aggregate in the personal and commercial property classes  primarily related to the and accident years 
the severity and frequency of late developing property claims that emerged during were lower than expected 
because the incidence of large property losses is subject to a considerable element of fortuity  reserve estimates for these claims are based on an analysis of past loss experience on average over a period of years 
as a result  the favorable development in was recognized  but this factor had a relatively modest effect on our determination of carried property loss reserves at december  
table of contents we experienced unfavorable development of about million in the fidelity class due to higher than expected reported loss emergence  mainly related to the accident year and primarily in the us loss reserve estimates at the end of included an expectation of less prior year loss activity than actually occurred in this activity was driven by case developments on a relatively small number of large claims related to the recent economic and financial environment 
as a result  this adverse development was reflected in but only had a modest effect on the determination of carried loss reserves at december  we experienced favorable development of about million in the personal automobile business due primarily to lower than expected frequency of prior year claims 
this factor was reflected in our determination of carried personal automobile loss reserves at december  we experienced favorable development of about million in the surety business due to lower than expected loss emergence in recent accident years 
loss reserve estimates at the end of in this class included an expectation of more late reported losses than actually occurred in however  since the experience in this class is volatile and we would still expect such losses to occur over time  the favorable development in was given only modest weight in our determination of carried surety loss reserves at december  we experienced favorable development of about million in the run off of our reinsurance assumed business due primarily to better than expected reported loss activity from cedants 
the net favorable development of million in was also due to various factors 
the most significant factors were we experienced favorable development of about million in the professional liability classes other than fidelity  including about million outside the us a significant amount of favorable development occurred in the directors and officers liability  fiduciary liability and employment practices liability classes 
we had a modest amount of unfavorable development in the errors and omissions liability class  particularly outside the us a majority of the favorable development in the professional liability classes was in accident years through reported loss activity related to these accident years was less than expected reflecting a favorable business climate  lower policy limits and better terms and conditions 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the aggregate in the homeowners and commercial property classes  primarily related to the and accident years 
the severity of late reported property claims that emerged during was lower than expected and development on prior year catastrophe events was favorable 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the aggregate in the commercial and personal liability classes 
favorable development in more recent accident years  particularly through  was partially offset by adverse development in accident years and prior  which included million of incurred losses related to toxic waste claims 
the frequency and severity of prior period excess and primary liability claims have been generally lower than expected and the effects of underwriting changes that affected these years appear to have been more positive than expected 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the run off of our reinsurance assumed business due primarily to better than expected reported loss activity from cedants 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the surety business due to lower than expected loss emergence  mainly related to more recent accident years 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the personal automobile business due primarily to lower than expected severity 

table of contents the net favorable development of million in was also due to various factors 
the most significant factors were we experienced favorable development of about million in the professional liability classes other than fidelity  including about million outside the us favorable development occurred in each of the primary professional liability classes  including directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability  fiduciary liability and employment practices liability 
a majority of this favorable development was in the and accident years 
reported loss activity related to these accident years was less than expected  reflecting a favorable business climate  lower policy limits and better terms and conditions 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the aggregate in the homeowners and commercial property classes  primarily related to the and accident years 
the severity of late reported property claims that emerged during was lower than expected 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the commercial liability classes 
favorable development  particularly in excess liability and multiple peril liability classes in accident years through  more than offset adverse development in accident years prior to  which was mostly due to million of incurred losses related to toxic waste claims 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the fidelity class due to lower than expected reported loss emergence  particularly outside the us  mainly related to recent accident years 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the run off of our reinsurance assumed business due primarily to better than expected reported loss activity from cedants 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the workers compensation class due in part to the positive effects of reforms in california 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the personal automobile business due primarily to lower than expected severity 
in item of this report  we present an analysis of our consolidated loss reserve development on a calendar year basis for each of the ten years prior to the variability in reserve development over the ten year period illustrates the uncertainty of the loss reserving process 
conditions and trends that have affected reserve development in the past will not necessarily recur in the future 
it is not appropriate to extrapolate future favorable or unfavorable reserve development based on amounts experienced in prior years 
our us property and casualty subsidiaries are required to file annual statements with insurance regulatory authorities prepared on an accounting basis prescribed or permitted by such authorities 
these annual statements include an analysis of loss reserves  referred to as schedule p  that presents accident year loss development information by line of business for the nine years prior to it is our intention to post the schedule p for our combined us property and casualty subsidiaries on our website as soon as it becomes available 
investment results property and casualty investment income before taxes increased by in compared with and decreased by in compared with the impact of growth in average invested assets on investment income in compared to was substantially offset by the impact of lower average yields on our investment portfolio 
the decrease in the average yield of our investment portfolio in primarily resulted from lower reinvestment yields on fixed maturity securities that matured  were redeemed by the issuer or were sold during the year 
investment income in benefited slightly from the impact of currency fluctuation on income from our non us investments 
lower yields  primarily on short term investments  contributed to the decrease in investment income in in addition  almost half of the decline in was related to currency fluctuation on income from our non us investments 
the growth in investment income in and was limited as average invested assets increased only modestly as a result of substantial dividend distributions made by the property and casualty subsidiaries to chubb during  and 
table of contents the effective tax rate on our investment income was in compared with in and in the effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of our holding a different proportion of our investment portfolio in tax exempt securities during different periods 
on an after tax basis  property and casualty investment income increased by in and decreased by in the after tax annualized yield on the investment portfolio that supports our property and casualty insurance business was in compared with in and in if investment yields and average foreign currency to us dollar exchange rates in are similar to year end levels  property and casualty investment income after taxes for is expected to decline modestly 
this expected decline is primarily as a result of the assumption that funds from maturing securities will be reinvested in securities with yields lower than the yields of the maturing securities 
other income and charges other income and charges  which includes miscellaneous income and expenses of the property and casualty subsidiaries  was not significant in the last three years 
corporate and other corporate and other comprises investment income earned on corporate invested assets  interest expense and other expenses not allocated to our operating subsidiaries and the results of our non insurance subsidiaries  including chubb financial solutions  which is in run off 
corporate and other produced a loss before taxes of million in compared with losses of million and million in and  respectively 
the lower loss in compared to was primarily due to higher investment income  which included a million special dividend received during on an equity security investment  partially offset by the impact of lower yields 
the higher loss in compared to was due to higher interest expense and lower investment income 
the higher interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding in as a result of the issuance of additional debt during the lower investment income in was primarily the result of a decrease in the average yield on short term investments 
the higher interest expense in compared with was not offset by an increase in investment income as the proceeds from the issuance of the debt were used to repurchase chubb s common stock 
chubb financial solutions chubb financial solutions cfs participated in derivative financial instruments and has been in run off since since that date  cfs has terminated early or run off nearly all of its contractual obligations within its financial products portfolio 
cfs s aggregate exposure  or retained risk  from each of its remaining in force financial products contracts is referred to as notional amount 
notional amounts are used to calculate the exchange of contractual cash flows and are not necessarily representative of the potential for gain or loss 
the notional amounts are not recorded on the balance sheet 
cfs s remaining financial products contracts at december  included a derivative contract linked to an equity market index that terminates in and a few other insignificant transactions 
we estimate that the notional amount under the remaining contracts was about million and the fair value of our future obligations was million at december  
table of contents realized investment gains and losses net realized investment gains and losses were as follows years ended december in millions net realized gains losses fixed maturities equity securities other invested assets harbor point other than temporary impairment losses fixed maturities equity securities realized investment gains losses before tax realized investment gains losses after tax decisions to sell equity securities and fixed maturities are governed principally by considerations of investment opportunities and tax consequences 
as a result  realized gains and losses on the sale of these investments may vary significantly from period to period 
however  such gains and losses generally have little  if any  impact on shareholders equity as all of these investments are carried at fair value  with the unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
a primary reason for the sale of fixed maturities in each of the last three years has been to improve our portfolio s after tax return without sacrificing quality where market opportunities have existed to do so 
the net realized gains and losses of other invested assets represent primarily the aggregate of distributions to us from the limited partnerships in which we have an interest and changes in our equity in the net assets of those partnerships based on valuations provided to us by the manager of each partnership 
due to the timing of our receipt of valuation data from the investment managers  these investments are generally reported on a one quarter lag 
the net realized gains of the limited partnerships reported in reflected the strong performance of the equity and high yield investment markets in the fourth quarter of and for the first nine months of in  we transferred our ongoing reinsurance business and certain related assets to a reinsurance company  harbor point limited 
in exchange  we received million of convertible notes and warrants to purchase common stock of harbor point 
the transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of million  of which million was recognized in in  the notes were converted into  shares of common stock of harbor point and we recognized the remaining million gain 
we regularly review those invested assets whose fair value is less than cost to determine if an other than temporary decline in value has occurred 
we have a monitoring process overseen by a committee of investment and accounting professionals that is responsible for identifying those securities to be specifically evaluated for a potential other than temporary impairment 
the determination of whether a decline in value of any investment is temporary or other than temporary requires the judgment of management 
the assessment of other than temporary impairment of fixed maturities and equity securities is based on both quantitative criteria and qualitative information and also considers a number of factors including  but not limited to  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments  general 
table of contents market conditions and industry or sector specific factors 
the decision to recognize a decline in the value of a security carried at fair value as other than temporary rather than temporary has no impact on shareholders equity 
in determining whether fixed maturities are other than temporarily impaired  prior to april   we considered many factors including the intent and ability to hold a security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of the security s cost 
when an impairment was deemed other than temporary  the security was written down to fair value and the entire writedown was included in net income as a realized investment loss 
effective april   the corporation adopted new guidance which modified the previous guidance on the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments of debt securities 
under the new guidance  we are required to recognize an other than temporary impairment loss for a fixed maturity when we conclude that we have the intent to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell an impaired fixed maturity before the security recovers to its amortized cost value or it is likely it will not recover the amortized cost value of an impaired security 
also under this guidance  if we have the intent to sell or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell an impaired fixed maturity before the security recovers to its amortized cost value  the security is written down to fair value and the entire amount of the writedown is included in net income as a realized investment loss 
for all other impaired fixed maturities  the impairment loss is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount representing the loss related to all other factors 
the amount of the impairment loss that represents the credit loss is included in net income as a realized investment loss and the amount of the impairment loss that relates to all other factors is included in other comprehensive income 
in determining whether equity securities are other than temporarily impaired  we consider our intent and ability to hold a security for a period of time sufficient to allow us to recover our cost 
if a decline in the fair value of an equity security is deemed to be other than temporary  the security is written down to fair value and the amount of the writedown is included in net income as a realized investment loss 
during each of the last three years  particularly during as a result of the significant financial market disruption  the fair value of some of our investments declined to a level below our cost 
some of these investments were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
the issuers of the equity securities deemed to be other than temporarily impaired in each of the last three years were not concentrated within any individual industry or sector 
about of the fixed maturities deemed to be other than temporarily impaired in were corporate securities within the financial services sector 
information related to investment securities in an unrealized loss position at december  and is included in note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital resources and liquidity capital resources and liquidity represent a company s overall financial strength and its ability to generate cash flows  borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs 
capital resources capital resources provide protection for policyholders  furnish the financial strength to support the business of underwriting insurance risks and facilitate continued business growth 
at december   the corporation had shareholders equity of billion and total debt of billion 
chubb has outstanding million of notes due in  million of notes due in  million of notes and million of debentures due in  million of debentures due in  million of notes due in and million of notes due in  all of which are unsecured 
chubb also has outstanding billion of unsecured junior subordinated capital securities that become due on april   the scheduled maturity date  but only to the extent that chubb has received sufficient net proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying capital securities 
chubb must use its 
table of contents commercially reasonable efforts  subject to certain market disruption events  to sell enough qualifying capital securities to permit repayment of the capital securities on the scheduled maturity date or as soon thereafter as possible 
any remaining outstanding principal amount will be due on march   the final maturity date 
the capital securities bear interest at a fixed rate of through april  thereafter  the capital securities will bear interest at a rate equal to the three month libor rate plus 
subject to certain conditions  chubb has the right to defer the payment of interest on the capital securities for a period not exceeding ten consecutive years 
during any such period  interest will continue to accrue and chubb generally may not declare or pay any dividends on or purchase any shares of its capital stock 
in connection with the issuance of the capital securities  chubb entered into a replacement capital covenant in which it agreed that it will not repay  redeem or purchase the capital securities before march   unless  subject to certain limitations  it has received proceeds from the sale of replacement capital securities  as defined 
subject to the replacement capital covenant  the capital securities may be redeemed  in whole or in part  at any time on or after april  at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus any accrued interest on or prior to april  at a redemption price equal to the greater of i the principal amount or ii a make whole amount  in each case plus any accrued interest 
management regularly monitors the corporation s capital resources 
in connection with our long term capital strategy  chubb from time to time contributes capital to its property and casualty subsidiaries 
in addition  in order to satisfy capital needs as a result of any rating agency capital adequacy or other future rating issues  or in the event we were to need additional capital to make strategic investments in light of market opportunities  we may take a variety of actions  which could include the issuance of additional debt and or equity securities 
we believe that our strong financial position and conservative debt level provide us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds externally through debt or equity financings on both a short term and long term basis 
in  and  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares   shares and  shares  respectively  of common stock 
in june  the board of directors authorized an increase of  shares of common stock to the authorization approved in as of december   no shares remained under these share repurchase authorizations 
in december  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  shares of common stock 
in  we repurchased  shares of chubb s common stock in open market transactions at a cost of  million 
in  we repurchased  shares of chubb s common stock in open market transactions at a cost of  million 
in  we repurchased  shares of chubb s common stock in open market transactions at a cost of  million 
as of december    shares remained under the december share repurchase authorization  which has no expiration date 
we expect to repurchase the shares remaining under the december authorization by the end of january  subject to market conditions 
ratings chubb and its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are rated by major rating agencies 
these ratings reflect the rating agency s opinion of our financial strength  operating performance  strategic position and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders 
credit ratings assess a company s ability to make timely payments of interest and principal on its debt 
financial strength ratings assess an insurer s ability to meet its financial obligations to policyholders 
ratings are an important factor in establishing our competitive position in the insurance markets 
there can be no assurance that our ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed 
it is possible that one or more of the rating agencies may raise or lower our existing ratings in the future 
if our credit ratings were downgraded  we might incur higher borrowing costs and might have 
table of contents more limited means to access capital 
a downgrade in our financial strength ratings could adversely affect the competitive position of our insurance operations  including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets 
liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of its business operations 
the corporation s liquidity requirements in the past have generally been met by funds from operations and we expect that in the future funds from operations will continue to be sufficient to meet such requirements 
liquidity requirements could also be met by funds received upon the maturity or sale of marketable securities in our investment portfolio 
the corporation also has the ability to borrow under its existing million credit facility and we believe we could issue debt or equity securities 
our property and casualty operations provide liquidity in that premiums are generally received months or even years before losses are paid under the policies purchased by such premiums 
historically  cash receipts from operations  consisting of insurance premiums and investment income  have provided more than sufficient funds to pay losses  operating expenses and dividends to chubb 
after satisfying our cash requirements  excess cash flows are used to build the investment portfolio and thereby increase future investment income 
our strong underwriting and investment results continued to generate substantial cash from operations in new cash available for investment by our property and casualty subsidiaries was approximately million in compared with billion in and million in new cash available for investment by our property and casualty subsidiaries in was lower than in as a result of a billion increase in dividends paid to chubb by the property and casualty subsidiaries and modestly higher loss payments partially offset by lower income tax payments 
new cash available for investment in was higher than in due to an million decrease in dividends paid by the property and casualty subsidiaries to chubb and lower loss payments  partially offset by lower premium collections and higher income tax payments 
our property and casualty subsidiaries maintain substantial investments in highly liquid  short term marketable securities 
accordingly  we do not anticipate selling long term fixed maturity investments to meet any liquidity needs 
chubb s liquidity requirements primarily include the payment of dividends to shareholders and interest and principal on debt obligations 
the declaration and payment of future dividends to chubb s shareholders will be at the discretion of chubb s board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including our operating results  financial condition  capital requirements and any regulatory constraints 
as a holding company  chubb s ability to continue to pay dividends to shareholders and to satisfy its debt obligations relies on the availability of liquid assets  which is dependent in large part on the dividend paying ability of its property and casualty subsidiaries 
the timing and amount of dividends paid by the property and casualty subsidiaries to chubb may vary from year to year 
our property and casualty subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate that restrict the amount of dividends they may pay without the prior approval of regulatory authorities 
the restrictions are generally based on net income and on certain levels of policyholders surplus as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
dividends in excess of such thresholds are considered extraordinary and require prior regulatory approval 
during  and  these subsidiaries paid dividends to chubb of billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
the billion of dividends paid by the subsidiaries to chubb during exceeded the maximum dividend distribution amount of approximately billion that the subsidiaries could have made during without prior approval 
regulatory approval was obtained for those dividend payments deemed to be extraordinary in the maximum dividend distribution that may be made by the property and casualty subsidiaries to chubb during without prior regulatory approval is approximately billion 

table of contents chubb has a revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that provides for up to million of unsecured borrowings 
there have been no borrowings under this agreement 
various interest rate options are available to chubb  all of which are based on market interest rates 
the agreement contains customary restrictive covenants including a covenant to maintain a minimum consolidated shareholders equity  as adjusted 
at december   chubb was in compliance with all such covenants 
the revolving credit facility is available for general corporate purposes and to support our commercial paper borrowing arrangement 
the agreement has a termination date of october  under the agreement chubb is permitted to request on two occasions  at any time during the remaining term of the agreement  an extension of the maturity date for an additional one year period 
on the termination date of the agreement  any borrowings then outstanding become payable 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table provides our future payments due by period under contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type of obligation 
and and there after total in millions principal due under long term debt interest payments on long term debt a future minimum rental payments under operating leases loss and loss expense reserves b total a junior subordinated capital securities of billion bear interest at a fixed rate of through april  and at a rate equal to the three month libor rate plus thereafter 
for purposes of the above table  interest after april  was calculated using the three month libor rate as of december  the table includes future interest payments through the scheduled maturity date  april  interest payments for the period from the scheduled maturity date through the final maturity date  march   would increase the contractual obligation by million 
it is our expectation that the capital securities will be redeemed at the end of the fixed interest rate period 
b there is typically no stated contractual commitment associated with property and casualty insurance loss reserves 
the obligation to pay a claim arises only when a covered loss event occurs and a settlement is reached 
the vast majority of our loss reserves relate to claims for which settlements have not yet been reached 
our loss reserves therefore represent estimates of future payments 
these estimates are dependent on the outcome of claim settlements that will occur over many years 
accordingly  the payment of the loss reserves is not fixed as to either amount or timing 
the estimate of the timing of future payments is based on our historical loss payment patterns 
the ultimate amount and timing of loss payments will likely differ from our estimate and the differences could be material 
we expect that these loss payments will be funded  in large part  by future cash receipts from operations 
the above table excludes certain commitments totaling million at december  to fund limited partnership investments 
these commitments can be called by the partnerships generally over a period of five years or less  if and when needed by the partnerships to fund certain partnership expenses or the purchase of investments 
it is uncertain whether and  if so  when we will be required to fund these commitments 
there is no predetermined payment schedule 

table of contents the corporation does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the corporation s financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources  other than as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
invested assets the main objectives in managing our investment portfolios are to maximize after tax investment income and total investment return while minimizing credit risk and managing interest rate risk in order to ensure that funds will be available to meet our insurance obligations 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including underwriting results and our resulting tax position  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals based on guidelines established by management and approved by the boards of directors of chubb and its respective operating companies 
our investment portfolio primarily comprises high quality bonds  principally tax exempt securities  corporate issues  mortgage backed securities and us treasury securities  as well as foreign government and corporate bonds that support our operations outside the united states 
the portfolio also includes equity securities  primarily publicly traded common stocks  and other invested assets  primarily private equity limited partnerships  all of which are held with the primary objective of capital appreciation 
limited partnership investments by their nature are less liquid and may involve more risk than other investments 
we actively manage our risk through type of asset class and domestic and international diversification 
at december   we had investments in about separate partnerships 
we review the performance of these investments on a quarterly basis and we obtain audited financial statements annually 
in our us operations  during  we invested new cash primarily in tax exempt fixed maturities and we reduced our holdings of mortgage backed securities 
in and  we invested new cash in tax exempt fixed maturities and taxable fixed maturities 
the taxable fixed maturities we invested in were corporate bonds while we reduced our holdings of mortgage backed securities 
our objective is to achieve the appropriate mix of taxable and tax exempt securities in our portfolio to balance both investment and tax strategies 
at december  and december   of our us fixed maturity portfolio was invested in tax exempt securities compared with at december  we classify our fixed maturity securities  which may be sold prior to maturity to support our investment strategies  such as in response to changes in interest rates and the yield curve or to maximize after tax returns  as available for sale 
fixed maturities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value 
changes in the general interest rate environment affect the returns available on new fixed maturity investments 
while a rising interest rate environment enhances the returns available on new investments  it reduces the fair value of existing fixed maturity investments and thus the availability of gains on disposition 
a decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on new investments but increases the fair value of existing investments  creating the opportunity for realized investment gains on disposition 
the net unrealized appreciation before tax of our fixed maturities and equity securities carried at fair value was  million at december  and  million at december  compared with net unrealized depreciation of million at december  such unrealized appreciation and depreciation is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income taxes 
credit spreads  which refer to the difference between a risk free yield the yield on us treasury securities and the actual yields on all other fixed maturity investments  decreased significantly for almost all fixed maturity investments during due to improvements in the financial markets 
this resulted in an increase in the fair value of many of our fixed maturity investments 
the fair value of our equity investments increased in due to the improvements in the financial markets 
during  credit spreads increased significantly due to declines in the financial markets 
this resulted in the decrease in the fair value of many of our fixed maturity investments 
the fair value of our equity securities also decreased in due to the weakness in the financial markets 

table of contents fair values of financial instruments fair values of financial instruments are determined using valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
fair values are generally measured using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities or other inputs  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities that are observable  either directly or indirectly 
in those instances where observable inputs are not available  fair values are measured using unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
fair value estimates derived from unobservable inputs are affected by the assumptions used  including the discount rates and the estimated amounts and timing of future cash flows 
the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized in a current market exchange 
the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as follows level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 
level other inputs that are observable for the asset  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs that are unobservable 
the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments are as follows fair values for fixed maturities are determined by management  utilizing prices obtained from an independent  nationally recognized pricing service or  in the case of securities for which prices are not provided by a pricing service  from independent brokers 
for fixed maturities that have quoted prices in active markets  market quotations are provided 
for fixed maturities that do not trade on a daily basis  the pricing service and brokers provide fair value estimates using a variety of inputs including  but not limited to  benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  bids  offers  reference data  prepayment spreads and measures of volatility 
management reviews on an ongoing basis the reasonableness of the methodologies used by the relevant pricing service and brokers 
in addition  management  using the prices received for the securities from the pricing service and brokers  determines the aggregate portfolio price performance and reviews it against applicable indices 
if management believes that significant discrepancies exist  it will discuss these with the relevant pricing service or broker to resolve the discrepancies 
fair values of equity securities are based on quoted market prices 
the carrying value of short term investments approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these investments 
fair values of long term debt issued by chubb are determined by management  utilizing prices obtained from an independent  nationally recognized pricing service 
we use a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately of our fixed maturities 
the prices we obtain from a pricing service and brokers generally are non binding  but are reflective of current market transactions in the applicable financial instruments 
at december  and december   we did not hold financial instruments in our investment portfolio for which a lack of market liquidity impacted our determination of fair value 
the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the corporation s pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets  other than assets invested in pooled funds  are similar to the methods and assumptions used for our other financial instruments 
the fair value of pooled funds is based on the net asset value of the funds 
at december  and december   approximately of the pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets are categorized as level or level in the fair value hierarchy 

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits in  as a result of continued improvement in the financial markets  the fair value of the assets in our pension and other postretirement benefit plans increased 
postretirement benefit costs not recognized in net income decreased by million  which was reflected in other comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income taxes 
this decline reflected the periodic amortization of net actuarial loss and prior service cost and an increase in the fair value of the assets held by our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in excess of the expected return substantially offset by actuarial losses primarily from a decrease in the discount rates used to value our pension benefit obligations 
as a result of the improvement in the financial markets in  the fair value of the assets in our pension and other postretirement benefit plans increased  improving the funded status of these plans 
postretirement benefit costs not recognized in net income decreased by million  which was reflected in other comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income taxes 
during  the fair value of the assets in our pension and other postretirement benefit plans decreased significantly as a result of the turmoil in the financial markets 
due primarily to this decline  postretirement benefit costs not yet recognized in net income increased by million  which was reflected in other comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income taxes 
employee benefits are discussed further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in october  the financial accounting standards board issued new guidance related to the accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts 
the guidance identifies which costs relating to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts should be capitalized 
this guidance is effective for the corporation for the year beginning january  and may be applied prospectively or retrospectively 
we are in the process of assessing the effect that the implementation of the new guidance will have on the corporation s financial position and results of operations 
the amount of acquisition costs we will defer under the new guidance will be less than the amount deferred under our current accounting practice 
if prospective application is elected  net income in the year of adoption would be reduced as the amount of acquisition costs eligible for deferral would be lower 
amortization of the balance of deferred policy acquisition costs as of the date of adoption would continue over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
if retrospective application is elected  deferred policy acquisition costs and related deferred taxes would be reduced as of the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements with a corresponding reduction to shareholders equity 
subsequent events in january  significant storms and related flooding occurred in and around the city of brisbane  australia 
in february  storms and flooding occurred in the area of melbourne  australia  and severe winter storms occurred in the eastern and midwestern parts of the united states 
based on information currently available  we estimate the aggregate losses from these catastrophes are about million to million before tax  including our previously announced estimated losses of million to million before tax for the brisbane  australia storms and related flooding losses in january 
as more information becomes available about these events or if additional claims are reported  our estimate may be increased or decreased 
on february   an earthquake took place in new zealand but given its recent occurrence and the limited information available  we cannot estimate at this time the amount of any possible losses from this event 
the impact of these catastrophes will be reflected in our first quarter results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our primary exposure to market risks relates to our investment portfolio  which is sensitive to changes in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  credit quality  prepayment  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
we also have exposure to market risks through our debt obligations 
analytical tools and monitoring systems are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk 

table of contents investment portfolio interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a security that promises a fixed return to changes in interest rates 
when market interest rates rise  the fair value of our fixed income securities decreases 
we view the potential changes in price of our fixed income investments within the overall context of asset and liability management 
our actuaries estimate the payout pattern of our liabilities  primarily our property and casualty loss reserves  to determine their duration 
expressed in years  duration is the weighted average payment period of cash flows  where the weighting is based on the present value of the cash flows 
we set duration targets for our fixed income investment portfolios after consideration of the estimated duration of these liabilities and other factors  which allows us to prudently manage the overall effect of interest rate risk for the corporation 
the following table provides information about our fixed maturity investments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at december  and consideration is given to the call dates of securities trading above par value and the expected prepayment patterns of mortgage backed securities 
actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts  primarily due to future changes in interest rates

table of contents our tax exempt fixed maturity portfolio has an average expected maturity of five years 
our taxable fixed maturity portfolio has an average expected maturity of four years 
credit risk is the potential loss resulting from adverse changes in the issuer s ability to repay the debt obligation 
we have consistently invested in high quality marketable securities 
only about of our fixed maturity portfolio is below investment grade 
our investment portfolio does not have any direct exposure to either sub prime mortgages or collateralized debt obligations 
about of our tax exempt securities are rated aa or better by moody s with about rated aaa 
the average rating of our tax exempt securities is aa 
while about of our tax exempt securities are insured  the effect of insurance on the average credit rating of these securities is insignificant 
the insured tax exempt securities in our portfolio have been selected based on the quality of the underlying credit and not the value of the credit insurance enhancement 
about of the taxable bonds other than mortgage backed securities in our portfolio are issued by the us treasury or us government agencies or by foreign governments or are rated aa or better 
at year end  of our taxable fixed maturity portfolio was invested in mortgage backed securities 
about of the mortgage backed securities are rated aaa  and of the remaining  most are below investment grade 
of the aaa rated securities  are residential mortgage backed securities  consisting of government agency pass through securities guaranteed by a government agency or a government sponsored enterprise gse  gse collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and other cmos  all backed by single family home mortgages 
the majority of the cmos are actively traded in liquid markets 
the other of the aaa rated securities are call protected  commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs 
about of our cmbs are senior securities with the highest level of subordination 
the remainder of our cmbs are seasoned securities that were issued in or earlier 
prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns related to decreases and increases in interest rates that can either shorten or lengthen the expected timing of the principal repayments and thus the average life of a security  potentially reducing or increasing its effective yield 
such risk exists primarily within our portfolio of residential mortgage backed securities 
we monitor such risk regularly 
foreign currency risk is the sensitivity to foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the fair value and investment income related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments 
the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the currency of the local operating environment since business is primarily transacted in such local currency 
we seek to mitigate the risks relating to currency fluctuations by generally maintaining investments in those foreign currencies in which our property and casualty subsidiaries have loss reserves and other liabilities  thereby limiting exchange rate risk to the net assets denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   the property and casualty subsidiaries held foreign currency denominated investments of billion supporting our international operations 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange rate risk for the property and casualty subsidiaries are the canadian dollar  the british pound sterling  the euro and the australian dollar 
the following table provides information about those fixed maturity investments that are denominated in these currencies 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts in us dollar equivalents by expected maturity dates at december  actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
at december  total there amortized fair after cost value in millions canadian dollar british pound sterling euro australian dollar 
table of contents equity price risk is the potential loss in fair value of our equity securities resulting from adverse changes in stock prices 
in general  equities have more year to year price variability than intermediate term high grade bonds 
however  returns over longer time frames have generally been higher 
our publicly traded equity securities are high quality  diversified across industries and readily marketable 
a hypothetical decrease of in the market price of each of the equity securities held at december  and would have resulted in a decrease of million and million  respectively  in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio 
all of the above risks are monitored on an ongoing basis 
a combination of in house systems and proprietary models and externally licensed software are used to analyze individual securities as well as each portfolio 
these tools provide the portfolio managers with information to assist them in the evaluation of the market risks of the portfolio 
debt we also have interest rate risk on our debt obligations 
the following table presents expected cash flow of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by maturity date of our long term debt obligations at december  at december  there fair after total value in millions expected cash flows of principal amounts average interest rate
