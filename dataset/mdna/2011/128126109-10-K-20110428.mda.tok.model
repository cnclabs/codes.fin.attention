overview calamp corp 
calamp or the company develops and markets wireless communications solutions that deliver data  voice and video for critical networked communications and other applications 
the company two business segments are wireless datacom  which serves utility  governmental and enterprise customers  and satellite  which focuses on the north american direct broadcast satellite market 
wireless datacom the wireless datacom segment provides wireless communications technologies  products and services to the wireless networks and mobile resource management markets for a wide range of applications 
calamp has expertise in designing and providing applications involving various combinations of private and public cellular infrastructure networks  narrow band and broad band frequencies  licensed and unlicensed radio spectrum  and mobile and fixed remote communications 
the company wireless datacom segment is comprised of a wireless networks business and a mobile resource management business 
satellite the company dbs reception products have historically been sold to the two us dbs system operators  echostar and directv  for incorporation into complete subscription satellite television systems 
revenue of the company s satellite segment amounted to million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in fiscal years and  the company did not make any sales to directv because of pricing and competitive pressures 
in light of these factors  at the present time it is uncertain when  or if  the company will resume product shipments to directv 
critical accounting policies the company discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas where significant judgments are made include  but are not limited to the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  product warranties  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  and the valuation of long lived assets 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes an allowance for estimated bad debts based upon a review and evaluation of specific customer accounts identified as known and expected collection problems  based on historical experience  or due to insolvency or other collection issues 
as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company customer base is concentrated  with one customer accounting for almost one third of the company fiscal sales 
changes in either a key customer financial position  or the economy as a whole  could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the recorded allowance amount 
inventories the company evaluates the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if the carrying value is recoverable at estimated selling prices 
to the extent that estimated selling prices do not exceed the associated carrying values  inventory carrying amounts are written down 
in addition  the company generally treats inventory on hand or committed with suppliers  that is not expected to be sold within the next months  as excess and thus appropriate write downs of the inventory carrying amounts are established through a charge to cost of revenues 
estimated usage in the next months is based on firm demand represented by orders in backlog at the end of the quarter and management estimate of sales beyond existing backlog  giving consideration to customers forecasted demand  ordering patterns and product life cycles 
significant reductions in product pricing  or changes in technology and or demand may necessitate additional write downs of inventory carrying value in the future 
product warranties the company initially provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while it engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  the company warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from management estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
deferred income tax and uncertain tax positions deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes 
a deferred income tax asset is recognized if realization of such asset is more likely than not  based upon the weight of available evidence that includes historical operating performance and the company forecast of future operating performance 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred income tax assets and a valuation allowance is provided  as necessary 
during this evaluation  the company reviews its forecasts of income in conjunction with the positive and negative evidence surrounding the realizability of its deferred income tax assets to determine if a valuation allowance is needed 
in  the company adopted an accounting pronouncement related to financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc topic  income taxes formerly fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin which established a framework for determining the appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions 
fasb asc topic uses a two step approach in which a tax benefit is recognized if a position is more likely than not to be sustained 
the amount of the benefit is then measured as the highest tax benefit that is greater than likely to be realized upon settlement 
at february   the company had unrecognized tax benefits of  at february   the company had a net deferred income tax asset balance of million 
the current portion of this deferred tax asset is million and the noncurrent portion is million 
the net deferred income tax asset balance is comprised of a gross deferred tax asset of million and a valuation allowance of million 
impairment assessments of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets at february   the company had million in other intangible assets on its consolidated balance sheet 
the company believes the estimate of its valuation of long lived assets is a critical accounting estimate because if circumstances arose that led to a decrease in the valuation it could have a material impact on the company results of operations 
the company makes judgments about the recoverability of non goodwill intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on the balance sheet may exist 
in order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  the company typically makes various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to  considers market factors specific to that business and estimates future cash flows to be generated by that business 
these assumptions and estimates are necessarily subjective and based on management best estimates based on the information available at the time such estimates are made 
based on these assumptions and estimates  the company determines whether it needs to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on the balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value determined by a discounted cash flow analysis 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in the company business strategy and its internal forecasts 
although management believes the assumptions and estimates that have been made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the company reported financial results 
more conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges in the statement of operations  and lower asset values on the balance sheet 
conversely  less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges 
stock based compensation expense the company measures stock based compensation expense at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and recognizes the expense over the employee requisite service vesting period using the straight line method 
the measurement of stock based compensation expense is based on several criteria including  but not limited to  the valuation model used and associated input factors  such as expected term of the award  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and forfeiture rate 
certain of these inputs are subjective to some degree and are determined based in part on management judgment 
the company recognizes the compensation expense on a straight line basis for its graded vesting awards 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
however  the cumulative compensation expense recognized at any point in time must at least equal the portion of the grant date fair value of the award that is vested at that date 
as used in this context  the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations  and refers only to the unvested portion of the surrendered equity awards 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured 
in cases where terms of sale include subjective customer acceptance criteria  revenue is deferred until the acceptance criteria are met 
critical judgments made by management related to revenue recognition include the determination of whether or not customer acceptance criteria are perfunctory or inconsequential 
the determination of whether or not the customer acceptance terms are perfunctory or inconsequential impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized 
critical judgments also include estimates of warranty reserves  which are established based on historical experience and knowledge of the product 
the company defers revenues from products sold with data communication services because the services are essential to the functionality of the products  and accordingly  the associated product costs are recorded as deferred costs 
these deferred amounts are recognized over the minimum contractual term of one year on a straight line basis 
revenues from renewals of the services after the initial one year term are recognized when services are performed 
in certain instances where customers prepay the renewals  such amounts are recorded as deferred revenues and are recognized over future periods in accordance with the renewal term 
the company also undertakes projects that include the design  development and manufacture of communication systems used in the public safety and transportation sectors that are specially customized to customers specifications or that involve fixed site construction 
sales under such contracts are recorded under the percentage of completion method 
estimated revenues and costs are recorded as work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs utilizing the most recent estimates of costs 
if the current contract estimate indicates a loss  provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
critical estimates made by management related to revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method include the estimation of costs at completion and the determination of the overall margin rate on the specific project 
results of operations  fiscal years through the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenues represented by items included in the company consolidated statements of operations year ended february  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling general and administrative intangible asset amortization impairment loss operating loss other expense  net loss before income taxes income tax benefit provision net loss the company revenue  gross profit and operating income loss by business segment for the last three years are as follows revenue by segment year ended february  of of of s total s total s total segment satellite    wireless datacom   total   gross profit by segment year ended february  of of of s total s total s total segment satellite    wireless datacom    total   operating income loss by segment year ended february  of of of total total total s revenue s revenue s revenue segment satellite   wireless datacom    corporate expenses   total   satellite gross profit of million and operating income of million in fiscal includes a million gain recorded as a reduction of cost of revenues from a legal settlement with a supplier in january the operating income of million for that period also includes a goodwill impairment charge of million

corporate expenses in fiscal include an impairment charge of million on an investment in preferred stock of a privately held company 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue satellite revenue declined by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal because of reduced demand for the older generation dbs products that the company is still producing 
the company recently received product approval from echostar of a next generation product  and has three other products in development for this customer 
on the basis of these new products  the company expects that its satellite revenues will improve in fiscal wireless datacom revenue increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the revenue increase was predominantly related to the mrm product line and was attributable to the addition of new customers and growth in orders from existing customers 
gross profit and gross margins satellite gross profit was million in fiscal compared to million in the previous year 
the decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue 
satellite gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decline in gross margin was primarily due to lower absorption of fixed costs on lower revenue  partially offset by the benefits in fiscal from i  associated with the sale of satellite products for which the inventory cost had been written off in a prior year  a partial reversal of a vendor commitment liability due to consumption of materials of  and iii royalty income of  that had no corresponding cost of revenue 
wireless datacom gross profit increased by million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal wireless datacom gross margin improved to in fiscal from in fiscal due primarily to increased absorption of fixed manufacturing costs on higher revenue

operating expenses consolidated research and development r d expense increased by to million in fiscal from million in the previous year 
r d spending as a percent of revenues remained flat at

consolidated general and administrative g a expense declined by million to million in fiscal legal expense was  lower in fiscal than in fiscal due in part to the company s receipt of  from another company for the reimbursement of legal defense costs incurred in prior years related to a patent infringement claim 
also contributing to the decrease in g a expense were lower payroll costs due to workforce reductions and other cost cutting actions implemented by the company 
amortization of intangibles decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the reduction is attributable to some intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the current fiscal year 
non operating expense non operating expense was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the decrease was due to the presence in fiscal of a million loss on the sale of an investment in the preferred stock of a privately held company and a  foreign currency loss  partially offset by a year over year increase in net interest expense of  the higher interest expense in fiscal was attributable to the higher effective interest rate on the company s borrowings due to the minimum interest on the bank revolving credit facility and the interest on the subordinated notes in the principal amount of million  as well as interest expense from amortization of debt issue costs and debt discount as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
income tax benefit the tax benefit of  in fiscal was related to the carryback of net operating losses of the company s french subsidiary 
the tax benefit of million in fiscal was related to the reversal of an uncertain tax position which was resolved 
this uncertain tax position reversal was recorded as an income tax benefit because the benefit had been recognized in the applicable income tax returns but had not previously been recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
no other tax benefit was recorded in fiscal and because future realizability of such tax benefits is not considered to be more likely than not 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue satellite revenue increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company historically largest dbs customer put on hold all orders with the company in late may  including orders for newer generation products  pending a requalification of all products manufactured by calamp for this customer 
in january  the customer requalified calamp designs for the affected products and in late may the company resumed product shipments to this customer 
revenues from this dbs customer were million higher for fiscal compared to the previous year 
however  there were no sales to the company other us dbs service provider in fiscal compared to sales of million in the previous year due to pricing and competitive pressures on older generation products and the time required to get the next generation products qualified with this customer 
wireless datacom revenue declined by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in revenue is due to lower sales by the wireless datacom business units as the result of the global economic downturn 
gross profit and gross margins satellite gross profit was million in fiscal compared to million in the previous year 
the gross profit in fiscal was benefited by i a million gain from a legal settlement with a supplier that was recorded as a reduction of cost of revenues  ii million associated with the sale of satellite products for which the inventory cost had been fully reserved in the prior fiscal year  and iii a reduction of million in estimated costs to correct a product performance issue 
the increase in gross profit in fiscal compared to the previous year after excluding the aforementioned benefits was due primarily to higher satellite revenue 
wireless datacom gross profit decreased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal wireless datacom gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  due primarily to the decline in revenue and partly to the million patent sale in fiscal for which there was no associated cost 
excluding the patent sale  wireless datacom gross margin was in fiscal see also note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional operating data by business segment 
operating expenses consolidated r d expense decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to personnel reductions in the wireless networks business unit of the wireless datacom segment

consolidated g a decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to cost reduction actions implemented by the company 
other factors contributing to the decrease were i a  decrease in legal expense in fiscal compared to fiscal  and ii a  charge for severance costs of the company former satellite division president in fiscal partially offsetting the effect of these year over year expense reductions in g a was an increase of  in stock based compensation expense because the g a in fiscal included a reduction of stock compensation expense as the result of the forfeiture of unvested stock options upon the resignation of the company former president and chief executive officer in march amortization of intangibles decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal these reductions are attributable to the lower carrying value of intangible assets as a result of the impairment write down recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal non operating expense non operating expense was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase was due to the loss on the sale of an investment in the preferred stock of a privately held company of million in fiscal and a  foreign currency loss also in fiscal  compared to a foreign currency gain of  gain in fiscal these losses were partially offset by a decrease in net interest expense of  as a result of lower average outstanding bank debt during fiscal income tax benefit provision the income tax benefit of million in fiscal was related to the reversal of an uncertain tax position which was resolved 
this uncertain tax position reversal was recorded as an income tax benefit because the benefit had been recognized in the applicable income tax returns but had not previously been recognized in the consolidated statement of operations
