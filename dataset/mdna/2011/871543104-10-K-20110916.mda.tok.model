item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report on form k 
overview symmetricom  a worldwide leader in precision time and frequency technologies  sets the world s standard for time 
we generate  distribute and apply precise time for the communications  aerospace defense  it infrastructure and metrology industries 
symmetricom s customers  from communications service providers and network equipment manufacturers to governments and their suppliers worldwide  are able to build more reliable networks and systems by using our advanced timing technologies  atomic clocks  services and solutions 
our products support today s precise timing standards  including gps based timing  ieee ptp  network time protocol ntp  synchronous ethernet  building integrated timing supply bits and data over cable service interface specifications docsis r timing 
our fiscal year is the or weeks ending on the sunday closest to june fiscal years and were week fiscal years  and was a week fiscal year 
fiscal year summary during fiscal  we made considerable progress on our strategic growth initiatives  including capitalizing on the migration to next generation networks  expanding into new markets  and driving international market share 
in connection with our initiatives focused on building a more efficient organization  we transitioned our puerto rico manufacturing operations to sanmina sci to improve our supply chain and cost model 
the manufacturing transition adversely impacted our financial results in fiscal due to product fulfillment delays  however  it has given us a platform upon which to improve processes and build higher standards of operational performance and ultimately a more competitive organization 
with the transition complete and a return to normal levels of product availability and lead times  we are focused on leveraging our new manufacturing model for efficiency  quality  and customer service improvements 
we will continue to invest in and execute on growth initiatives that represent the most promising market opportunities in network and system timing  as we did with packetime  a successfully executed key technology initiative 
we intend to focus on applying that same core timing expertise and dedicated energy to our newest initiatives with csac  embedded soft clocks  and applications for the high frequency trading and the power utility markets 
known trends and uncertainties impacting future results of operations global market and economic conditions current macro economic factors are dynamic and uncertain and are likely to remain so in fiscal year if difficult economic conditions resume or markedly worsen or if there are reductions in government defense spending  our customers may delay or reduce capital expenditures 
among other things  these factors could result in reductions in sales of our products  longer sales cycles  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  additional excess and obsolete inventory  gross margin deterioration  slower adoption of new technologies  increased price competition and supplier difficulties 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the 
table of contents reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical accounting policies due to their subjective nature and judgments involved in each revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
our standard arrangement for our domestic and international customers includes a signed purchase order or contract and no right of return of delivered products 
revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities 
we assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral from our customers 
however  for many of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the product is shipped 
if we determine that collection of the invoice is not reasonably assured  we recognize revenue at the time that collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
generally  product revenue is generated from the sale of synchronization and timing equipment with embedded software that is incidental to product functionality 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed  provided collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for returns or credits under certain circumstances 
accordingly  we record an estimate of returns from distributors based on a historical average of distributor returns 
we record commission expense both when orders are received and shipped  at which times the commission is both earned and payable 
our multiple element product offerings generally include hardware  software and post contract support pcs services  which are considered separate units of accounting 
for multiple element arrangements entered into prior to the first quarter of fiscal  we recognized revenue based on the then relevant revenue recognition guidance that allowed us to utilize the residual method to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized on the delivered elements of the arrangement provided vendor specific objective evidence vsoe existed for the undelivered elements 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements was deferred  such as post contract support  and the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration was recognized as revenue 
vsoe of fair value is limited to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
vsoe of fair value is established for post contractual support based on the volume and pricing of the stand alone sales within a narrow range 
the fair value of the post contractual support is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related support period 
we adopted new revenue accounting guidance at the beginning of fiscal  on a prospective basis  for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after june  the adoption of this new authoritative guidance had no material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the periods presented 
in evaluating the revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements under the new accounting guidance  the total arrangement fees are allocated to all the deliverables based on their respective relative selling prices and the residual method is no longer permitted 
the relative selling price is determined using vsoe when available 
when vsoe cannot be established  we attempt to establish the selling price of deliverables based on relevant third party evidence tpe 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
generally  our go to market strategy differs from that of our competitors  and offerings may contain a significant level of proprietary technology  customization or differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand alone basis 
therefore  we typically are not able to determine tpe 
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use a best estimate selling price besp for the allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which 
table of contents we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold on a stand alone basis 
besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings 
we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to the price list established by our management which is typically based on general pricing practices  market conditions  geographies and targeted gross margin of products and services sold  and analysis of pricing history of new arrangements  including multiple element and stand alone transactions 
revenue from contracts that require development and manufacture in accordance with customer specifications and have a lengthy development period may be categorized into two types firm fixed price and cost plus reimbursement 
revenue is recognized under the fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method cost to cost basis  principally based upon the costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs at completion on the individual contracts 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
revenue recognized under cost plus contracts is recognized on the basis of direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of costs or as a performance based award fee 
revenue from long term contracts is reviewed periodically  with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts on a periodic basis 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value less costs to sell  provided its cost is higher 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand and technological obsolescence 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold 
warranty our standard warranty agreement is one year from shipment 
however  our warranty agreements are contract and component specific and can range to twenty years for selected components 
we offer extended warranty contracts on products that are less than eight years old 
the extended warranty contract is applicable for a maximum of nine years after the expiration of the standard one year warranty 
the revenue from extended warranty contracts is recognized ratably over the period of contract 
we accrue for anticipated warranty costs upon shipment 
our warranty reserve is based on the number of installed units  historical analysis of the volume of product returned to us under the warranty program  management s judgment regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims and associated repair costs 
we use the historical data to forecast our anticipated future warranty obligations 
this analysis is updated on a quarterly basis 
accounting for income taxes we provide for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period that includes the enactment date 

table of contents the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  which are made up of tax deductions  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits  assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully realize these assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we do not generate sufficient future income  the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  resulting in an additional income tax expense 
a portion of our tax credits are related to stock options and have a valuation allowance because of uncertainty regarding their realization 
if these tax credits are realized  the benefit will be credited to common stock 
in fiscal  we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under this guidance  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
short term investments short term investments consist of government securities  mutual funds and corporate debt securities that mature between three and months 
all of our short term investments  except the deferred compensation plan assets  are classified as available for sale 
during fiscal  we reclassified the deferred compensation plan assets from available for sale to trading securities in order to maintain consistency with the method in which we account for the deferred compensation obligation 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value with temporary unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as a component of stockholders equity 
unrealized gains and losses related to trading securities are included in interest income in our consolidated statements of operations 
short term investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
we consult with our investment manager and consider available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments on a quarterly basis 
other than temporary impairment charges exist when the entity has the intent to sell the security or it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded to operations and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
during fiscal year  we recorded losses related to short term investments of million 
no losses related to short term investments were recorded in fiscal and valuation of long lived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
intangible assets primarily include purchased technology and trademarks 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if these criteria indicate that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this evaluation indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
if an impairment charge were recognized  the amortization related to intangible assets would decrease during the remainder of the life of the asset 
in the third quarter of fiscal  because of the identification of goodwill impairment indicators  we first reviewed our other intangible and long lived assets for impairment and determined there was no impairment

the tax rate and provision are not readily comparable because the prior year goodwill impairment generated a large non deductible loss before income taxes  while in fiscal  we reported million as earnings before income taxes 
fiscal income taxes benefited favorably from various tax credits 
year ended change change june  june  income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax in thousands percentage of revenue discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of our qoe business 
the million increase in income from discontinued operations in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly attributable to the gain on sale of discontinued operations of million  net of income taxes 
key operating metrics key operating metrics for measuring our performance include sales backlog and contract revenue 
these metrics  which compare fiscal year with fiscal year  are discussed below 
sales backlog our backlog consists of firm orders that have yet to be shipped to the customer  or may not be shippable to a customer until a future period 
most orders included in backlog can be rescheduled or cancelled by customers without significant penalty 
historically  a substantial portion of net revenue in any fiscal period has been derived from orders received during that fiscal period 
our total backlog amounted to million as of july   compared to million as of june  the million increase in backlog between july  and june  was due primarily to strong bookings for multi year government programs and early volume orders for our quantum chip scale atomic clock 
our backlog shippable within the next six months was million as of july   compared to million as of june  contract revenue revenue from contracts that require development and manufacture in accordance with customer specifications and have a lengthy development period may be categorized into two types firm fixed price and cost plus reimbursement 
revenue is recognized under the fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  cost to cost basis principally based upon the costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs at completion on the individual contracts 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as 
table of contents soon as they are determinable 
revenue recognized under cost plus contracts is recognized on the basis of direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of costs or as performance based award fee 
revenue from long term contracts is reviewed periodically  with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
as of july   we had approximately million in contract revenue to be performed and recognized within the next months  compared to approximately million in contract revenue that was to be performed and recognized within the following months as of june  these amounts have been accounted for as part of our sales backlog discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources balance sheet and cash flows the following table summarizes our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in thousands july  june  change cash and cash equivalents short term investments total as of july   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and accounts receivable  net of million 
as of july   working capital was million compared to million as of june  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of july  decreased to million from million as of june  this decrease was due primarily to an increase in inventory of million  along with million of repurchases of common stock and million of purchases of plant and equipment 
our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days as of july   compared to days as of june  our principal uses of cash historically have consisted of the purchase of inventories  payroll and other operating expenses related to the manufacturing of products  development of new products and the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million 
the net cash provided by operating activities consisted of non cash charges of million and net income of million 
the non cash charges consisted of million in deferred income taxes  million in depreciation and amortization expenses  million in stock based compensation expense and million in provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was partially offset by million of net changes in operating assets and liabilities 
those net changes consisted primarily of a million increase in inventory primarily to support the transfer of manufacturing activity to a third party contract manufacturer  a decrease in accrued compensation of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in other accrued liabilities of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of million and a decrease in prepaid and other assets of million 
cash flows from investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal  which represented the sale maturities of short term investments of million  partially offset by the purchase of short term investments and property  plant and equipment of million and million  respectively 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities net cash used for financing activities was million in fiscal  which represented the repurchase of common stock of million  partially offset by cash generated from the exercise of common stock options of million 
we believe that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating and working capital expenditure needs in the ordinary course of business for at least the next months and the foreseeable future 
we base our expense levels in part on our expectation of future revenue levels 
if our revenue for a particular period is lower than we expect  we may take steps to reduce our operating expenses accordingly 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements or if we require additional capital resources to grow our business or to acquire complementary technologies and businesses in the future  we may seek to issue additional equity securities or obtain debt financing 
additional financing may not be available at all or on terms acceptable to us 
additional financing may also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
contractual obligations we operate in multiple locations domestically and internationally 
as such  certain facilities and equipment are leased under operating lease agreements 
due to excess capacity on several non cancelable leases as a result of the economic downturn and reorganization  we subleased certain facilities and recognized lease loss liabilities for the remainder 
we incur purchase commitments during our normal course of business 
as of july   our principal commitments totaled million and related primarily to commitments to purchase inventory 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of july   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands contractual obligations operating leases obligations purchase obligations post retirement benefits liabilities lease obligations on abandoned space total consists of lease obligations on space used by the company for operations and does not include lease obligations on space that has been abandoned 
relates to a post retirement health care benefits plan  assumed during an acquisition in fiscal the plan was curtailed in fiscal  and only existing retired participants and employees of the acquired company  now employed by symmetricom and meeting the retirement eligibility requirements by december   are eligible for participation 
the health care plan is a contributory plan 
consists of gross lease obligations on abandoned space whether sub leased or not 

table of contents uncertain tax positions of million consist of amounts included in the net deferred tax asset balance of million at july   which would affect our income tax expense if recognized 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities  we are unable to estimate the year in which the future cash flows may occur and therefore have not included them in the above table 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k for a discussion of the expected impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure as of july   we had short term investments of million 
these investments are mainly in government sponsored enterprise and corporate debt securities that have maturity dates of greater than three months 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk in as much as their fair value will fall if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates compared to rates at july  would not have materially affected the fair value of our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks inherent in these securities 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates relates primarily to the intercompany balances with our subsidiaries in the united kingdom  germany  china and india 
although we transact business in various countries  settlement amounts are usually based on united states currency 
transaction gains or losses have not been significant in the past and we do not presently engage in hedging activity 
a hypothetical adverse change in pound sterling  euro  chinese yuan renminbi or indian rupee against united states dollars shall not result in a material foreign exchange loss 
consequently  we do not expect that a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have a direct material impact on our business 
notwithstanding the foregoing analysis of the direct effects of interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations on the value of our investments and accounts  the indirect effects of such fluctuations could have a materially harmful effect on our business 
for example  international demand for our products is affected by foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect the buying patterns of our customers 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations have broad influence on the general condition of the united states  foreign and global economies which could materially harm our business
