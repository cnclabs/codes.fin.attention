item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors and elsewhere in this form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we believe we are one of the world s largest producers  based on manufacturing capacity  and a leading innovator of bimetallic wire products  principally copper clad aluminum  or cca  and copper clad steel  or ccs  products 
cca and ccs conductors are generally used as a substitute for solid copper conductors in applications for which either cost savings or specific electrical or physical attributes are necessary 
relative to solid copper wire  our customized  engineered bimetallic wire products significantly reduce the amount of copper metal required to manufacture a conductor  and because copper is expensive relative to aluminum and steel  our products significantly reduce conductor cost per unit length 
in  our products were sold to over customers in countries 
we market our products under the trademarked names of copperweld and fushitm  and sell primarily to cable manufacturers and to a less extent through distributors or sales agents to cable manufacturers 
although we are engaged in one line of business  as a result of different markets primarily served by each of our manufacturing facilities and significant differences in the operating results among each of our facilities  starting with the second fiscal quarter of  we began to manage our worldwide operations based on two geographic segments prc which consists of our facilities located in the people s republic of china prc and us which consists of our fayetteville  tennessee  us  and telford  england  uk facilities 
we have combined our us and us operations as one segment since the uk operating company is a subsidiary of the us operating company and its results are consolidated into the us operating company for our chief decision maker to review 
further  the nature of our products  services and production processes at our us and uk facilities  along with the customer base  methods to distribute products and services are nearly identical 
we believe we have a strong market position in all markets in which we compete due to the quality of our products  geographic and customer diversity and our ability to deliver superior products while operating as a low cost provider 
as a result  we believe we are now one of the leading producers of bimetallic wire products in the world and are one of the market leaders in north america  europe  north africa  the middle east and the prc 
we continue to expand within current and developing markets and create shareholder value by investing in organic growth in both infrastructure based and fast growing markets  focusing on margin enhancement through investment into new machinery and research and development that will improve the performance and capabilities of our bimetallic products and allow us to enter new markets  optimizing capacity and utilization rates throughout the company by focusing on key performance indicators and operational excellence  protecting and enhancing the fushi copperweld brand  and strategically hiring and developing talent  to improve the effectiveness of our performance management process  and pursuing acquisitions that expand our strategic capabilities  our access to customers and our product lines as well as downstream in our value chain 
to accomplish these goals  we are focused on continuously improving operational efficiency in areas we view to be vital quality  delivery  cost and innovation 
we also take an opportunistic approach to achieving our goals  and thus  we seek acquisitions of businesses which facilitate overall growth and cash flows of the company 
we manufacture  market and distribute bimetallic conductors two metal conductors 
these bimetallic conductors are primarily cca and ccs 
these conductors have either aluminum or steel cores  surrounded by an outer layer of pure copper  resulting in a composite bimetallic conductor 
the copper sheath  through our processing methods  is metallurgically bonded to the core metal 
the amount of copper metal used in cladding the core metal varies widely  and is based on customers needs 
however  bimetallic conductors  compared to solid copper conductors  can reduce the amount of copper used by as much as by volume  or by weight which is a considerable cost savings to the company and our customers 
for many applications  bimetallic conductors offer significant advantages over copper wire 
end user manufacturers in the industry have increasingly pursued and considered alternative technologies such as bimetallics due to performance and economic considerations 
relative to traditional copper conductors  bimetallic conductors offer greater value to a variety of customers 
because of the benefits of bimetallic conductors  we believe there are substantial opportunities to capture increased market share in applications that have historically been dominated by solid copper wire 
we believe our engineered bimetallic conductor products offer end users greater value performance than solid copper conductors 
our bimetallic conductors combine the efficiency of copper with the lightweight qualities of aluminum cca  or the ruggedness and strength of steel ccs 
bimetallic conductors offer favorable cost characteristics  weight savings cca  increased flexibility and end product ease of handling cca  increased tensile strength ccs  improved corrosion characteristics and decreased theft risk 
conductivity can be customized  by changing the percentage of copper  to fit many applications 
the physical and electrical attributes of our bimetallic products provide our customers cost savings beyond their intrinsic pricing advantages 
we believe our proprietary manufacturing technology allows us to produce superior products compared to other manufacturers and creates a significant barrier to entry 
manufacturing copper clad products involves bonding copper tape to an aluminum or steel core rod  drawing the clad product to a finished diameter and heat treating annealing as necessary depending on customer specifications 
our proprietary cladding process differentiates us in terms of manufacturing capabilities  offering superior product quality 
our developmental capabilities support the ongoing evolution of our current products 
we are continuously working toward new technologies and products that we expect to improve the performance and capabilities of our bimetallic products thereby allowing us to enter new markets 
while the pricing volatility of our raw materials  especially copper  is a primary cause of cost variations in our products  changes in raw material costs do not materially affect our dollar earnings on a per pound basis 
although an increase in the price of raw materials may serve to reduce our gross margins as a percentage of net sales  likewise  a decline in raw material prices may increase our gross margin as a percentage of revenues 
we generally pass the cost of price changes in our raw materials to our customers 
we establish prices for our products based on market factors and our cost to produce our products 
typically  we set a base price for our products for our customers with an understanding that as prices of raw materials change  primarily for copper but also for aluminum and steel  we will pass the change through to our customers 
therefore  when prices of raw material increase  our prices to our customers increase and the amount of our total revenues increases while the dollar amount of our gross margin remains relatively stable 
as a result  the impact on earnings per share from volatile raw material prices is minimal  although there are timing delays of varying lengths depending upon volatility of metals prices  the type of product  competitive conditions and particular customer arrangements 
factors driving and affecting operating results include raw material prices  product and price competition  economic conditions in various geographic regions  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  changes in technology  fluctuations in customer demand  variations in the mix of products  production capacity and utilization  working capital sufficiency  availability of credit and general market liquidity  patent and intellectual property issues  litigation results and legal and regulatory developments  and our ability to accurately forecast sales demand and calibrate manufacturing to such demand  manage volatile raw material costs  develop  manufacture and successfully market new and enhanced products and product lines  control operating costs  and attract  motivate and retain key personnel to manage our operational  financial and management information systems 
current business environment and outlook the bimetallic conductor industry is a subset of the broader wire and cable industry  which consumed approximately  mt of metallic center conductor in according to estimates by cru internatinal limited  a leading publisher of industry market research 
the global bimetallic wire industry  as well as the wire and cable industry  is fast growing and increasingly competitive 
this is especially true in the prc where there is considerable fragmentation of manufacturers 
we continue to see strong demand for our products and believe significant growth opportunities exist to capture a larger proportion of the metallic center conductor market relative to solid copper wire 
furthermore  we think the following macro level trends will positively impact our business and offer us opportunities to capture new business despite global economic conditions and preserve profitability continued investment in telecommunication projects in emerging economies  government initiatives focused on infrastructure high speed railways  transmission and distribution and power grid build out  continued strength of grounding wire market  worldwide underlying long term growth trends in electric utility and infrastructure markets  and continuing demand for cost effective  energy saving alternatives in addition to these macro level trends  the company is presented with tremendous opportunities brought by the addition of ccs cladding capacity at our dalian facility 
we believe this equipment is the first large scale  high quality ccs cladding capacity in asia 
we continue to educate the prc and asian markets on the benefits of ccs for the telecommunication  utilities  and transportation market in anticipation of large scale production of  mt of annual ccs capacity at our dalian facility in the third quarter of fiscal year initially  we intend to focus our ccs efforts on capturing market share in the catv drop cable market  according to the th five year program outline by the optical and electrical cable association of china  approximately  kilometers of catv drop cable was manufactured in the prc in this amount of catv cable represents the equivalent of approximately  mt of ccs center conductor  and to date has been primarily supplied by local copper plated steel cps manufacturers 
we believe cps to be an inferior product compared to ccs  and the absence of local  affordably priced ccs manufacturers in the prc results in catv manufacturers choosing cps in their production process 
as we introduce ccs production  we expect those market dynamics to shift to be more in line with those of developed markets  where ccs is the preferred center conductor of choice for catv drop cable 
in addition  we are seeking to continue to develop the high potential utility and transportation markets  to enhance productivity and to expand our sales of higher margin products 
we view the market for cca and ccs wires and cables within the utilities market to be worldwide 
in order to capture the growth opportunities  we will focus on driving profitability by streamlining our organizational structure and business procedures  increasing operational efficiency and optimizing operating processes  while managing production costs and operating expenses 
meanwhile  we are also working to strengthen our business development  sales  marketing and customer relations 
we will seek to approval for our products from product safety testing and certification organizations and inclusion in national and industry product standards throughout the world 
we view efforts in certification and standardization as vital aspects of our efforts to realize large scale conversion to bimetallic wire from solid copper wire 
in addition  as part of our ongoing efforts to reduce total operating costs  we continuously improve our ability to efficiently utilize existing and new manufacturing capacity to manage expansion and growth 
we believe that effectively utilized manufacturing assets  economy of scale generated  will help offset high raw material prices and dilute overhead over time  thus improving profitability 
we actively seek to identify and promptly respond to key economic and industry trends in order to capitalize on expanding niche markets for our products  and possibly entering into new markets both down and up stream  in order to achieve better returns 
we have the resources  technology  working capital and capacity to meet growing market demands 
over the long term  we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from the growth opportunities presented by infrastructure projects throughout the world

as of december   the us entities had incurred three years consecutive losses since the acquisition of copperweld 
in addition  the company approved a global expansion plan and a global marketing strategy 
under the global expansion plan  some of the production activities of the us entities may be transferred to other production plants outside the us in order to expand its global market share  the company will recruit senior marketing and business strategy executives to formulate strategic and action plans to push forward such initiative 
additional executive and marketing costs at the us entities level are expected to be incurred in the near term 
these changes in circumstances have resulted in a change in judgment about the future realizability of the us entities deferred income tax assets 
accordingly  we considered it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits of deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
a valuation allowance of million was provided in full of the deferred income tax assets of us entities as of december   of which million related to the beginning of the year balance of the deferred income tax assets

we are generally able to pass the cost of price changes in raw materials to customers 
the prc segment experienced a decrease of in revenues in compared to the majority of the decrease in prc revenues is due to a decrease in average selling prices of cca as a result of lower costs of raw materials 
this decrease was partially offset by a increase in sales volume 
the us segment experienced a significant decrease in revenues of in compared to in all major geographic sales regions with particular weakness in european and north american markets 
this decline in revenues is primarily the result of a decrease in sales volume and a decrease in the average selling price revenues by industry the following table presents the breakdown of revenues in millions by industry revenues for the year ended december  in millions  except percentage amount amount change in amount change in telecommunication utility transportation other total revenues the following table presents the breakdown of metric tons sold to customers by industry revenues fiscal year ended december  mt mt change in mt change telecommunication utility transportation other total sales volume in  our sales to the telecommunication markets decreased by metric tons  or  compared to  primarily due to lower sales within markets served by our us segment as a result of weak economic conditions  partially offset by continued strong demand for our cca products in the prc as a result of the g buildout

the decrease is primarily due to lower revenues as a result of decreased demand for our products within markets served by our us segment because of weak economic conditions 
this decrease was partially offset by higher gross margins and a increase in tons sold in our prc segment 
also  the above deceases have been partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses of million as result of cost saving initiatives implemented at operations in our us segment and a reduction in cost of professional fees at the corporate level 
the decrease in income from operations for the prc segment of million in  or  compared to in  is largely the result of lower revenues partially offset by higher gross margins and increased tons sold due to continued demand for our cca products within telecommunication and utility related markets due to the g build out and continued government investment for infrastructure related projects 
income from operations in the us segment decreased by million  or  in compared to  primarily due to lower revenues and tons sold compared to this decrease is largely the result of lower tons sold due to weak economic conditions

our financial condition continues to improve as measured by an increase of in shareholders equity as of december  compared to december  cash increased by million  primarily due to net proceeds of million from our public offering consummated in february  and the strong sales  which were partially offset by repayment of million of our hy notes 
accounts receivable decreased by as a result of collection of aged debtors 
we entered into a new credit facility resulting in a million bank loan as at december  liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations and capital expenditures principally through private placements of debt and equity  bank loans  and cash provided by operations 
significant factors affecting our cash liquidity include cash provided by operating activities  cash used for capital expenditures  and our available credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements 
at december   the majority of our cash were held in rmb denominated bank deposits with the prc financial institutions 
the prc has strict rules for converting rmb to other currencies and for movement of funds from prc subsidiaries to the us holding company 
consequently  we used funds from our public offering in the first quarter to invest in our non prc operations and have secured new working capital lines for non prc operations as our sales increase and our working capital needs grow 
under prc company law and relevant rules and regulations  our prc subsidiaries may pay dividends only out of their retained earnings net profit  if any  calculated according to prc accounting standards  and only after accumulated losses from preceding years have been fully covered and the following appropriations have been made a appropriations to the statutory surplus reserve equivalent to of its net profits less any accumulated losses  as determined under prc gaap  no further appropriations to the statutory surplus reserve are required once this reserve reaches an amount equal to of its respective registered capital  b appropriations to a discretionary surplus reserve as approved by the shareholders in shareholders meeting 
as is customary in the industry  we provide payment terms to most of our customers that exceed terms that we receive from our suppliers 
therefore  the company s liquidity needs have generally consisted of working capital necessary to finance receivables and raw material inventory 
capital expenditures have historically been necessary to expand the production capacity of the company s manufacturing operations 

we expect that we will be able to meet our needs to fund operations  capital expenditures and other commitments in the next months primarily with operating cash flows 
the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented for the year end december  in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash cash at beginning of year cash at end of year year ended december  in  net cash provided by operating activities was million  an increase of million compared to  reflecting a significant improvement in operating cash flows 
the favorable changes are primarily attributable to a million increase in cash collection for revenues and offset by a million increase in cash expenditures to purchase raw materials 
in  net cash used in investing activities was million  which was primarily attributable to million paid for jinchuan acquisition  million paid for hongtai acquisition and the payment for land use right in jiangsu amounting to million 
the company paid additional million to the selling shareholders of jinchuan in january since jinchuan met the performance targets for the year ended december  in  net cash provided by financing activities was million  which was primarily attributable to the net proceeds of million from an issuance of our common stock during the first quarter of and a long term facility provided by regions bank amounting to million  partially offset by a million payment to extinguish our hy notes and million payment to terminate the revolving line of credit 
years ended december  and in  net cash provided by operating activities was million  an increase of million compared to  reflecting a significant improvement in operating cash flows 
the changes is primarily due to million decrease in cash expenditures to purchase raw materials and partially offset by million decrease in cash collection for revenues 
in  net cash used in investing activities was million  which was primarily attributable to million purchase of property  plant and equipment 
in  net cash used in investing activities was million  which was primarily attributable to million purchase of property  plant and equipment

days sales outstanding dso has decreased from days at december   to days at december   while days payable outstanding dpo decreased to days as of december   from days at december  the decrease in dso is primarily attributable to our increased efforts for accounts receivables collection  in addition to existing procedures established to facilitate collection 
meanwhile  we continued our policy on extending credit terms to certain credible customers that have long standing business relationships with us in order to capture additional market share 
we believe that our ability to extend credit terms puts pressure on our smaller competitors whose limited capital resources have become further strained due to the global economic crisis and who are unable to make such adjustments for customers 
standard customer and supplier payment terms days as below year ended december  year ended december  customer payment term from payment in advance up to days payment in advance up to days supplier payment term from payment in advance up to days payment in advance up to days inventory days on hand increased from days at december  to days at december  advance to supplier s turnover days has decreased from days at december   to days at december  the company s principal raw materials consist of aluminum  steel rods and copper strips 
changes in the price of copper  which has an established history of volatility  directly affects the prices of the company s products and influence the demand for products 
the company s decision to make advanced purchases of raw materials is mainly based upon the current and projected future market price of raw materials  the demand and supply situation in the raw materials market  and the forecasted demand of products 
the increased investment in both inventory and advance to suppliers in was primarily due to the projected increased demand of our products

the table above does not include royalty payments to nexans as the amounts  timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
the amounts of royalty payments typically will not be determined until sales revenues have been generated 
legal proceedings please refer to part i  item of this annual report on form k for information on legal proceedings 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap  which requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  the disclosure of our contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period 
we continually evaluate these judgments  estimates and assumptions based on our own historical experience  knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions and our expectations regarding the future based on available information which together form our basis for making judgments about matters that are not readily apparent from other sources 
since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process  our actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of our accounting policies require a higher degree of judgment than others in their application 
when reading our consolidated financial statements  you should consider our selection of critical accounting policies  the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies  and the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions 
we believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
principles of consolidation the company s consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of fushi  its wholly owned subsidiaries  and dalian fushi  a variable interest entity in which the company is the primary beneficiary 
all significant inter company transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation 
the company has no direct or indirect legal ownership interest in dalian fushi 
however  through a series of contractual agreements  including entrusted management agreement  voting proxy agreement  the share pledge agreement and exclusive option agreement collectively  the restructuring agreements among fushi international  dalian fushi and its shareholders  dalian fushi s shareholders have assigned all their rights as shareholders  including voting rights and disposition rights of their equity interests in dalian fushi to the company 
in accordance with accounting standards codification  dalian fushi is determined to be a variable interest entity because its holders of the equity investments do not participate significantly in income and losses and do not possess the direct or indirect ability through voting or similar rights to make decisions regarding its activities that have a significant effect on the success of dalian fushi 
through the restructuring agreements  the company has a controlling financial interest in dalian fushi because it has i the power to direct activities of dalian fushi that most significantly impact the economic performance of dalian fushi and ii the obligation to absorb losses from or the right to receive benefits of dalian fushi that could potentially be significant to dalian fushi 
therefore  in accordance with accounting standards codification a  the company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of dalian fushi and consolidates dalian fushi in its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
in establishing the required allowance  management considers historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions and customers financial condition  the amount of receivables in dispute  and the current receivables aging and current payment patterns 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
the company does not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers 
the company extends unsecured credit to customers with good credit history 
management reviews its accounts receivable on a regular basis to determine if the bad debt allowance is adequate at each year end 
we have not experienced any write offs in our prc operations and no material write off of accounts receivable in our us operations 
at december  and  we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of usd  and usd  respectively 
aging analysis of accounts receivable december  december  days days days days days over days bad debts allowance total long lived assets our long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  land use rights and goodwill 
except for goodwill  we depreciate and amortize our property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and land use rights  using the straight line method of accounting over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we make estimates of the useful lives of property  plant and equipment  including the salvage values  intangible assets and land use rights in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during each reporting period 
we estimate the useful lives at the time the assets are acquired based on historical experience with similar assets 
we evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets subject to amortization  and land use rights for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we assess recoverability by comparing carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  we recognize an impairment charge based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group 
we estimate the fair value of the asset or asset group based on the best information available  including prices for similar assets and in the absence of an observable market price  the results of using a present value technique to estimate the fair value of the asset or asset group 
we evaluate goodwill at least annually for impairment  and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that it might be impaired 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level at the end of each year 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment  or a component 
a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount  including allocated goodwill 
secondly  if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  we then recognize an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
we determine the implied fair value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the determination of fair value of the reporting unit and the assets and liabilities within the reporting unit requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  revenue growth rates  gross margin percentages  earnings before depreciation and amortization  projected working capital needs  capital expenditures forecasts  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
to determine fair value  we discount the expected cash flows of the reporting unit 
the discount rate used represents the estimated weighted average cost of capital  which reflects the overall level of inherent risk involved in the reporting unit s operations and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the model  we use a terminal value approach 
under this approach  we use the estimated cash flows in the final year of the models and apply a perpetuity growth assumption and discount the relative cash flows by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value 
we incorporate the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value 
no impairment on our long lived assets was recognized in  and revenue recognition revenue is recognized when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the products has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these criteria as they relate to each of the following major revenue generating activities are described below 
for sales to prc customers  products are considered delivered when they reach the customers location and are accepted by customers  which is the point when the customers take ownership and assume risk of loss 
for sales to us and overseas customers  products are considered delivered when they reach the named port of shipment or destination  which is the point when the customers take ownership and assume risk of loss 
delivery is evidenced by a signed customer acceptance form for prc sales and is evidenced by signed bills of lading for sales to us and overseas customers 
the company s sales agreements do not provide customers the right of return  price protection or any other concessions 
however  the company allows for an exchange of products or return if the products are defective 
for the years presented  defective product returns were immaterial 
although most of our products are covered by our warranty programs  the terms and conditions of which vary depending on the customers and the product sold 
because we have not experienced any significant warranty claims in the past  we have not established any reserve for warranty claims or defective products 
the company s sales are net value added tax vat collected on behalf of tax authorities in respect of product sales 
vat collected from customers  net of vat paid for purchases  is recorded as a liability in the balance sheet until it is paid to the tax authorities 
income tax uncertainties and realization of deferred income tax assets income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates or tax laws is recognized in the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income in the period the change in tax rates or tax laws is enacted 
a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the carrying amount of deferred income tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
as of december  and  we had total gross deferred income tax assets of usd million and usd million  respectively 
the deferred income tax assets are mainly relating to the tax loss carryforwards and other temporary differences of the company and its us subsidiaries us entities which files a consolidated tax return in the us 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets if  based on the weight of available evidence  we believe expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction 
as of december  and  our valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets was usd million and usd million  respectively 
the incease in the valuation allowance is because of a substantial change in the company s global business strategy during which creates uncertainty on the future profitability of the us entities 
during  the company approved a global expansion plan and a global marketing strategy 
in order to expand its global market share  the company will recruit senior marketing and business strategy executives to formulate strategic and action plans to push forward such initiative 
additional executive and marketing costs at the company level are expected to be incurred in the near term 
these changes in circumstances have resulted in a change in judgment about the future realizability of the us entities deferred income tax assets 
therefore  a valuation allowance of usd million against the beginning of the year balance of the deferred income tax assets was provided as of december  we recognize the impact of a tax position if we determine the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based solely on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  it is presumed that the position will be examined by the appropriate tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
in addition  a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
the tax positions are regularly reevaluated based on the results of the examination of income tax filings  statute of limitations expirations and changes in tax law that would either increase or decrease the technical merits of a position relative to the more likely than not recognition threshold 
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs 
the company has elected to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits  if and when required  as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income 
share based compensation we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize the cost over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which generally is the vesting period 
we have elected to recognize the compensation cost for an award with only service conditions and a graded vesting schedule on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
however  the cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any date equals at least the portion of the grant date value of such award that is vested at that date 
we estimated the fair value of our share options using the black scholes option pricing model 
the model incorporates expected various and highly subjective assumption 
the expected volatility was based on implied volatilities from traded options  peer companies volatilities and historical volatility of the company s common stocks 
the risk free interest rate assumption is determined using the federal reserve nominal rates for us treasury zero coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued 
there is no expected dividend yield  as the company has not paid dividend and does not anticipate to pay dividend over the term of the grants 
changes in our estimates and assumptions regarding the expected volatility could significantly impact the estimated fair values of our share options determined under the black scholes valuation model and  as a result  our net income 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not engaged in any off balance sheet transactions since inception 
subsequent events on april   copperweld failed to provide the audited annual consolidated financial statements of fushi to the regions bank by march  on april   the company received a waiver from the regions bank pursuant to which the regions bank waived its rights until april  for the company to provide the bank with its audited consolidated financial statements by that date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s commodity price risk certain raw materials used by us are subject to price volatility caused by supply conditions  political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors 
the primary purpose of our commodity price management activities is to manage the volatility associated with purchases of commodities in the normal course of business 
we do not speculate on commodity prices 
we are primarily exposed to price risk related to our purchase of copper used in the manufacture of our products 
we purchase most of our raw materials at prevailing market prices 
we do not have formal long term purchase contracts with our suppliers and  therefore  we are exposed to the risk of fluctuating raw material prices 
our raw material price risk is mitigated because we generally pass changes in raw material costs to our customers 
we did not have any commodity price derivatives or hedging arrangements outstanding at december  and did not employ any commodity price derivatives in foreign exchange risk while our reporting currency is the usd  a significant portion of our consolidated revenues and consolidated costs and expenses are denominated in rmb 
furthermore  a significant portion of our assets are denominated in rmb 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between usd and rmb 
if the rmb depreciates against the usd  the value of our rmb revenues  earnings and assets as expressed in our usd financial statements will decline 
assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates at the balance sheet dates and revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates and shareholders equity is translated at historical exchange rates 
any resulting translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are included in determining other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
a average appreciation depreciation of the rmb against the usd would increase decrease our comprehensive income by  based on our revenues  costs and expenses  assets and liabilities denominated in rmb as of december  as of december   our accumulated foreign currency translation gain as part of accumulated other comprehensive income amounted to  and our foreign currency translation gain recognized in other comprehensive income in was  we entered into a cross currency interest swap derivative in  which was terminated in we do not intend to enter into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk in the future 
the value of the rmb against the usd and other currencies is affected by  among other things  changes in the prc s political and economic conditions 
since july  the rmb has not been pegged to the usd 
although the people s bank of china regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short term fluctuations in the exchange rate  the rmb may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the usd in the medium to long term 
moreover  it is possible that in the future  prc authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the rmb exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market 
credit risk we have not experienced significant credit risk  as most of our customers are long term customers with good payment records 
we review our accounts receivable on a regular basis to determine if the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate at each quarter end 
we typically only extend to day trade credit to our largest customers that tend to be well established and large businesses  although we do on occasion extend credit beyond days when we believe a particular contract to be of important strategic interest 
we have rarely seen accounts receivable uncollected beyond contract terms and have experienced minimal write off of accounts receivable in the past 
inflation risk inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs
