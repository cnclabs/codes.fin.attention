item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview cliffs natural resources inc traces its corporate history back to today  we are an international mining and natural resources company 
a member of the s p index  we are the largest producer of iron ore pellets in north america  a major supplier of direct shipping lump and fines iron ore out of australia  and a significant producer of metallurgical coal 
our company s operations are organized according to product category and geographic location north american iron ore  north american coal  asia pacific iron ore asia pacific coal  latin american iron ore  alternative energies  ferroalloys  and our global exploration group 
over recent years  we have been executing a strategy designed to achieve scale in the mining industry and focused on serving the world s largest and fastest growing steel markets 
in north america  we operate six iron ore mines in michigan  minnesota and eastern canada  five metallurgical coal mines located in west virginia and alabama and one thermal coal mine located in west virginia 
our asia pacific operations are comprised of two iron ore mining complexes in western australia  serving the asian iron ore markets with direct shipping fines and lump ore  and a percent economic interest in a coking and thermal coal mine located in queensland  australia 
in latin america  we have a percent interest in amap  a brazilian iron ore project  and in ontario  canada  we have recently acquired chromite properties 
our operations also include our percent controlling interest in renewafuel located in michigan 
in addition  our global exploration group was established in and is focused on early involvement in exploration activities to identify new world class projects for future development or projects that add significant value to existing operations 
the strengthening recovery and improving outlook during was characterized by increased steel production  higher demand and rising prices 
in  global crude steel production  a significant driver of our business  was up approximately percent from with even greater production increases in some areas  including north america  where the economy grew at an annual rate of nearly three percent during steel production in china also remained strong  increasing percent from consolidated revenues for increased to billion  with net income per diluted share of 
this compares with revenues of billion and net income per diluted share of in based on the signs of marked improvement in customer demand  we increased production at all of our facilities in order to meet increases in demand 
higher sales volumes in north america during the year were attributable to increased sales of iron ore pellets  as well as metallurgical and thermal coal made available through our acquisitions of wabush and clcc during the first and third quarters of  respectively 
in asia pacific  the demand for steelmaking raw materials remained strong throughout primarily led by demand from china 
earlier in  the world s largest iron ore producers moved away from the annual international benchmark pricing mechanism referenced in our customer supply agreements  resulting in a shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market 
we finalized short term pricing arrangements with our asia pacific iron ore customers and reached final pricing settlements with some of our north american customers through the fourth quarter of for the contract year  reflecting significant increases over prices 
although pricing has been settled with some of our north american customers for  we are still in the process of assessing the impact a change to the historical annual pricing mechanism will have on certain of our larger existing north american iron ore customer supply agreements that extend over multiple years  and negotiations are still ongoing with these customers 
results in reflect strong performance at our operations around the world and improved pricing for our products 
our strong cash flow generation and positive outlook for our business are allowing us to resume our focus on investments in our assets  which will enable us to continue to pursue strategic objectives and enhance our long term operating performance  while also providing us with greater confidence and the ability to increase our cash payouts to shareholders 
in may  our board of directors increased our quarterly common share dividend from to per share

growth strategy and strategic transactions throughout  we continued to increase our operating scale and presence as an international mining and natural resources company by expanding both geographically and through the minerals we mine and market 
the long term outlook remains healthy and we are now focusing on our growth projects with sustained investment in our core businesses 
our growth in north america  as well as acquisitions in minerals outside of iron ore and coal  illustrate the execution of this strategy during we also expect to achieve growth through early involvement in exploration activities by partnering with junior mining companies  which provide us low cost entry points for potentially significant reserve additions 
we continued our strategic growth and transformation to an international mining and natural resources company through the following transactions acquisition of remaining interest in freewest acquisition of remaining interest in wabush acquisition of certain coal operations of privately owned inr acquisition of spider we plan to continue to execute our strategy in through acquisitions such as the pending acquisition of consolidated thompson that was announced in january and is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various closing conditions 
the freewest  wabush  clcc  and spider acquisitions allowed us to increase production capacity and add additional reserves at our north american iron ore and north american coal businesses  gain additional access to the seaborne iron ore markets serving steelmakers in europe and asia  and further broaden our mineral and customer diversification 
the agreement to acquire consolidated thompson will allow us to continue to build scale within our north american iron ore business through the acquired ownership of expandable and exportable steelmaking raw material assets serving international markets

improving market conditions throughout led to increasing production in the north american steel industry  and in turn higher demand for iron ore and metallurgical coal 
higher sales volumes in were also attributable to increased sales of wabush pellets  made available through our acquisition of full ownership of the mine during the first quarter of  and increased sales of metallurgical and thermal coal  made available through our acquisition of clcc during the third quarter of higher sales prices also contributed to the increase in our consolidated revenue for the year ended a recent shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements that are linked to the spot market and elimination of the annual benchmark system caused us to reassess and  in some cases  renegotiate the terms of certain of our supply agreements  primarily with our north american iron ore and asia pacific iron ore customers 
we renegotiated the terms of our supply agreements with our chinese and japanese asia pacific iron ore customers moving to shorter term pricing mechanisms of various durations based on the average daily spot prices  with certain pricing mechanisms that have a duration of up to a quarter 
this change was effective in the first quarter of for our chinese customers and the second quarter of for our japanese customers 
the increase in pricing was on average an percent and percent increase for lump and fines  respectively 
in north america  we reached final pricing settlement with some of our north american iron ore customers through the fourth quarter of the increase in pricing was an average increase of percent over prices for contracts based on world pellet prices 
although pricing has been settled with some of our north american customers for  for the contract year  we are still in the process of assessing the impact a change to the historical annual pricing mechanism will have on certain of our larger existing north american iron ore customer supply agreements that extend over multiple years  and negotiations are still ongoing with these customers

revenue in also included million related to supplemental contract payments compared with million in the overall increase between years relates to the estimated rise in average annual hot band steel pricing for one of our north american iron ore customers 
the increase in revenue was partially offset by lower prices realized for sales under one of our customer supply agreements that is currently in arbitration 
given the early stage of the arbitration  as discussed below  and the uncertainty regarding its outcome as of december   the prices realized for sales under this contract in do not reflect the estimated increase in iron ore pricing 
throughout  we have been party to two arbitration demands that were filed in relation to the pricing provisions referenced in the supply contracts for two of our largest customers 
one arbitration relates to amendments of the supply contracts made necessary by changes in the world pellet pricing mechanism in  specifically the move away from annual benchmark prices 
in december  a binding decision was reached by the arbitration panel that redefined world prices for blast furnace pellets  a factor used in determining annual price increases or decreases under the agreement 
although we received a million settlement payment from the customer in january  the customer is maintaining a court application to vacate the arbitration award 
we are vigorously contesting the customer s motion to vacate the award and we have counterclaimed to confirm the award 
currently  invoices and revenue are calculated pursuant to the arbitration panel s decision 
the other arbitration relates to a price reopener provision in the customer supply agreement and whether we are entitled to such a reopener for we are currently awaiting a ruling from the arbitration panel  however  we expect that we may collect approximately million related to this arbitration in the outcome of such arbitrations may result in changes to the pricing mechanisms used and therefore  could impact sales prices realized in current and future periods

the increase over the prior year was primarily related to production curtailments that occurred in to match declining market conditions as well as delays in developing the longwall panel at oak grove during the first quarter of in addition  the increase in production levels over the prior year was a direct result of the acquisition of clcc during the third quarter of the overall increase in current year production at our pinnacle complex was partially offset by a decrease in production at green ridge due to the planned closure of green ridge no 
in february as well as the idling of green ridge no 
during production recommenced at the green ridge no 
mine in january despite the increase in production over the prior year  our pinnacle mine was negatively impacted during by adverse geological conditions and delayed longwall operations  resulting in force majeures being declared on customer shipments during the third and fourth quarters of the force majeure declared in the fourth quarter was due to roof falls at the pinnacle mine and was lifted in january with the restarting of the longwall

sales margin for asia pacific iron ore increased to million in compared with million in revenue increased million in compared with the prior year primarily as a result of higher prices for lump and fines  increased sales volume and favorable sales mix 
during the first quarter of  the world s largest iron ore producers moved away from the annual international benchmark pricing mechanism referenced in our customer supply agreements  resulting in a shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market 
as a result  we renegotiated the terms of our supply agreements with our chinese and japanese asia pacific iron ore customers moving to shorter term pricing mechanisms of various durations based on the average daily spot prices  with certain pricing mechanisms that have a duration of up to a quarter 
this change was effective in the first quarter of for our chinese customers and the second quarter of for our japanese customers 
the increase in pricing over was on average an percent and percent increase for lump and fines  respectively 
this compares to settled price decreases in the prior year of percent and percent for lump and fines  respectively 
pricing settlements in the current year reflect the increase in steel demand and spot prices for iron ore and are based upon quarterly index pricing mechanisms 
sales volume reached million metric tons in compared with million metric tons for the prior year  resulting in an increase in revenue of million 
in addition  revenue was favorably impacted by a positive sales mix variance of million primarily due to the cessation of low grade fines sales in 
table of contents cost of goods sold and operating expenses in increased million compared to primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate variances of million coupled with a nine percent increase in sales volume  which resulted in cost increases of approximately million 
the overall increase in cost was partially offset by favorable rate variances  driven by lower inventory movement of million primarily due to increased long term stockpile utilization and million associated with lower shipping and processing costs during higher royalties related to the increase in revenue  higher mining costs related to increased mining fleet maintenance and higher depletion costs due to increased rail volumes of million partially offset the favorable rate variance 
production production at asia pacific iron ore in was higher than as a result of increased sales demand in and initiatives taken to improve supply conditions and eliminate certain production and logistics constraints  including upgrades to the rail system 
the increase in production over the prior year is also due to reduced availability in as a result of repairs to the production plant

revenue in decreased million  or percent  compared with primarily as a result of a percent decline in sales volume  which contributed million to the overall decrease in revenue 
the decline in sales volume was a result of the economic downturn and its impact on the global steel industry  which led to a decline in demand for steel making products in north america during in addition to the year over year decline in sales volume  reported price settlements for iron ore pellets reflected a decrease of approximately percent below prices  compared with an increase of percent in as a result  base rate adjustments related to estimated reductions in world pellet pricing and producer price indices contributed to a million decline in revenues in revenue in included approximately million related to supplemental contract payments compared with million in the decrease between periods related to the estimated decline in average annual hot band steel pricing for one of our north american iron ore customers 
in and  certain customers purchased and paid for approximately million tons and million tons of pellets  respectively  in order to meet minimum contractual purchase requirements for each year under the terms of take or pay contracts 
the inventory was stored at our facilities in upper lakes stockpiles 
at the request 
table of contents of the customers  the ore was not shipped  resulting in deferred revenue at december  and of million and million  respectively 
as of december   all of the million tons that were deferred at the end of were delivered  resulting in the related revenue being recognized in furthermore  the supply agreement with one of our customers required the customer to pay for any tons remaining under its nomination in addition to certain stockpile payments by december  there were approximately million unshipped tons remaining under the customer s nomination and million tons related to december shipments  for which payment of million was due on december  per the terms of the contract 
the customer did not remit payment of this amount until january  as a result  such amounts were not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
cost of goods sold and operating expense in decreased million or percent from the prior year primarily due to lower sales volume  which resulted in cost reductions of approximately million 
the overall decrease was partially offset by idle expense of million related to production curtailments at nearly all of the north american iron ore mines during in order to balance production with anticipated sales demand 
in addition  cost of goods sold and operating expenses were unfavorably impacted in by approximately million due to higher cost rates 
the increase was primarily attributable to million of higher labor costs related to the new labor agreement entered into in september at our iron ore facilities as well as higher fringe rates combined with an increase of million related to higher energy costs 
this was partially offset by a million reduction in fuel costs  a decrease in royalty costs of million as a result of lower iron ore pellet pricing  and cost reductions of million related to ongoing cash conservation efforts during in addition  due to lower partner demand  cliffs acquired million tons produced at tilden and wabush from the mine partners share at variable cost  which resulted in a favorable cost impact of approximately million in production in response to the economic downturn  we continued to rationalize production to match customer demand 
in  we reduced production at our six north american iron ore mines to million equity tons compared with production of million equity tons 
based on signs of marked improvements in customer demand beginning in the second half of  we increased production at most of our facilities and called employees back to work in order to ensure that we were positioned to meet increases in demand 
during the fourth quarter of  tilden and united taconite began operating at full capacity 
northshore was operating its two large furnaces  and empire continued to maintain its production levels 
wabush was operating two of its three furnaces with cliffs taking essentially all of the tonnage

table of contents we reported sales margin losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue of million in was percent lower than revenue in the decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a percent decline in sales volume as a result of market conditions which adversely impacted the demand for steel making raw materials throughout cost of goods sold and operating expense in decreased million or percent from primarily due to lower sales volume  which resulted in cost reductions of approximately million 
the decrease in sales volume also resulted in a decline in freight costs of million and a reduction in royalty costs of million 
in addition  in response to the economic downturn  we decreased spending across the north american coal business segment and idled production at both the oak grove and pinnacle complexes during production curtailments and headcount reductions during resulted in lower production related costs  including maintenance  supplies  and labor costs 
headcount reductions resulted in labor and benefit cost reductions of million in spending on operating supplies and maintenance costs was reduced in by approximately million as we continued to focus on cash conservation and cost management strategies 
however  these cost reductions were more than offset by higher cost per ton rates in  due to the impact of lower volume  resulting in an overall unfavorable rate variance of million 
cost of goods sold and operating expenses in were also negatively impacted by an increase in idle expense and production volume variance of million related to production curtailments at both mine locations during the year and delays associated with development of longwall panels at oak grove in early production metallurgical coal demand decreased in as the steel industry cut back production in response to the global economic slowdown 
as a result  we initiated plans in to align production with customer demand 
in west virginia  production was idled at our green ridge mines for part of the year  and production at our pinnacle mine was temporarily suspended 
in alabama  operating levels were also reduced at our oak grove mine 
however  production levels began to increase at the end of due to improvements in market conditions and increases in customer demand 
in particular  during the fourth quarter  production increased at oak grove and development was also accelerated to avoid downtime in at pinnacle  the longwall move was completed and we resumed production in mid october 
these production adjustments at north american coal resulted in a annual operating rate of approximately million tons 
this compares with production of million tons 
the oak grove mine was idled towards the end of due to ventilation  water and roofing issues at the mine 
msha denied our request to continue limited production while we addressed these issues 
oak grove continued to operate a continuous miner section to develop future longwall panels 
msha approval was received on february  for longwall operations to resume

cockatoo production reflects our percent share 

table of contents sales margin for asia pacific iron ore declined to million in compared with million in revenue decreased percent in primarily as a result of lower pricing for lump and fines during the year compared with prices 
while the benchmark prices for iron ore lump and fines did not settle with all of our customers  we negotiated pricing arrangements with certain customers in china to reflect the decline in steel demand and prices 
pricing decreases in of percent and percent for lump and fines  respectively  contrasted with settled price increases in of percent and percent  respectively 
pricing in was based upon previously reported settlements in japan and worldwide pressures in the market and remained unchanged from the estimates we made throughout most of the overall decline in revenue was partially offset by a favorable variance of million due to a nine percent increase in sales volume as a result of increased demand as well as a positive sales mix variance of million due to more sales of lump and fines at higher prices and reduced sales of low grade fines 
cost of goods sold and operating expenses in were relatively consistent with costs were unfavorably impacted by approximately million of amortization expense related to the accounting for the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in asia pacific iron ore  which occurred during the second half of costs in also increased by approximately million due to higher sales volumes as well as higher shipping costs of million due to freight arrangements with customers to secure sales during the period

refer to the statements of consolidated cash flows for additional information 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was billion in  compared with million in and million in operating cash flows in were primarily impacted by higher operating results  as previously noted 
our operating cash flows vary with prices realized from iron ore and coal sales  production levels  production costs  cash payments for income taxes and interest  other working capital changes and other factors 
as a result of improved economic conditions  operating plans for reflect increased production and modestly higher prices for iron ore and coal 
the long term outlook remains strong and we are now focusing on our growth projects with sustained investment in our core businesses 
throughout  capacity utilization among steelmaking facilities in north america demonstrated ongoing improvement 
the industry continued to show signs of stabilization based on increasing steel production and the restarting of blast furnaces in north america and europe 
as a result  we experienced marked improvements in customer demand and market expectations and increased production at most of our facilities 

table of contents based on current mine plans and subject to future iron ore and coal prices  we expect estimated operating cash flows in to be greater than our budgeted investments and capital expenditures  expected debt payments  dividends  and other cash requirements 
this expectation excludes acquisition activities related to the pending acquisition of consolidated thompson

investing activities in also included million of capital contributions related to the funding of operations at amap as well as million related to the repayment of all amap s debt in this compares with capital contributions of million related to our investment in amap during in february  we completed the acquisition of the remaining percent interest in wabush for an aggregate acquisition price of million 
we also completed the acquisition of all of the coal operations of clcc in july for an aggregate acquisition price of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of spider through an amalgamation  increasing our ownership interest to percent and resulting in a total cash investment in spider of million as of december  in december  our north american coal segment sold the new longwall plow system at our pinnacle mine in west virginia and subsequently leased the longwall back for a period of ten years 
we received proceeds of million from the sale of the longwall  and the leaseback was accounted for as a capital lease 
significant investing activities in included the sale of a fleet of asia pacific iron ore rail cars that were subsequently leased back for a period of ten years 
we received proceeds of million from the sale of the rail cars  and the leaseback was accounted for as a capital lease 
non cash investing activities during included the issuance of million of our common shares valued at million as part of the purchase consideration for the acquisition of the remaining interest in freewest  which was completed on january  non cash items during also included gains of million primarily related to the remeasurement of our previous ownership interest in freewest and wabush held prior to each business acquisition 
based upon improving market conditions and a strengthening long term outlook  we anticipate that total cash used for capital expenditures in will be approximately million 
this expectation excludes capital expenditures related to the pending acquisition of consolidated thompson 
as we continue to increase production into  capital expenditures will include the expansion of our empire and tilden mines in michigan s upper peninsula in order to increase production capacity 
the project has currently been approved for capital investments in equipment of approximately million  of which approximately million is expected to be spent in in asia pacific  an expansion project has been approved at our koolyanobbing mine in order to increase production capacity to million metric tons per year 
we estimate the project to require an initial capital cash outflow of approximately million  of which approximately million was spent in and million is expected to be spent in at pinnacle  a new longwall plow system was purchased to reduce maintenance costs and increase production at the mine 
remaining expenditures for the new longwall plow system of approximately million are expected to be made in the remaining expenditures are related to the longwall plow system assets pending delivery  therefore  they were not included within the longwall sale leaseback discussed above 
construction of a new portal at oak grove will continue in in order to improve productivity and support growth and expansion of the mine 
the portal requires a total capital investment of approximately million  of which million was committed and million was spent in remaining expenditures for the portal of approximately million are expected to be made in we are also in the process of upgrading the preparation plant at pinnacle in order to increase product yield and plant availability 
the modification project requires a capital investment of approximately million  of which million was spent in additional significant capital expenditures are expected in related to our pending acquisition of consolidated thompson 
we have implemented a global exploration program  which is integral to our growth strategy and is focused on identifying and capturing new world class projects for future development or projects that add significant 
table of contents value to existing operations 
our global exploration group is expected to spend between million and million on exploration activities in  which we expect will provide us with opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions globally 
throughout  we incurred expenses of million and investments of million related to our involvement in exploration activities 
we continue to evaluate funding options for our capital needs and expect to be able to fund these requirements through operations and availability under our existing borrowing arrangements

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in was billion compared with million in and million in cash flows from financing activities in primarily included million and million in net proceeds  respectively  from two public offerings of senior notes  which we completed on march  and september   respectively 
a portion of the net proceeds from the million public offering of senior notes were used for the repayment of our million term loan under our credit facility  which we repaid in march  as well as the repayment of our share of amap s remaining debt outstanding of million in may in addition  a portion of the net proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the spider and clcc acquisitions 
a portion of the net proceeds from the billion public offering of senior notes were used for the repayment of the million borrowings outstanding under our credit facility 
other uses of the net proceeds from the billion public offering of senior notes may include general corporate purposes  the funding of strategic acquisitions such as the pending acquisition of consolidated thompson and pending final use  investments in short term marketable securities 
successful execution of these offerings allowed us to enhance our financial flexibility and better position ourselves to take advantage of possible opportunities as the market continues to improve in in may  our board of directors increased our quarterly common share dividend from to per share 
the increased cash dividend was paid on june   september  and december  in may  our board of directors enacted a percent reduction in our quarterly common share dividend to from for the second and third quarters of in order to enhance financial flexibility 
in the fourth quarter of  the dividend was reinstated to its previous level 
cash flows from financing activities in primarily included million in net proceeds from the sale of our common shares 
as previously discussed  on january   we entered into a definitive arrangement agreement with consolidated thompson to acquire all of its common shares in an all cash transaction including net debt  valued at approximately c billion 
we have currently entered into a billion bridge financing commitment to provide for the financing of the arrangement 
we intend to arrange permanent financing for the transaction by  among other things  accessing the capital markets depending on market conditions during a portion of our cash will also be used to fund a portion of the purchase price  however management focus is on maintaining sufficient cash balances to address our future operational needs

table of contents refer to note debt and credit facilities of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our debt and credit facilities 
we are subject to certain financial covenants contained in the agreements governing certain of our debt instruments 
as of december  and  we were in compliance with each of our financial covenants 
apart from cash generated by the business  our primary source of funding is cash on hand  which totaled billion as of december  we also have a million revolving credit facility  which matures in this facility has available borrowing capacity of million as of december  effective october   we amended our credit facility agreement  which resulted in improved borrowing flexibility  more liberally defined financial covenants and debt restrictions  and other benefits in exchange for a modest increase in pricing 
the combination of cash and the credit facility gives us over billion in liquidity entering the first quarter of  which is expected to be used to fund operations and finance strategic transactions such as the pending acquisition of consolidated thompson 
we are party to financing arrangements under which we issue guarantees on behalf of certain of our unconsolidated subsidiaries 
in the event of non payment  we are obligated to make payment in accordance with the provisions of the guarantee arrangement 
as of december   amap repaid its total project debt outstanding  for which we had previously provided a several guarantee on our percent share 
repayment of our share of the total project debt outstanding consisted of million and million repaid on february  and may   respectively 
upon repayment of the project debt  our obligations under the provisions of the guarantee arrangement have been relieved 
based on our current borrowing capacity and the actions we have taken in response to the global financial crisis to conserve cash  we have adequate liquidity and expect to fund our business obligations from available cash  current operations and existing borrowing arrangements 
other sources of funding may include new lines of credit or other financing arrangements 
several credit markets may provide additional capacity should that become necessary 
the bank market may provide funding through a term loan  bridge loan  revolving credit facility  or through exercising the million accordion in our current credit facility 
the risk associated with this market is significant increases in borrowing costs as a result of limited capacity 
as in all debt markets  capacity is a global issue that impacts the bond market 
our issuance of a million public offering of year senior notes in march and a billion public offering of year and year senior notes in september provide evidence that capacity in the bond markets has improved for investment grade companies compared to conditions impacting such markets in these transactions represent the successful execution of our strategy to increase liquidity and extend debt maturities to align with longer term capital structure needs 
accessing the capital markets may provide additional sources of funding  as well as other alternative sources such as lease financing 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating leases  which are primarily utilized for certain equipment and office space 
aside from this  we do not have any other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
market risks we are subject to a variety of risks  including those caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
we have established policies and procedures to manage such risks  however  certain risks are beyond our control 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of our operations in australia  which could impact our financial condition 
foreign exchange risk arises from our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because our reporting currency is the united states dollar  but the functional currency of our asia pacific operations is the australian dollar 
our asia pacific operations receive funds in us currency for their iron ore and coal sales and incur costs in australian currency 
we use forward 
table of contents exchange contracts  call options and collar options to hedge our foreign currency exposure for a portion of our sales receipts 
the primary objective for the use of these instruments is to reduce exposure to changes in australian and us currency exchange rates and to protect against undue adverse movement in these exchange rates 
at december   we had million of outstanding exchange rate contracts with varying maturity dates ranging from february to december for which we elected hedge accounting  effective october we also had million of outstanding exchange rate contracts with varying maturity dates ranging from january to january that we have been holding as economic hedges  entered into prior to october a percent increase in the value of the australian dollar from the month end rate would increase the fair value of these contracts by approximately million  and a percent decrease would reduce the fair value by approximately million 
we may enter into additional hedging instruments in the near future as needed in order to further hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the pellets produced at our wabush operation in canada represented approximately percent of our north american iron ore pellet production as of december  this operation is subject to currency exchange fluctuations between the united states and canadian currency 
we do not currently hedge our exposure to this currency exchange fluctuation  however  we plan to enter into hedging instruments in the future to hedge such exposures 
the functional currency for wabush was determined to be the canadian dollar prior to our acquisition of the remaining interest 
at the time  we had a percent noncontrolling interest in the mining venture 
our acquisition to obtain full ownership of wabush and the resulting change in control in february triggered a reassessment of the accounting principles related to the determination of wabush s functional currency during the first quarter of as a result  effective february   we changed the functional currency of wabush from the local currency to the us dollar reporting currency primarily due to changes in the nature of intercompany transactions and changes in the structure under which the entity is financed  resulting in the us dollar becoming the currency of the primary economic environment in which the business operates 
interest rate risk interest payable on our billion  million and million senior notes is at fixed rates 
interest for borrowings under our credit facility is at a floating rate  dependent in part on the libor rate  which could expose us to the effects of interest rate changes  however  there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility as of december  pricing risks provisional pricing arrangements during the first quarter of  the world s largest iron ore producers moved away from the annual international benchmark pricing mechanism referenced in certain of our customer supply agreements  resulting in a shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market 
such changes are likely to yield increased volatility in iron ore pricing 
in addition  these changes led to extended pricing negotiations with certain customers during as a result  we recorded certain shipments made throughout the year on a provisional basis until final settlements were reached 
the pricing provisions were characterized as freestanding derivatives  which were marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period based upon the estimated forward settlement until prices were actually settled 
the fair value of the instrument was determined based on the forward price expectation of the final price settlement 
therefore  to the extent final prices were higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis  an increase or decrease to revenues was recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing 
we renegotiated the terms of our supply agreements and reached short term pricing arrangements with our asia pacific iron ore customers 
in addition  we reached final pricing settlements with some of our north american iron ore customers through the fourth quarter of for the contract year 
with respect to the north american iron ore customers for which final pricing for the contract year has not yet been settled as of december   we did not record shipments on a provisional basis due to pending arbitrations 
as a result  there are no provisionally priced derivative assets recorded at december  although pricing has been settled with some of our north american customers for  we are still in the process of assessing the impact a change to the historical annual pricing mechanism will have on certain of our larger existing north american iron ore customer supply agreements that extend over multiple years  and negotiations are still ongoing with these customers 

table of contents arbitration we are currently in discussions with certain of our customers regarding how our supply agreements will take into account the change in international market pricing 
additionally  we currently have arbitrations pending relating to the price adjustment provisions of two supply agreements  as further discussed under part ii item  legal proceedings 
these discussions and arbitrations may result in changes to the pricing mechanisms used with our various customers and could impact sales prices realized in current and future periods 
in the event that we are unsuccessful in defending our position  the retroactive revised pricing for sales under one of the supply agreements could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
the outcome and timing of the arbitrations are uncertain 
customer supply agreements certain supply agreements with one north american iron ore customer provide for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customer s average annual steel pricing at the time the product is consumed in the customer s blast furnace 
the supplemental pricing is characterized as an embedded derivative  which is finalized based on a future price  and is marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period until the pellets are consumed and the amounts are settled 
the fair value of the instrument is determined using a market approach based on an estimate of the annual realized price of hot rolled steel at the steelmaker s facilities  and takes into consideration current market conditions and nonperformance risk 
at december   we had a derivative asset of million  representing the fair value of the pricing factors  based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and an estimated average hot band steel price related to the period in which the tons are expected to be consumed in the customer s blast furnace at each respective steelmaking facility  subject to final pricing at a future date 
this compares with a derivative asset of million as of december   based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and the related estimated average hot band steel price 
we estimate that a change in the average hot band steel price realized from the december  estimated price recorded would cause the fair value of the derivative instrument to increase or decrease by approximately million  thereby impacting our consolidated revenues by the same amount 
we have not entered into any hedging programs to mitigate the risk of adverse price fluctuations  nor do we intend to hedge our exposure to such risks in the future  however  certain of our term supply agreements contain price collars  which typically limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our products during any given year 
volatile energy and fuel costs the volatile cost of energy is an important issue affecting our production costs  primarily in relation to our iron ore operations 
our consolidated north american iron ore mining ventures consumed approximately million mmbtu s of natural gas at an average delivered price of per mmbtu  and million gallons of diesel fuel at an average delivered price of per gallon in our recently acquired clcc operations consumed approximately million gallons of diesel fuel at an average delivered rate of per gallon since the date of acquisition 
consumption of diesel fuel by our asia pacific operations was approximately million gallons at an average delivered price of per gallon for the same period 
our strategy to address increasing energy rates includes improving efficiency in energy usage and utilizing the lowest cost alternative fuels 
in addition  we purchased forward contracts for projected natural gas and diesel needs related to our north american iron ore operations as a hedge against price volatility during such contracts are in quantities expected to be delivered and used in the production process 
as of december   all of our natural gas hedge contracts have matured 
we have diesel purchases for a volume of million gallons at an average price of per gallon 
this represents five percent of the total projected usage for at december   the notional amount of the outstanding diesel fuel forward contracts was million 
the contracts for mature at various times through may if the forward rates were to change percent from the month end rate  the value and potential cash flow effect on the contracts would be approximately million 
we will continue to monitor relevant energy markets for risk mitigation opportunities and may make additional forward purchases or employ other hedging instruments in the future as warranted and deemed 
table of contents appropriate by management 
assuming we do not enter into further hedging activity in the near term  a percent change in natural gas and diesel fuel prices would result in a change of approximately million in our annual fuel and energy costs base on expected consumption in supply concentration risks many of our mines are dependent on one source for electric power and for natural gas 
a significant interruption or change in service or rates from our energy suppliers could materially impact our production costs  margins and profitability 
uncertainties of health care reform legislation on march   the ppaca was signed into law 
on march   a companion bill  the reconciliation act was also signed into law 
among other things  the ppaca and the reconciliation act  when taken together  reduce the tax benefits available to an employer that receives the medicare part d subsidy 
the reconciliation act partially restores the reduction under the ppaca 
the impact of the us health care reform will be phased in between and and will likely have a significant impact on our costs of providing employee health benefits beginning in in addition  as a result of the health care reform legislation that has been passed  our results of operations have been negatively impacted by a non cash income tax charge of approximately million in the first quarter of to reflect the reduced deductibility of the postretirement prescription drug coverage 
the charge was recorded in the first quarter of based upon the period of enactment 
as with any significant government action  the provisions of the acts are still being assessed and may have additional financial accounting and reporting ramifications 
in addition  it is possible that standard setters or regulators may decide to address the accounting for the acts in the future 
the impact of any such changes on our business operations and financial statements remains uncertain 
however  as additional information becomes available  we will continue to monitor current developments and assess the potential implications of the ppaca and the reconciliation act on our business 
outlook we anticipate global steel production will continue to grow in  primarily driven by emerging economies such as china  india and brazil 
based on these dynamics  we continue to have an optimistic outlook for our businesses 
subsequent to year end  we announced we had entered into a definitive arrangement agreement with consolidated thompson to acquire all of its common shares in an all cash transaction including net debt  valued at approximately c billion  which was unanimously approved by consolidated thompson s board of directors 
in addition  we entered into a support agreement with consolidated thompson s largest shareholder  wuhan iron and steel group corporation of china  along with the directors and certain senior officers of consolidated thompson 
this transaction is expected to close in early second quarter of  subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various closing conditions 
after closing this transaction  we anticipate including this business in subsequent market outlooks 
north american iron ore outlook long tons for  we are increasing our north american iron ore sales volume expectation to approximately million tons  partially as a result of an additional  tons of sales volume that we expect to recognize in the first quarter of revenue was not recognized during the fourth quarter of for these tons due to payment timing and severe weather conditions on the great lakes 
the balance of the increase is due to improved market conditions 
our north american iron ore revenue per ton expectation is to  based on the following assumptions us blast furnace utilization of approximately percent  average hot rolled steel pricing of to  
table of contents settled annual pellet increases of percent from s pricing  and successful collection of million associated with the pending arbitration discussed above 
the revenue per ton expectation also considers various contract provisions  lag year adjustments and pricing caps and floors contained in certain supply agreements 
actual realized average revenue per ton for the full year will ultimately depend on increases or decreases for blast furnace pellets from annual seaborne pellet prices  sales volume levels  customer mix  production input costs and or steel prices all factors in our formula based pricing in the north american iron ore business segment and the final award for the on going arbitration 
in addition  the following approximate sensitivities could impact actual realized prices for every percent change from the above expectation for annual blast furnace pellet prices  we expect our average realized revenue per ton in north american iron ore to change by approximately  and for every change from the estimated hot rolled steel prices noted above  we expect our average revenue per ton in north american iron ore to change by

recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note business summary and significant accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the respective dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
preparation of financial statements requires management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingencies 
management bases its estimates on various assumptions and historical experience  which are believed to be reasonable  however  due to the inherent nature of estimates  actual results may differ significantly due to changed conditions or assumptions 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
management believes that the following critical accounting estimates and judgments have a significant impact on our financial statements 
revenue recognition north american iron ore customer supply agreements most of our north american iron ore long term supply agreements are comprised of a base price with annual price adjustment factors  some of which are subject to annual price collars in order to limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our iron ore pellets during any given year 
the base price is the primary component of the purchase price for each contract 
the inflation indexed price adjustment factors are integral to the iron ore supply contracts and vary based on the agreement but typically include adjustments based upon changes in international pellet prices  changes in specified producers price indices including those for all commodities  industrial commodities  energy and steel 
the pricing adjustments generally operate in the same manner  with each factor typically comprising a portion of the price adjustment  although the weighting of each factor varies based upon the specific terms of each agreement 
in most cases  these adjustment factors have not been finalized at the time our product is sold 
in these cases  we have historically estimated the adjustment factors at each reporting period based upon the best third party information available 
the estimates are then adjusted to actual when the information has been finalized 
during the third quarter of  we revised our approach for estimating the adjustment factors to include published pricing settlements realized by other companies in the industry 
with respect to international pellet prices  certain long term supply agreements reference the previous year s settled price  in which case  no estimate is required 
however  pricing in some of our supply agreements is based upon the international pellet price for the current year 
the period during which we must estimate changes in international pellet prices varies year to year based on the timing of final settlement 
historically  contract negotiations were completed and pricing settlements for the upcoming year were reached during the first quarter of the contract year  in which case an estimate was required only for a short period of time and was adjusted to actual prior to reporting first quarter results 
this was the case in as a result  the price adjustment provisions related to international pellet prices were essentially a fixed component of the purchase price for that contract year based upon the timing of settlement 
several instances occurred in both and  in which 
table of contents contract negotiations were extended with settlement occurring later in the year 
information used in developing the estimate prior to settlement included such factors as previous pricing settlements among other iron ore producers and consumers in the industry  current spot prices  market trends  publications and other industry information 
however  based on the timing of settlement  adjustments of our estimate to the actual international pellet price were not material in or as a result of having limited shipments to customers with these contract provisions during the first quarter of each respective year 
in  the world s largest iron ore producers moved away from the annual international benchmark pricing mechanism referenced in certain of our customer supply agreements  resulting in a shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market 
these changes caused us to assess the impact a change to the historical annual pricing mechanism would have on certain of our larger existing north american iron ore customer supply agreements 
we reached final pricing settlements with some of our north american iron ore customers through the fourth quarter of for the contract year 
as a result  we recorded certain shipments made throughout the year on a provisional basis until final settlements were reached 
with respect to the north american iron ore customers for which final pricing for the contract year has not yet been settled as of december   we did not record shipments on a provisional basis due to pending arbitrations 
based on the timing of these settlements and the quality of our estimates  adjustments of our provisional pricing estimates were not material during the producer price indices remain a provisional component of the sales price throughout the contract year and are estimated each quarter using publicly available forecasts of such indices 
the final indices referenced in certain of the north american iron ore supply contracts are typically not published by the us department of labor until the second quarter of the subsequent year 
as a result  we record an adjustment for the difference between the fourth quarter estimate and the final price in the following year 
historically  such adjustments have not been material as they have represented less than half of percent of north american iron ore s revenue for each of the three preceding fiscal years ended december   and in addition  certain supply agreements with one customer include provisions for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customer s average annual steel pricing for the year the product is consumed in the customer s blast furnaces 
the supplemental pricing is characterized as an embedded derivative  which is finalized based on a future price  and is marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period until the pellets are consumed and the amounts are settled 
the fair value of the instrument is determined using a market approach based on an estimate of the annual realized price of hot rolled steel at the steelmaker s facilities 
at december   we had a derivative asset of million  representing the fair value of the pricing factors  based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and an estimated average hot band steel price related to the period in which the tons are expected to be consumed in the customer s blast furnace at each respective steelmaking facility  subject to final pricing at a future date 
this compares with a derivative asset of million as of december   based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and the related estimated average hot band steel price 

table of contents the customer s average annual price is not known at the time of sale and the actual price is received on a delayed basis at the end of the year  once the average annual price has been finalized 
as a result  we estimate the average price and adjust the estimate to actual in the fourth quarter when the information is provided by the customer at the end of each year 
information used in developing the estimate includes such factors as production and pricing information from the customer  current spot prices  third party analyst forecasts  publications and other industry information 
the accuracy of our estimates typically increases as the year progresses based on additional information in the market becoming available and the customer s ability to more accurately determine the average price it will realize for the year 
the following represents the historical accuracy of our pricing estimates related to the derivative as well as the impact on revenue resulting from the difference between the estimated price and the actual price for each quarter during  and prior to receiving final information from the customer for tons consumed during each year hot band steel price estimate vs 
actual final price estimated price impact on revenue in millions final price estimated price impact on revenue in millions final price estimated price impact on revenue in millions first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter we estimate that a change in the average hot band steel price realized from the december  estimated price recorded for the unconsumed tons remaining at year end would cause the fair value of the derivative instrument to increase or decrease by approximately million  thereby impacting our consolidated revenues by the same amount 
provisional pricing arrangements historically  certain supply agreements primarily with our asia pacific iron ore customers provided for revenue or refunds based on the ultimate settlement of annual international benchmark pricing for lump and fines 
as a result of the derivative accounting treatment applied to the provisions  revenue reflected the estimated benchmark price until final settlement occurred 
therefore  to the extent final prices were higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis  an increase or decrease to revenues was recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing 
accordingly  in times of rising iron ore prices  our revenues benefited from higher prices received for contracts priced at the current benchmark price and also from an increase related to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods  in times of falling iron ore prices  the opposite occurred 
pricing estimates were primarily based upon reported price settlements in the industry and worldwide pressures in the market 
as discussed above  in  the world s largest iron ore producers moved away from the annual international benchmark pricing mechanism referenced in certain of our customer supply agreements  resulting in a shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market 
as a result  we renegotiated the terms of our supply agreements with our chinese and japanese asia pacific iron ore customers moving to shorter term pricing mechanisms of various durations based on the average daily spot prices  with certain pricing mechanisms that have a duration of up to a quarter 
this change was effective in the first quarter of for our chinese customers and the second quarter of for our japanese customers 
based on timing of these changes  pricing settlements were finalized with customers during each of the quarters with the exception of the first quarter of therefore  provisional pricing estimates were used during the first quarter of to reflect an increase of percent over settled prices for both lump and fines based on provisional quarterly index pricing 
the pricing estimates for the first quarter of reflected the increase in steel demand and spot prices for iron ore and were based upon index pricing mechanisms previously reported in the industry 
in addition  sales to our japanese customers during the first quarter of reflected prices based upon contract years of april to march 
table of contents the following represents the historical accuracy of our provisional price estimates  as well as the impact on product revenues resulting from the difference between the estimated change in price and the actual change in price for the quarters during  and prior to settlement 
the derivative instrument recorded during the first quarter of was settled during the second quarter of upon the move to short term pricing arrangements with asia pacific iron ore customers 
the timing of the pricing settlements for and is described further in the table below

mineral reserves we regularly evaluate our economic mineral reserves and update them as required in accordance with sec industry guide the estimated mineral reserves could be affected by future industry conditions  geological conditions and ongoing mine planning 
maintenance of effective production capacity or the mineral reserve could require increases in capital and development expenditures 
generally as mining operations progress  haul lengths and lifts increase 
alternatively  changes in economic conditions  or the expected quality of mineral reserves could decrease capacity or mineral reserves 
technological progress could alleviate such factors  or increase capacity of mineral reserves 
we use our mineral reserve estimates combined with our estimated annual production levels  to determine the mine closure dates utilized in recording the fair value liability for asset retirement obligations 
refer to note environmental and mine closure obligations  for further information 
since the liability represents the present value of the expected future obligation  a significant change in mineral reserves or mine lives would have a substantial effect on the recorded obligation 
we also utilize economic mineral reserves for evaluating potential impairments of mine assets and in determining maximum useful lives utilized to calculate depreciation and amortization of long lived mine assets 
decreases in mineral reserves or mine lives could significantly affect these items 
asset retirement obligations and environmental remediation costs the accrued mine closure obligations for our active mining operations provide for contractual and legal obligations associated with the eventual closure of the mining operations 
our obligations are determined based on detailed estimates adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider ie  inflation  overhead and profit  which are escalated at an assumed rate of inflation to the estimated closure dates  and then discounted 
table of contents using the current credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
the estimate also incorporates incremental increases in the closure cost estimates and changes in estimates of mine lives 
the closure date for each location is determined based on the exhaustion date of the remaining iron ore reserves  which is dependent on our estimate of the economically recoverable mineral reserves 
the estimated obligations are particularly sensitive to the impact of changes in mine lives given the difference between the inflation and discount rates 
changes in the base estimates of legal and contractual closure costs due to changes in legal or contractual requirements  available technology  inflation  overhead or profit rates would also have a significant impact on the recorded obligations 
we have a formal policy for environmental protection and restoration 
our obligations for known environmental matters at active and closed mining operations and other sites have been recognized based on estimates of the cost of investigation and remediation at each site 
if the obligation can only be estimated as a range of possible amounts  with no specific amount being more likely  the minimum of the range is accrued 
management reviews its environmental remediation sites quarterly to determine if additional cost adjustments or disclosures are required 
the characteristics of environmental remediation obligations  where information concerning the nature and extent of clean up activities is not immediately available  and which are subject to changes in regulatory requirements  result in a significant risk of increase to the obligations as they mature 
expected future expenditures are not discounted to present value unless the amount and timing of the cash disbursements can be reasonably estimated 
potential insurance recoveries are not recognized until realized 
refer to note environmental and mine closure obligations  for further information 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  we consider three years of cumulative operating income loss 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets 
our losses in certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against certain of our foreign deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements requires that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on technical merits 

table of contents we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc  and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
goodwill impairment in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit must be made  including among other things  estimates related to pricing  volume and reserves 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation model 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the period such determination was made 
goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year 
we determined that the fair value of the reporting units for which goodwill has been assigned was in excess of our carrying value as of december   and that we did not have any reporting units that were at risk of failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
the fair values were substantially in excess of our carrying values for our north american iron ore  north american coal  and asia pacific iron ore reporting units 
the fair value of our ferroalloys operating unit was not substantially in excess of our carrying values due the fact that this reporting unit is primarily comprised of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed through the freewest and spider acquisitions in therefore  our carrying values for the ferroalloys operating unit were recorded at fair value through the completion of these acquisitions 
in addition to the annual impairment test required under us gaap  we assessed whether events or circumstances occurred that potentially indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
based on the assessment performed  we concluded that there were no such events or changes in circumstances during consequently  no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in refer to note business summary and significant accounting policies  for further information regarding our policy on goodwill impairment 
asset impairment in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets must be made  as well as the related estimated useful lives 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the period such determination was made 
we monitor conditions that indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may be impaired 
in order to determine if assets have been impaired  assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable  independent cash flows are available 
an impairment loss exists when projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets 
the measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets 
fair value can be determined using a market approach  income approach or cost approach 
the impairment analysis and fair value determination can result in substantially different outcomes based on critical assumptions and estimates including the quantity and quality of remaining economic ore reserves  future iron ore prices and production costs

employee retirement benefit obligations we offer defined benefit pension plans  defined contribution pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans  primarily consisting of retiree healthcare benefits  to most employees in north america as part of a total compensation and benefits program 
this includes employees of pinnoak  who became employees of the 
table of contents company through the july acquisition  and employees of clcc  who became employees of the company through the july acquisition 
upon the acquisition of the remaining percent interest in wabush in february  we fully consolidated the canadian plans into our pension and opeb obligations 
we do not have employee retirement benefit obligations at our asia pacific iron ore operations 
following is a summary of our defined benefit pension and opeb funding and expense for the years through in millions pension opeb funding expense funding expense estimated assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans primarily retiree healthcare benefits that we offer are evaluated periodically by management 
critical assumptions  such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the medical care cost trend  and the rate of compensation increase are reviewed annually 
as of december   we used the following assumptions pension and other benefits us plan discount rate canadian plan discount rate rate of compensation increase us expected return on plan assets canadian expected return on plan assets the canadian plans were not consolidated into our pension and opeb obligations prior to the acquisition of the remaining percent interest in wabush in february additionally  on december   we adopted the irs prescribed mortality tables separate pre retirement and postretirement to determine the expected life of our plan participants  replacing the irs prescribed mortality tables for our us plans 
the assumed mortality remained the same as the previous year for our canadian plans  up with full projection
