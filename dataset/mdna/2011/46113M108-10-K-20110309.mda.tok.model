general management overview history interval leisure group  inc  or ilg  was incorporated as a delaware corporation in may in connection with a plan by iac interactivecorp  or iac  to separate into five publicly traded companies  referred to as the spin off 
in connection with the spin off  we entered into an indenture pursuant to which we issued million of senior unsecured notes due and entered into a senior secured credit facility with a maturity in  including a term loan in the original principal amount of million and a million revolving credit facility 
ilg was formed to hold the membership and exchange and management and rental businesses  and commenced trading on the nasdaq stock market in august under the symbol iilg 

table of contents ilg consists of two operating segments 
during the fourth quarter of  we changed the names of our two operating segments from interval to membership and exchange and from aston to management and rental  in order to better describe the underlying business operations in the segments 
the historical segments financial information and underlying operational activity did not change  other than the addition of the operations of trading places international  or tpi  upon completion of the acquisition on november  the membership and exchange segment consists of interval international inc businesses  referred to as interval  and tpi membership and exchange related line of business 
the management and rental segment consists of aston hotels resorts  llc and maui condo and home  llc  referred to as aston  and tpi management and rental related line of business 
the businesses operated by ilg following the spin off are referred to herein as the ilg businesses 
basis of presentation the historical consolidated financial statements of ilg and its subsidiaries and the disclosure set forth in this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflect the contribution or other transfer to ilg of all of the subsidiaries and assets and the assumption by ilg of all of the liabilities relating to the ilg businesses in connection with the spin off  and the allocation to ilg of certain iac corporate expenses relating to the ilg businesses prior to the spin off 
accordingly  the historical consolidated financial statements of ilg prior to the spin off reflect the historical financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the ilg businesses since their respective dates of acquisition by iac  based on the historical consolidated financial statements and accounting records of iac and using the historical results of operations and historical basis of the assets and liabilities of the ilg businesses with the exception of accounting for income taxes 
for purposes of these financial statements  income taxes have been computed for ilg on an as if stand alone  separate tax return basis 
intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated 
in the opinion of ilg management  the assumptions underlying the historical consolidated financial statements of ilg and its subsidiaries are reasonable 
however  this financial information  prior to the spin off  does not reflect what the historical financial position  results of operations and cash flows of ilg would have been had ilg been a stand alone company during the periods presented prior to the spin off 
general description of our business ilg is a leading global provider of membership and leisure services to the vacation industry 
we operate in two business segments membership and exchange and management and rental 
our principal business segment  membership and exchange  offers travel and leisure related products and services to owners of vacation interests and others mostly through various membership programs  as well as related services to resort developer clients 
management and rental  our other business segment  provides hotel  resort and homeowners association management and vacation rental services to both vacationers and vacation property owners 
membership and exchange services interval  the principal business comprising our membership and exchange segment  has been a leader in the membership and exchange services industry since its founding in as of december   interval primary operation is the interval network  a quality global vacation ownership membership exchange network with a large and diversified base of participating resorts consisting of approximately  resorts located in over countries  including both leading independent resort developers and branded hospitality companies  and 
table of contents approximately million vacation ownership interest owners enrolled as members of the interval network 
interval typically enters into multi year contracts with developers of vacation ownership resorts  pursuant to which the resort developers agree to enroll all purchasers of vacation interests at the applicable resort as members of an interval exchange program 
in return  interval provides enrolled purchasers with the ability to exchange the use and occupancy of their vacation interest at the home resort generally for a period of one week for the right to occupy accommodations at a different resort participating in an interval exchange network 
through interval getaways  members may rent resort accommodations for a fee without relinquishing the use of their vacation interest 
in addition  interval offers sales  marketing and operational support  consulting and back office services  including reservation servicing  to certain resort developers participating in the interval network  upon their request and for additional consideration 
the membership and exchange segment earns most of its revenue from i fees paid for membership in the interval network and ii transactional and service fees paid for interval network exchanges  getaways  reservation servicing  and related transactions collectively referred to as transaction revenue 
management and rental services we also provide management and rental services to hotels as well as condominium and timeshare resorts and their homeowners associations through aston and tpi 
such vacation properties and hotels are not owned by us 
aston is based in hawaii and concentrates largely on hotel and condominium resort management primarily in hawaii  as well as vacation property rental and related services including common area and owner association management services for condominium projects 
during the fourth quarter of  we acquired tpi which provides vacation rentals and timeshare resort and homeowners association management services in the united states and mexico 
as of december   the businesses that comprise our management and rental segment provided management and rental services to over vacation properties and hotels  mostly in hawaii  as well as more limited management services to certain additional properties 
revenue from the management and rental segment is derived principally from fees for hotel  condominium resort  timeshare resort and homeowners association management and rental services 
management fees consist of a base management fee and  in some instances for hotels or condominium resorts  an incentive management fee which is generally a percentage of operating profits or improvement in operating profits 
service fee revenue is based on the services provided to owners including reservations  sales and marketing  property accounting and information technology services either internally or through third party providers 
a majority of aston hotel and condominium resort management agreements provide that owners receive either specified percentages of the revenue generated under our management or guaranteed dollar amounts 
in these cases  the operating expenses for the rental operation are paid from the revenue generated by the rentals  the owners are then paid their contractual percentages or amounts  and the management and rental segment either retains the balance if any as its management fee or makes up the deficit 
international operations international revenue decreased in compared to and decreased in compared to as a percentage of our total revenue  international revenue decreased to in  from in  and from in in october  we communicated to the employees a plan to close one of our offices in spain  which included a call center  in an effort to better align resources and reduce future operating costs 

table of contents we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter primarily related to one time termination benefits and certain professional services and administrative costs 
other factors affecting results membership and exchange the reduction in sales and marketing expenditures by resort developers spurred by the lack of receivables financing has continued  leading to a decrease in the flow of new members to our exchange networks 
during  access to credit markets returned for securitization transactions available to certain large developers and activity by regional banks working with independent developers has increased slightly 
financing standards for consumers remain higher than those required several years ago and developers are continuing to modify their business models to reduce reliance on receivables financing 
as developers with greater debt loads continue to work with their lenders  we anticipate additional bankruptcies  reorganizations and consolidation within the industry 
in addition  our fourth quarter results were negatively affected by system downtime in connection with the launch of our new proprietary membership platform as well as changes in travel patterns and inventory availability 
management and rental our management and rental segment is susceptible to variations in overall macroeconomic conditions  particularly in its predominant geographic market  hawaii 
according to the hawaii tourism authority  visitor arrivals by air in hawaii have increased and for the fourth quarter and the year ended december   respectively 
this is consistent with aston managed properties in hawaii experiencing increases in occupancy  partly related to a decrease in available room nights  leading to an overall increase of in revpar in hawaii in compared to as of february  the hawaii state department of business  economic development tourism  forecasts increases of in visitors to hawaii and in visitor expenditures in over beginning in the fourth quarter of  aston expanded beyond the hawaiian islands adding certain mainland locations 
consequently  in the first half of  the management and rental segment was adversely impacted by ramp up and seasonality related to these mainland properties 
however  for the second half of  we realized a positive contribution from the aston properties on the mainland 
business acquisition on november   we acquired tpi which offers exchange and leisure services to vacation owners  including on site management at resorts located throughout the mainland united states  hawaii  and mexico 
this acquisition expands our fee for service  asset light offerings in several areas including  direct to consumer vacation ownership exchange and specialty lodging property management 
tpi was consolidated into our financial statements as of the acquisition date and the financial effect of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  outlook throughout  we saw sustained pressures in the us and global economy related to the global economic downturn  the credit crisis  investment returns  travel health concerns and general negative consumer sentiment  all of which impacted consumer discretionary spending in travel and leisure services 
in  we continued to operate  for the most part  in a challenging business environment resulting from the carryover effects of the global economic downturn experienced in in  we anticipate the vacation ownership industry will remain in a period of transition that may result in the bankruptcy  restructuring and consolidation of developers as well as continued modifications to their business models 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates which are based on historical experience and on various other judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual outcomes could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and should be reviewed in connection with the following discussion 
set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations  based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application 
revenue recognition revenue  net of sales incentives  from membership fees from our membership and exchange segment is deferred and recognized over the terms of the applicable memberships  typically ranging from one to five years  on a straight line basis 
generally  memberships are cancelable and refundable on a pro rata basis 
direct costs of acquiring members and direct costs of sales related to deferred membership revenue are also deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the applicable memberships 
these costs relate to various commissions and initial fulfillment costs 
the recognition of previously deferred revenue and expense is based on estimates derived from an aggregation of member level data 
revenue from exchange and getaway transactions is recognized when confirmation of the transaction is provided as the earnings process is complete 
reservation servicing revenue is recognized when service is performed or on a straight line basis over the applicable service period 
all taxable revenue transactions are presented on a net of tax basis 
the management and rental segment revenue is derived principally from fees for hotel  condominium resort  timeshare resort and homeowners association management and rental services 
management fees consist of base management fees  which are either fixed amounts or range from to of adjusted gross lodging revenue  various revenue sharing arrangements with condominium owners based on stated formulas or a percentage of adjusted gross lodging revenue  and incentive management fees for certain hotels and condominium resorts which are generally a percentage of operating profits or improvement in operating profits 
service fee revenue is based on the services provided to owners including reservations  sales and marketing  property accounting and information technology services either internally or through third party providers 
service fee revenue is recognized when the service is provided 
in certain instances we arrange services which are provided directly to property owners 
transactions for these services do not impact our consolidated financial statements as they are not included in our results of operations 
additionally  in most cases  we employ on site personnel to provide services such as housekeeping  maintenance and administration to property owners and homeowner associations under our management agreements 
for such services  we recognize revenue in an amount equal to the expenses incurred 
accounting for business combinations in accordance with asc topic  business combinations  when accounting for business combinations we are required to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value as of the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets  estimated contingent consideration payments and or pre acquisition contingencies  all of which ultimately affect the fair value of goodwill established as of the acquisition 
table of contents date 
goodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit s expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date and is then subsequently tested for impairment at least annually 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired entity and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in accounting for acquisitions include but are not limited to the estimated fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration  which is performed using a probability weighted income approach based upon the forecasted achievement of post acquisition pre determined targets  the future expected cash flows from product sales and related contracts and agreements  and discount and long term growth rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of our assumptions  estimates or actual results 
additionally  any change in the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date  including changes resulting from events that occur after the acquisition date  such as changes in our estimated fair value of the targets that are expected to be achieved  will be recognized in earnings in the period of the change in estimated fair value 
recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets our policy goodwill and other intangible assets are significant components of our consolidated balance sheets 
our policies regarding the valuation of intangible assets affect the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges we may incur 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long lived assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as consumer spending habits and general economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  we review the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets of each of our reporting units on an annual basis as of october  or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances  based on a two step impairment test 
we consider our membership and exchange and management and rental segments to be individual reporting units which are also individual operating segments of ilg 
goodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit s expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date 
the first step of the impairment test compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 
the fair value of each reporting unit is calculated using the average of an income approach and a market comparison approach which utilizes similar companies as the basis for the valuation 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
the impairment loss is determined by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over amounts assigned to its net assets 
the determination of fair value utilizes an evaluation of historical and forecasted operating results and other estimates 
fair value measurements are generally determined through the use of valuation techniques that may include a discounted cash flow approach  which reflects our own assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 

table of contents during the year  we monitor the actual performance of our reporting units relative to the fair value assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test  including potential events and changes in circumstance affecting our key estimates and assumptions 
interim goodwill impairment test during the first quarter  we determined the management and rental reporting unit actual performance was negatively tracking the fair value assumptions used in our then most current annual goodwill impairment test as of october   as evidenced by notable declines in revpar relative to the prior projections 
based on this  we concluded that indicators of impairment were present and could result in a reduction in the fair value of our management and rental reporting unit below its carrying amount 
there were no indicators of impairment pertaining to our membership and exchange reporting unit 
consequently  we performed an interim impairment test for our management and rental reporting unit as of march  the first step of the two step impairment test concluded that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value by approximately 
as a result  we performed the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of any impairment loss  which concluded that the reporting unit implied fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of goodwill by a marginal amount and  therefore  no impairment loss was recorded 
the excess of the implied fair value of goodwill over its carrying value  computed in the second step  was primarily attributable to net declines in the fair value of an asset group consisting of aston property management contracts and wholesaler agreements definite lived intangible assets  certain real estate assets owned by aston and used in the purveyance of revenue generating services pursuant to the aforementioned property management contracts and wholesaler agreements  and aston tradename definite lived intangible asset 
as a result of the decline in fair value of these long lived assets  we performed a recoverability test pursuant to asc topic  property plant and equipment  asc as subsequently discussed in the recoverability of long lived assets section below 
annual impairment test as of october   we reviewed the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets of each of our reporting units 
as of october   the membership and exchange and management and rental reporting units goodwill were million and million  respectively 
we performed the first step of the impairment test on both our reporting units and concluded that each reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value and  therefore  the second step of the impairment test was not necessary 
as of december   we did not identify any triggering events which required an interim impairment test subsequent to our annual impairment test on october  key estimates and assumptions the determination of fair value utilizes an evaluation of historical and forecasted operating results and other key assumptions made by management  including discount rates  utilized in the valuation of certain identifiable assets 
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or in our results of operations or unforeseen negative events could adversely affect either of our reporting units and lead to a revision of the estimates used to calculate fair value 
these key estimates and forecasted operating results may or may not occur or may be revised by management which may require us to recognize impairment losses in the future 
with respect to our membership and exchange reporting unit step one analysis  the primary examples of key estimates include our discount rate and forecasted sales growth rates 
as previously noted  we use the average of an income approach and a market comparison approach to calculate the fair value of our reporting units 
as a measure of sensitivity on the income approach  as of the date of 
table of contents our last annual impairment test  a hypothetical change in both our discount and long term growth rates would result in a change of million in the income approach fair value of the reporting unit  or approximately of the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value 
in regards to the market comparison approach  a change in our selected ebitda multiple by would result in a change of approximately million in the membership and exchange reporting unit market comparison approach fair value  or approximately of the excess of the reporting unit fair value over its carrying value 
with respect to our management and rental reporting unit step one analysis  the primary examples of key estimates include forecasted available and occupied room nights  average daily rates and long term growth rates 
as a measure of sensitivity on the income approach  as of the date of our last annual impairment test  a hypothetical change to all four forecasted key estimates would result in a change of approximately million in our management and rental income approach fair value  or approximately of the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value 
in regards to the market comparison approach  a change in our selected ebitda multiple by would result in a change of approximately million in the reporting unit market comparison approach fair value  or approximately of the excess of the reporting unit fair value over its carrying value 
if either of these hypothetical changes occur  it is possible that the reporting unit fair value could fail to exceed its carrying value in step one of the impairment test and  consequently  we would proceed to step two of the impairment test where an impairment of goodwill could be recorded 
key estimates and assumptions for both our reporting units can be impacted by certain potential events and changes in circumstances  as follows events and trends in the vacation ownership  vacation rental and travel industries that could adversely affect consumers travel to and vacation in certain destinations and regions in which vacation rental properties are located  including events such as declines in discretionary spending levels during general economic downturns 
inclement weather and or natural disasters 
travel health concerns such as the hn influenza outbreak and other pandemics 
concerns related to terrorism  enhanced travel security measures and or geographical conflicts 
additionally  key estimates and assumptions for both our reporting units can be impacted by certain potential events and changes in circumstances specific to each reporting unit  such as membership and exchange a downturn or a further weakening of the economy may cause decreased demand for purchases of vacation ownership interests  may increase default rates among current owners and may increase refund requests from our members 
lack of available financing for vacation property developers and consumers or the potential insolvency or consolidation of developers could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our exchange network membership which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to maintain relationships and renew contractual relationships with vacation ownership developers that provide new members and supply of resort accommodations for use in exchanges or getaways 
our ability to motivate members to renew their existing memberships and or otherwise engage in transactions 

table of contents management and rental a downturn or a further weakening of the economy may cause decreased demand for vacation rentals 
the failure to maintain existing hotel  condominium resort and timeshare resort management and or rental services arrangements with vacation property owners and or insolvency of several properties managed by or marketed by the management and rental segment  particularly managed hotels 
a significant decrease in the supply of available vacation rental accommodations due to ongoing property renovations 
recoverability of long lived assets our policy we review the carrying value of all long lived assets  primarily property and equipment and definite lived intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset asset group may be impaired 
in accordance with guidance included within asc  recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset asset group to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset asset group 
an asset group is the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
when estimating future cash flows  we consider only the future cash flows that were directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset group  our own assumptions about our use of the asset group and all available evidence when estimating future cash flows  potential events and changes in circumstance affecting our key estimates and assumptions  the existing service potential of the asset asset group at the date tested 
if an asset asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset asset group exceeds its fair value 
when determining the fair value of the asset asset group  we consider the highest and best use of the assets from a market participant perspective 
the fair value measurement is generally determined through the use of independent third party appraisals or an expected present value technique  both of which may include a discounted cash flow approach  which reflects our own assumptions of what market participants would utilize to price the asset asset group 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
assets to be abandoned  or from which no further benefit is expected  are written down to zero at the time that the determination is made and the assets are removed entirely from service 
recoverability test as of march   as a consequence of the management and rental reporting unit failing step one of the two step process for testing goodwill for impairment  we performed a recoverability test on an asset group within our management and rental reporting unit 
the asset group at the time consisted of aston property management contracts and wholesaler agreements definite lived intangible assets  certain real estate assets owned by aston and used in the purveyance of revenue generating services pursuant to the aforementioned property management contracts and wholesaler agreements  and aston tradename definite lived intangible asset 
the resulting recoverability analysis concluded 
table of contents that the undiscounted estimated future cash flows of the asset group exceeded its carrying value by approximately of the asset group carrying value 
accordingly  the asset group was not considered impaired 
the measurement period used for the recoverability analysis was years  the remaining useful life of the property management contracts asset the asset group primary asset 
the fact that the asset group cash flows exceeded their carrying amounts in our recoverability test is largely because  pursuant to us gaap  this analysis utilizes an undiscounted cash flow approach 
this method differs from the manner in which the fair value of the asset group is calculated as part of our step two goodwill and other intangibles impairment analysis previously discussed 
our assumptions on key estimates utilized in the recoverability analysis related largely to aston forecasted available and occupied room nights  average daily rates and long term growth rates collectively key estimates 
we believe there is a low to moderate level of uncertainty associated with the assumptions utilized in the development of these key estimates 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the assumptions used in determining the undiscounted estimated future cash flows of the asset group  we applied a hypothetical decrease to each of the forecasted key estimates 
this hypothetical decrease would have resulted in the asset group carrying value exceeding the undiscounted estimated future cash flows by approximately 
the carrying value of consolidated long lived assets that is subject to assessment for impairment in accordance with asc is million and million at december  and  respectively 
from the date of our last recoverability test  march   through december   we did not identify any events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of a long lived asset asset group may be impaired 
useful life of the management and rental asset group additionally  as part of our recoverability analysis  we consider whether the existing service potential useful life of the assets within the management and rental asset group remain appropriate or require adjustment 
specifically  we consider the impact of the expected use of the assets and the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors  among other considerations 
for the year ended december   and as of the date of our management and rental asset group recoverability test  we concluded no adjustment was necessary 
when determining the existing service potential of the asset group  we concluded the remaining useful life of the property management contracts intangible asset ie the asset group primary asset was the appropriate remaining useful to use for the asset group 
consequently  as of march   the remaining useful life of the asset group used for the recoverability test was years 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value on date of grant and recognize the expense as compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units rsus is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock 
for certain cliff vesting awards with performance criteria  we also use anticipated future results in determining the fair value of the award 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the straight line recognition method 
we grant awards subject to graded vesting ie portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period or to cliff vesting ie all awards vest at the end of the vesting period 
any performance criteria attached to an award subject to graded vesting simply affects whether or not the award will vest 
management must make certain estimates and assumptions regarding stock awards that will ultimately vest  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we 
table of contents consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
the forfeiture rate is estimated at the grant date based on historical experience and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods for any changes to the estimated forfeiture rate from that previously estimated 
for any vesting tranche of an award  the cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized is equal to the portion of the grant date value of the award tranche that is actually vested at that date 
actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates 
as of december   ilg had approximately million of unrecognized compensation cost  net of estimated forfeitures  related to all equity based awards  which is currently expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
of the million of unrecognized compensation cost  relates to an employee class group comprised of certain key employees for which we do not expect rsus to be forfeited 
for awards in which we expect forfeitures to occur  a change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have an impact of less than  to our unrecognized compensation cost as of december  income taxes accounting for our income taxes requires significant judgment in the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions and in the calculation of our provision for income taxes 
pursuant to asc topic income taxes asc  we adopted a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate available evidence to determine if it appears more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained on an audit by a taxing authority  based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settling the uncertain tax position 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  the ultimate outcome of these tax matters may differ from our expectations 
we adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the completion of a tax audit  expiration of the applicable statute of limitations  the refinement of an estimate  and interest accruals associated with uncertain tax positions until they are resolved 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
see note  income taxes 
our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in our deferred tax assets or liabilities  the valuation of our uncertain tax positions  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof

venezuela operations we conduct business in venezuela where currency restrictions exist limiting our ability to immediately access cash through repatriations at the government official exchange rate 
these funds remain available for use within this jurisdiction and are not restricted 
during  the process of exchanging venezuelan bolivars to us dollars became increasingly challenging as the government approval process significantly slowed and became more rigorous 
due to the currency restrictions  a parallel market existed whereby entities could exchange venezuelan bolivars into us dollars through a series of market transactions at a specified  and less favorable  parallel market rate 
at december   we determined the parallel market rate was the appropriate rate to use for translating the financial statements of our venezuelan entity for purposes of consolidation based on the then current facts and circumstances of operating in venezuela 
in april  we transferred us dollar equivalent cash of million from our venezuelan entity bolivar denominated bank account in venezuela to our venezuelan entity us dollar denominated bank account in the us  utilizing the parallel market 
effective january   venezuela is considered to be highly inflationary 
under us gaap  an economy is considered to be highly inflationary when the three year cumulative rate of inflation meets or exceeds 
under the highly inflationary basis of accounting  the financial statements of our venezuelan entity are remeasured as if its functional currency were the reporting currency us dollars  with remeasurement gains and losses recognized in earnings  rather than in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income within our stockholders equity 
in may  the venezuelan government enacted reforms to its exchange regulations which increased the control that can be exerted by the central bank of venezuela bcv over currency trading and effectively halted the use of the parallel market pending additional regulations 
in june  the government introduced additional regulations under a newly regulated foreign currency exchange system the sitme controlled by the bcv 
after the enactment of the amended exchange regulations and cessation of the parallel market  the only foreign currency exchange processes legally 
table of contents available to entities operating in venezuela are the exchange of currency through venezuela commission for the administration of currency exchange cadivi at one of the two official rates for exchange or the exchange of currency through the sitme at the exchange rate specified by the bcv 
given our historical difficulties in repatriating us dollars at the government official exchange rate through cadivi and the closure in may of the parallel market  effective june we determined the exchange rate specified by the bcv to transact through the sitme the sitme rate was the most appropriate rate to use for remeasurement purposes at this time 
consequently  in june  we commenced utilizing the sitme rate which was bolivars per us dollar at the inception of the sitme and through september  the last available parallel market rate utilized prior to our conversion to the sitme rate was bolivars per us dollar 
our change to the sitme rate during june resulted in a gain on foreign currency exchange of million in that month 
this gain was partially offset by previous losses during the second quarter  and fully offset during the six month period ended june   due to the weakening parallel market rate utilized throughout prior to our change to the sitme rate 
the use of the sitme is subject to restrictions  including the requirement of domicile in venezuela and volume restrictions on an entity trading activity 
because our venezuelan entity operates in a highly inflationary economy  and given the uncertainty surrounding future bcv regulations or changes to the sitme rate  future remeasurements could increase the volatility of our results of operations 
however  since the majority of the cash is now held in us dollars  our exposure to this volatility is reduced 
additionally  during the second quarter  we restructured the operations of our venezuelan entity to address the increasing challenges of physically operating in the country 
as a result  we incurred certain immaterial restructuring and severance costs during the second and third quarters of however  we have not sold or substantially liquidated our venezuelan entity as it continues to operate 
as of december   we had million of unrealized loss in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity pertaining to our venezuelan entity until such time we sell or substantially liquidate our investment

our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
we believe this measure is useful to investors because it represents the consolidated operating results from our segments  excluding the effects of any non cash expenses 
we also believe this non gaap financial measure improves the transparency of our disclosures  provides a meaningful presentation of our results from our business operations  excluding the impact of certain items not related to our core business operations and improves the period to period comparability of results from business operations 
ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to our statement of operations of certain expenses  including non cash compensation 
we endeavor to compensate for the limitations of the non gaap measure presented by also providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items  including quantifying such items  to derive the non gaap measure 
we report ebitda as a supplemental measure to generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses  on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated 
we 
table of contents believe that investors should have access to the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results 
this non gaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap  but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results

non cash expenses that are excluded from ilg non gaap measure non cash compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants  including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions  of restricted stock  restricted stock units and stock options 
these expenses are not paid in cash  and we will include the related shares in our future calculations of diluted shares of stock outstanding 
upon vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units and the exercise of certain stock options  the awards will be settled  at our discretion  on a net basis  with us remitting the required tax withholding amount from our current funds 
goodwill and asset impairments are non cash expenses relating to adjustments to goodwill and long lived assets whereby the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the related assets  and are infrequent in nature 
amortization expense of intangibles is a non cash expense relating primarily to acquisitions 
at the time of an acquisition  the intangible assets of the acquired company  such as customer relationships  purchase agreements and resort management agreements are valued and amortized over their estimated lives 
we believe that since intangibles represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition  they were part of transaction costs 
depreciation expense is a non cash expense relating to our property and equipment and does not relate to our core business operations 
depreciation expense is recorded on a straight line basis to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated service lives

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business in certain foreign markets  primarily in the united kingdom and the european union 
our foreign currency risk primarily relates to our investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the us dollar 
this exposure is mitigated as we have generally reinvested profits in our international operations 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international businesses into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
in addition  we are exposed to foreign currency risk related to transactions and or assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency 
historically  we have not hedged currency risks 
for the year ended december   operating foreign exchange attributable to foreign currency remeasurements of operating assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency  primarily related to euro denominated value added tax liabilities  resulted in a net gain of million 
non operating foreign exchange included net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and a net gain of million for the year ended december  these net gain and losses were attributable to cash held in certain countries in currencies other than their functional currency 
this was principally driven by us dollar positions held at december  and affected by the shift in the value of the dollar primarily to the british pound  mexican peso  and colombian peso 
the venezuelan bolivar cash held impacted our foreign exchange net loss in given our change to the us dollar as the functional currency for that entity due to highly inflationary accounting  partially offset by a gain realized in june due to our change from the parallel market rate to the sitme rate for remeasurement purposes  as more fully discussed in our financial position  liquidity and capital resources section 
however  in april  we transferred the majority of the cash from our venezuelan entity bolivar denominated bank account in venezuela to our venezuelan entity us dollar denominated bank account in the us and consequently reduced the exposure going forward 
as we increase our operations in international markets we become increasingly exposed to potentially volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on us is often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our financing  operating and hedging strategies 
a hypothetical weakening strengthening in foreign exchange rates to the us dollar for the twelve months ended december  would result in an approximate change to

there have been no material quantitative changes in market risk exposures since december  interest rate risk at december   we had million outstanding under the term loan facility 
based on the amount outstanding  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate change to interest expense of million 
additionally  at december   we had million face amount of interval senior notes that bear interest at a fixed amount 
as market rates have declined  the required payments on the fixed rate debt have exceeded those based on market rates 
based on our mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt and cash balances  we do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure 
there have been no material quantitative changes in market risk exposures since december
