there could be terrorist activities or other hostilities  which may adversely affect the general economy  financial and capital markets  specific industries  and the company 
the terrorist attacks in september in the united states and ensuing events  as well as the resulting decline in consumer confidence  had a material adverse effect on the economy

executive overview cass provides payment and information processing services to large manufacturing  distribution and retail enterprises from its offices locations in st 
louis  missouri  columbus  ohio  boston  massachusetts  greenville  south carolina and wellington  kansas 
the company s services include freight invoice rating  payment processing  auditing  and the generation of accounting and transportation information 
cass also processes and pays utility invoices  which include electricity  gas and telecommunications expenses  and is a provider of telecom expense management solutions 
cass extracts  stores  and presents information from freight  utility and telecommunication invoices  assisting its customers transportation  energy  and information technology managers in making decisions that will enable them to improve operating performance 
the company receives data from multiple sources  electronic and otherwise  and processes the data to accomplish the specific operating requirements of its customers 
it then provides the data in a central repository for access and archiving 
the data is finally transformed into information through the company s databases that allow client interaction as required and provide internet based tools for analytical processing 
the company also  through cass commercial bank  its st 
louis  missouri based bank subsidiary the bank  provides banking services in the st 
louis metropolitan area  orange county  california  and other selected cities in the united states 
in addition to supporting the company s payment operations  the bank provides banking services to its target markets  which include privately owned businesses and churches and church related ministries 
the specific payment and information processing services provided to each customer are developed individually to meet each customer s requirements  which can vary greatly 
in addition  the degree of automation such as electronic data interchange  imaging  and web based solutions varies greatly among customers and industries 
these factors combine so that pricing varies greatly among the customer base 
in general  however  cass is compensated for its processing services through service fees and investment of account balances generated during the payment process 
the amount  type  and calculation of service fees vary greatly by service offering  but generally follow the volume of transactions processed 
interest income from the balances generated during the payment processing cycle is affected by the amount of time cass holds the funds prior to payment and the dollar volume processed 
both the number of transactions processed and the dollar volume processed are therefore key metrics followed by management 
other factors will also influence revenue and profitability  such as changes in the general level of interest rates  which have a significant effect on net interest income 
the funds generated by these processing activities are invested in overnight investments  investment grade securities  and loans generated by the bank 
the bank earns most of its revenue from net interest income  or the difference between the interest earned on its loans and investments and the interest paid on its deposits and other borrowings 
the bank also assesses fees on other services such as cash management services 
industry wide factors that impact the company include the willingness of large corporations to outsource key business functions such as freight  utility  and telecommunication payment and audit 
the benefits that can be achieved by outsourcing transaction processing and the management information generated by cass systems can be influenced by factors such as the competitive pressures within industries to improve profitability  the general level of transportation costs  deregulation of energy costs  and consolidation of telecommunication providers 
economic factors that impact the company include the general level of economic activity that can affect the volume and size of invoices processed  the ability to hire and retain qualified staff  and the growth and quality of the loan portfolio 
as lower levels of economic activity are encountered  such as those experienced in  the number and total dollar amount of transactions processed by the company may decline  thereby reducing fee revenue  interest income  and possibly liquidity 
conversely  improving economic conditions  such as those experienced in  will tend to increase fee revenue  interest income  and liquidity 
the general level of interest rates also has a significant effect on the revenue of the company 
as discussed in greater detail in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  a decline in the general level of interest rates can have a negative impact on net interest income 
in  total fee revenue and other income increased  or  net interest income after provision for loan losses increased  or  and total operating expenses increased  or 
these results were driven by a  or  increase in items processed and  or  increase in dollars processed 
the asset quality of the company s loans and investments as of december  appeared strong 
currently  management views cass major opportunity as the continued expansion of its payment and information processing service offerings and customer base 
management intends to accomplish this by maintaining the company s lead in applied technology  which when combined with the security and processing controls of the bank  makes cass unique in the industry 
impact of new and not yet adopted accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
this guidance requires a greater level of disaggregated information about the credit quality of financing receivables and reserves for credit losses  including increased disclosure of credit quality indicators  past due information  and modifications of financing receivables 
disclosures regarding activity during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december  adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company has prepared the consolidated financial statements in this report in accordance with the fasb accounting standards codification asc 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates have been generally accurate in the past  have been consistent and have not required any material changes 
there can be no assurances that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors and are described below 
allowance for loan losses 
the company performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan portfolio to assess overall collectability 
the level of the allowance for loan losses reflects management s estimate of the collectability of the loan portfolio 
although these estimates are based on established methodologies for determining allowance requirements  actual results can differ significantly from estimated results 
these policies affect both segments of the company 
the impact and associated risks related to these policies on the company s business operations are discussed in the provision and allowance for loan losses section of this report 
the company s estimates have been materially accurate in the past  and accordingly  the company expects to continue to utilize the present processes 
impairment of assets 
the company periodically evaluates certain long term assets such as intangible assets including goodwill  foreclosed assets and assets held for sale for impairment 
generally  these assets are initially recorded at cost  and recognition of impairment is required when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets will not be recoverable in the future 
if impairment occurs  various methods of measuring impairment may be called for depending on the circumstances and type of asset  including quoted market prices  estimates based on similar assets  and estimates based on valuation techniques such as discounted projected cash flows 
the company had no impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for fiscal years ended december   and and management does not anticipate any future impairment loss 
investment securities available for sale are measured at fair value as calculated by an independent research firm 
the market evaluation utilizes several sources which include observable inputs rather than significant unobservable inputs 
these policies affect both segments of the company and require significant management assumptions and estimates that could result in materially different results if conditions or underlying circumstances change 
income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns such as the realization of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  the company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities 
in accordance with fasb asc  income taxes  the company has unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the audit of the company s federal consolidated tax returns conducted by the internal revenue service for fiscal years and resulted in no significant material adjustments 
pension plans 
the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension plans are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled at december   rate of increase in future compensation levels and mortality rates 
these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
there have been no significant changes in the company s long term rate of return assumptions for the past three fiscal years ended december and management believes they are not reasonably likely to change in the future 
pursuant to fasb asc  compensation retirement benefits  the company has recognized the funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plan in its consolidated balance sheet and has recognized changes in that funded status through comprehensive income 
the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation as of the date of its fiscal year end

the loan portfolio was  and represented of the company total assets as of december  and generated  in revenue during the year then ended 
the company had no sub prime mortgage loans or residential development loans in its portfolio for any of the years presented 
the following tables show the composition of the loan portfolio at the end of the periods indicated and remaining maturities for loans as of december  loans by type december  in thousands commercial and industrial real estate commercial and church mortgage construction industrial revenue bonds other total loans loans by maturity at december  one year or less over year through years over years in thousands fixed rate floating rate fixed rate floating rate fixed rate floating rate total commercial and industrial real estate commercial and church mortgage construction industrial revenue bonds other total loans loans have been classified as having floating interest rates if the rate specified in the loan varies with the prime commercial rate of interest 
note due to the historically low interest rates encountered during and continuing during and  the company instituted a floor for its prime lending rate 
the company has no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans  which are not otherwise disclosed in the loan portfolio composition table and as are discussed in item  note of this report 
as can be seen in the loan composition table above and as are discussed in item  note the company primary market niche for banking services is privately held businesses and churches and church related ministries 
loans to commercial entities are generally secured by the business assets of the borrower  including accounts receivable  inventory  machinery and equipment  and the real estate from which the borrower operates 
operating lines of credit to these companies generally are secured by accounts receivable and inventory  with specific percentages of each determined on a customer by customer basis based on various factors including the type of business 
intermediate term credit for machinery and equipment is generally provided at some percentage of the value of the equipment purchased  depending on the type of machinery or equipment purchased by the entity 
loans secured exclusively by real estate to businesses and churches are generally made with a maximum loan to value ratio  depending upon the company estimate of the resale value and ability of the property to generate cash 
the company loan policy requires an independent appraisal for all loans over  secured by real estate 
company management monitors the local economy in an attempt to determine whether it has had a significant deteriorating effect on such real estate loans 
when problems are identified  appraised values are updated on a continual basis  either internally or through an updated external appraisal 
loan portfolio changes from december  to december  total loans increased  or  to  this increase was the result of the continued successful marketing efforts by the company s lending staff  particularly in the commercial and industrial loan sector 
the growth in real estate mortgage loans was primarily due to increased activity in the church portfolio as was the case in additional details regarding the types and maturities of loans in the loan portfolio are contained in the tables above and in item  note loan portfolio changes from december  to december  total loans increased  or  to  this increase was the result of two primary factors the continued successful implementation of new marketing efforts by the company s lending staff and the negative impact of the credit crisis on many of the company s competitors resulted in more attractive loan growth opportunities 
the growth in real estate construction loans was primarily due to increased activity in the church portfolio as was the case in at year end  church and church related real estate and construction loans totaled  which represents a increase over additional details regarding the types and maturities of loans in the loan portfolio are contained in the tables above and in item  note provision and allowance for loan losses the company recorded a provision for loan losses of  in   in  and  in the amount of the provisions for loan losses was derived from the company s quarterly analysis of the allowance for loan losses 
the amount of the provision will fluctuate as determined by these quarterly analyses 
the increase in provision for loan losses in was the result of the recent growth in the loan portfolio and the negative effect the protracted difficult economic conditions have had on both borrowers cash flow and collateral values 
the company had net loan charge offs of   and  in  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses was  at december  compared to  at december  and  at december  the year end allowance represented of outstanding loans  compared to at year end and at year end the increase in the allowance for loan losses at december  is the direct result of the increase in the provision for loan losses described above 
from december  to december   the level of nonperforming loans decreased  from  to  which represents 
of outstanding loans 
nonperforming loans are more fully explained in the section entitled nonperforming assets 
the allowance for loan losses has been established and is maintained to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio 
an ongoing assessment of risk of loss is performed to determine if the current balance of the allowance is adequate to cover probable losses in the portfolio 
charges or credits are made to expense to cover any deficiency or reduce any excess  as required 
the current methodology employed to determine the appropriate allowance consists of two components  specific and general 
the company develops specific allowances on commercial  commercial real estate  and construction loans based on individual review of these loans and an estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and collection options available 
the general component relates to all other loans  which are evaluated based on loan grade 
the loan grade assigned to each loan is typically evaluated on an annual basis  unless circumstances require interim evaluation 
the company assigns an allowance amount consistent with each loan rating category 
the allowance amount is based on derived loss experience over prescribed periods 
in addition to the amounts derived from the loan grades  a portion is added to the general allowance to take into account other factors including national and local economic conditions  downturns in specific industries including loss in collateral value  trends in credit quality at the company and the banking industry  and trends in risk rating changes 
as part of their examination process  federal and state agencies review the company methodology for maintaining the allowance for loan losses and the related balance 
these agencies may require the company to increase the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments and interpretations about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the following schedule summarizes activity in the allowance for loan losses and the allocation of the allowance to the company s loan categories 
during  the allocations to the commercial and real estate mortgage portfolios increased primarily due to the increases of  and  respectively  in additional loan balances

nonperforming assets it is the policy of the company to continually monitor its loan portfolio and to discontinue the accrual of interest on any loan on which payment of principal or interest in a timely manner in the normal course of business  is doubtful 
subsequent payments received on such loans are applied to principal if there is any reasonable doubt as to the collectability of such principal  otherwise  these receipts are recorded as interest income 
interest on nonaccrual and renegotiated loans  which would have been recorded under the original terms of the loans  was approximately  for the year ended december  of this amount  approximately  was actually recorded as interest income on such loans

therefore  the size  asset allocation and maturity distribution of the investment portfolio will vary over time depending on management s assessment of current and future interest rates  changes in loan demand  changes in the company s sources of funds and the economic outlook 
during this period  the size of the investment portfolio increased as the company purchased state and political subdivision securities 
these securities all had aa or better credit ratings and maturities approaching ten years 
with the additional liquidity provided by the increase in deposits and accounts and drafts payable  the company made these purchases to continue to reduce the level of short term rate sensitive assets 
all purchases were made in accordance with the company s investment policy

due to the company s payment processing cycle  average balances are much more indicative of the underlying activity than period end balances since point in time comparisons can be misleading if the comparison dates fall on different days of the week 
the composition of average deposits and the average rates paid on those deposits is represented in the table entitled distribution of assets  liabilities and shareholders equity  interest rate and interest differential which is included earlier in this discussion 
the company does not have any significant deposits from foreign depositors 
in response to the financial crisis  in october  the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was signed into law 
in addition  the us treasury department announced that it had been authorized to purchase equity stakes in participating us financial institutions 
under this program  known as the troubled asset relief program capital purchase program the tarp capital purchase program  the us treasury department made capital available to participating us financial institutions in exchange for  generally  preferred stock 
further  after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the fdic and the frb  the us treasury department signed the systemic risk exception to the federal deposit insurance act  enabling the fdic to temporarily provide a guarantee of the senior debt of all fdic insured institutions and their holding companies  as well as non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts under a temporary liquidity guarantee program 
after careful assessment  and due to its strong capital base  the company chose not to participate in the tarp capital purchase program 
the company elected to participate in the temporary liquidity guarantee program  as not participating could have put the company at a competitive disadvantage without the fdic guarantee of its non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts 
the fdic guarantee of senior debt was not a factor in the company s decision process  as it has no senior debt outstanding 
the cost of this program is basis points or approximately  on an annual basis based upon the additional covered deposits at december  the dodd frank act  which was signed into law on july   permanently increased the fdic insurance limit to  retroactive to january   repealed the prohibition against paying interest on demand deposits effective july    and extended the transaction account guaranty program ie  unlimited fdic insurance coverage for certain non interest bearing demand deposit accounts to december  maturities of certificates of deposits of  or more in thousands december  three months or less three to six months six to twelve months over twelve months total liquidity the discipline of liquidity management as practiced by the company seeks to ensure that funds are available to fulfill all payment obligations relating to invoices processed as they become due  meet depositor withdrawal requests and borrower credit demands while at the same time maximizing profitability 
this is accomplished by balancing changes in demand for funds with changes in supply of funds 
primary liquidity to meet demand is provided by short term liquid assets that can be converted to cash  maturing securities and the ability to obtain funds from external sources 
the company asset liability committee alco has direct oversight responsibility for the company liquidity position and profile 
management considers both on balance sheet and off balance sheet items in its evaluation of liquidity 
the balances of liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents  which include cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  federal funds sold  and money market funds  and were  at december   an increase of  or  from december  at december  these assets represented of total assets 
the company increased liquid assets during as a result of the increase in deposits and accounts and drafts payable 
cash and cash equivalents are the company s and its subsidiaries primary source of liquidity to meet future expected and unexpected loan demand  depositor withdrawals or reductions in accounts and drafts payable 
secondary sources of liquidity include the investment portfolio and borrowing lines 
total investment in debt securities available for sale at fair value was  at december   an increase of  or from december  these assets represented of total assets at december  and all were state and political subdivision securities 
of the total portfolio  mature in one year or less  mature after one year through five years and mature after five years 
the company did not sell any securities available for sale during as of december   the bank had unsecured lines of credit at correspondent banks to purchase federal funds up to a maximum of  at the following banks bank of america   us bank   wells fargo bank   pnc bank   frost national bank   jpm chase bank   and umb bank  the company had secured lines of credit with the federal home loan bank of  collateralized by commercial mortgage loans and secured federal funds of  with the federal reserve bank 
the company also had secured federal funds with no collateral with umb bank of  there were no amounts outstanding under any of the lines of credit discussed above at december  or the deposits of the company banking subsidiary have historically been stable  consisting of a sizable volume of core deposits related to customers that utilize many other commercial products of the bank 
the accounts and drafts payable generated by the company have also historically been a stable source of funds 
net cash flows provided by operating activities for the years  and were   and  respectively 
net income plus depreciation and amortization accounts for most of the operating cash provided 
net cash flows from investing and financing activities fluctuate greatly as the company actively manages its investment and loan portfolios and customer activity influences changes in deposit and accounts and drafts payable balances 
further analysis of the changes in these account balances is discussed earlier in this report 
due to the daily fluctuations in these account balances  management believes that the analysis of changes in average balances  also discussed earlier in this report  can be more indicative of underlying activity than the period end balances used in the statements of cash flows 
management anticipates that cash and cash equivalents  maturing investments  cash from operations  and borrowing lines will continue to be sufficient to fund the company s operations and capital expenditures in the company anticipates the annual capital expenditures for will be consistent with the last few years and  accordingly  should range from million to million 
as in the past  capital expenditures are expected to consist primarily of equipment and software related to its payment and information processing services business 
there are several trends and uncertainties that may impact the company s ability to generate revenues and income at the levels that it has in the past 
in addition  these trends and uncertainties may impact available liquidity 
those that could significantly impact the company include the general levels of interest rates  business activity  and energy costs as well as new business opportunities available to the company 
as a financial institution  a significant source of the company s earnings is generated from net interest income 
therefore  the prevailing interest rate environment is important to the company s performance 
a major portion of the company s funding sources are the non interest bearing accounts and drafts payable generated from its payment and information processing services 
accordingly  higher levels of interest rates will generally allow the company to earn more net interest income 
conversely  a lower interest rate environment will generally tend to depress net interest income 
the company actively manages its balance sheet in an effort to maximize net interest income as the interest rate environment changes 
this balance sheet management impacts the mix of earning assets maintained by the company at any point in time 
for example  in a low interest rate environment  short term relatively lower rate liquid investments may be reduced in favor of longer term relatively higher yielding investments and loans 
if the primary source of liquidity is reduced in a low interest rate environment  a greater reliance would be placed on secondary sources of liquidity including borrowing lines  the ability of the bank to generate deposits  and the investment portfolio to ensure overall liquidity remains at acceptable levels 
the overall level of economic activity can have a significant impact on the company s ability to generate revenues and income  as the volume and size of customer invoices processed may increase or decrease 
higher levels of economic activity  as experienced in  increased both fee income as more invoices were processed and balances of accounts and drafts payable generated as more invoices were processed from the company s transportation customers 
the relative level of energy costs can impact the company s earnings and available liquidity 
higher levels of energy costs will tend to increase transportation and utility invoice amounts resulting in a corresponding increase in accounts and drafts payable 
increases in accounts and drafts payable generate higher interest income and improve liquidity 
new business opportunities are an important component of the company s strategy to grow earnings and improve performance 
generating new customers allows the company to leverage existing systems and facilities and grow revenues faster than expenses 
during new business was added in both the information services and banking services segments 
capital resources one of management s primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital base to warrant the confidence of customers  shareholders  and bank regulatory agencies 
a strong capital base is needed to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities that arise and to provide assurance to depositors and creditors 
the company and its banking subsidiary continue to exceed all regulatory capital requirements  as evidenced by the capital ratios at december  as shown in item  note of this report 
in  cash dividends paid were 
per share for a total of  an increase of  or  compared to

the only restrictions on dividends are those dictated by regulatory capital requirements and prudent and sound banking principles 
as of december   unappropriated retained earnings of  were available at the bank for the declaration of dividends to the company without prior approval from regulatory authorities 
the company maintains a treasury stock buyback program pursuant to which the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock 
the company repurchased  shares for an aggregate purchase price of  in and shares in as of december    shares remained available for repurchase under the program 
a portion of the repurchased shares may be used for the company employee benefit plans  and the balance will be available for other general corporate purposes 
the stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations  cash requirements for investments  repayment of debt  current stock price  and other factors 
the company may repurchase shares from time to time on the open market or in private transactions  including structured transactions 
the stock repurchase program may be modified or discontinued at any time 
commitments  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company is party to activities that involve credit  market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the company s consolidated financial statements 
such activities include traditional off balance sheet credit related financial instruments and commitments under operating and capital leases 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit 
the company s maximum potential exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit  commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amounts of those instruments 
at december   no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses for these instruments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commercial and standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company or its subsidiaries to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
these off balance sheet financial instruments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
at december   the balance of loan commitments  standby and commercial letters of credit were   and  respectively 
since some of the financial instruments may expire without being drawn upon  the total amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are subject to the same underwriting standards as those financial instruments included on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary upon extension of the credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower 
collateral held varies  but is generally accounts receivable  inventory  residential or income producing commercial property or equipment 
in the event of nonperformance  the company or its subsidiaries may obtain and liquidate the collateral to recover amounts paid under its guarantees on these financial instruments 
the following table summarizes contractual cash obligations of the company related to operating lease commitments and time deposits at december  amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands total less than year years years over years operating lease commitments time deposits total during  the company contributed  to its noncontributory defined benefit pension plan 
the contribution had no significant effect on the company s overall liquidity 
in determining pension expense  the company makes several assumptions  including the discount rate and long term rate of return on assets 
these assumptions are determined at the beginning of the plan year based on interest rate levels and financial market performance 
for these assumptions were as follows assumption rate weighted average discount rate rate of increase in compensation levels expected long term rate of return on assets impact of new accounting pronouncements none 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the company faces market risk to the extent that its net interest income and its fair market value of equity are affected by changes in market interest rates 
the asset liability management discipline as applied by the company seeks to limit the volatility  to the extent possible  of both net interest income and the fair market value of equity that can result from changes in market interest rates 
this is accomplished by limiting the maturities of fixed rate investments  loans  and deposits  matching fixed rate assets and liabilities to the extent possible  and optimizing the mix of fees and net interest income 
however  as discussed below  the company asset liability position often differs significantly from most other bank holding companies with significant positive cumulative gaps shown for each time horizon presented 
this asset sensitive position is caused primarily by the operations of the company  which generate large balances of accounts and drafts payable 
these balances  which are noninterest bearing  contribute to the company s historical high net interest margin but cause the company to become susceptible to changes in interest rates  with a decreasing net interest margin and fair market value of equity in periods of declining interest rates and an increasing net interest margin and fair market value of equity in periods of rising interest rates 
the company s alco measures the company interest rate risk sensitivity on a quarterly basis to monitor and manage the variability of earnings and fair market value of equity in various interest rate environments 
the alco evaluates the company risk position to determine whether the level of exposure is significant enough to hedge a potential decline in earnings and value or whether the company can safely increase risk to enhance returns 
the alco uses gap reports  twelve month net interest income simulations  and fair market value of equity analyses as its main analytical tools to provide management with insight into the company exposure to changing interest rates 
management uses a gap report to review any significant mismatch between the re pricing points of the company s rate sensitive assets and liabilities in certain time horizons 
a negative gap indicates that more liabilities re price in that particular time frame and  if rates rise  these liabilities will re price faster than the assets 
a positive gap would indicate the opposite 
gap reports can be misleading in that they capture only the re pricing timing within the balance sheet  and fail to capture other significant risks such as basis risk and embedded options risk 
basis risk involves the potential for the spread relationship between rates to change under different rate environments and embedded options risk relates to the potential for the alteration of the level and or timing of cash flows given changes in rates 
another measurement tool used by management is net interest income simulation  which forecasts net interest income during the coming twelve months under different interest rate scenarios in order to quantify potential changes in short term accounting income 
management has set policy limits specifying acceptable levels of interest rate risk given multiple simulated rate movements 
these simulations are more informative than gap reports because they are able to capture more of the dynamics within the balance sheet  such as basis risk and embedded options risk 
a table containing simulation results as of december   from an immediate and sustained parallel change in interest rates is shown below 
while net interest income simulations do an adequate job of capturing interest rate risk to short term earnings  they do not capture risk within the current balance sheet beyond twelve months 
the company uses fair market value of equity analyses to help identify longer term risk that may reside on the current balance sheet 
the fair market value of equity is represented by the present value of all future income streams generated by the current balance sheet 
the company measures the fair market value of equity as the net present value of all asset and liability cash flows discounted at forward rates suggested by the current us treasury curve plus appropriate credit spreads 
this representation of the change in the fair market value of equity under different rate scenarios gives insight into the magnitude of risk to future earnings due to rate changes 
management has set policy limits relating to declines in the market value of equity
