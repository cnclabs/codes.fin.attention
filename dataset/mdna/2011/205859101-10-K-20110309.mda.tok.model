item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report should be read as applying to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this annual report 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those we discuss under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview comverge is a leading provider of intelligent energy management  or iem  solutions that empower utilities  commercial and industrial customers  and residential consumers to use energy in a more effective and efficient manner 
intelligent energy management solutions build upon demand response  enabling two way communication between providers and consumers  giving all customer classes the insight and control needed to optimize energy usage and meet peak demand 
beyond just reducing the energy load  this new approach reduces cost for the utility or grid operator  integrates other systems and allows for the informed decision making that will power the smart grid 
we provide our iem solutions through our two reportable segments the residential business segment and the commercial industrial  or c i  business segment 
the residential business segment sells intelligent energy management networks to utility customers for use in programs with residential and small commercial end use participants 
these solutions include intelligent hardware  our intellisource software formerly known as apollo and services  such as installation  customer acquisition marketing and program management 
if the utility customer elects to own the intelligent energy management network  we refer to the program as a turnkey program 
if we provide capacity through fully outsourced programs  where we typically own the asset  we refer to the program as a virtual peaking capacity  or vpc  program 
our vpc programs are pay for performance in that we are only paid for capacity that we provide as determined by a measurement and verification process with our customers 
the c i business segment provides intelligent energy management solutions to utilities and independent system operators that are managing programs or auctions for large c i consumers 
these solutions are delivered through the management of megawatts for these c i consumers in open markets and vpc programs as well as through the completion of energy efficiency projects 
we evaluate the megawatts of capacity that we own  manage or provide to the electric utility industry according to operating segment 
megawatts owned under long term capacity contracts or in open market programs generate recurring revenue while megawatts provided under turnkey contracts or through product sales generate revenue at the point of sale 
as of december   we owned or managed  megawatts  an increase of megawatts or from december  the following table summarizes megawatts owned  managed or provided as of december  december  residential c i total business business comverge megawatts owned under capacity contracts megawatts owned for sale in open market programs megawatts provided under turnkey contracts megawatts managed for a fee on a pay for performance basis megawatts owned or managed our vpc contract with nevada energy for megawatts of contracted capacity will not be in effect in we expect to decrease megawatts owned under long term capacity contract by these megawatts during the first quarter of 
index to form k the table below presents the activity in megawatts owned or managed during the year ended december  megawatts owned or managed as of december  capacity contracts open market programs turnkey contracts as of december  megawatts owned under capacity contracts as of december   we owned megawatts of contracted capacity from long term contracts 
our existing vpc contracts represented contracted capacity of megawatts and our energy efficiency capacity contracts represented contracted capacity of megawatts 
the table below presents the activity in megawatts of contracted capacity from long term capacity contracts

the main components of the change are an increase of megawatts in our vpc programs and megawatts in our energy efficiency programs during the year ended december  the table below presents contracted capacity  installed capacity and available capacity as of december  and  respectively 
megawatts december  december  contracted capacity installed capacity available capacity for residential vpc programs  installed capacity generally refers to the number of devices installed multiplied by the historically highest demonstrated available capacity provided per device for the applicable service territory 
for c i vpc programs  installed capacity generally refers to the megawatts that our participants have committed to shed 
available capacity represents the amount of electric capacity that we have made available to our customers during each contract year based on the results of our measurement and verification process 
for residential vpc programs  we have used the most recently settled measurement and verification results to present available capacity for each period  which is typically measured during the fourth quarter of each year 
for c i vpc programs  we have assumed that our participants will shed the committed capacity as included in installed capacity 

index to form k megawatts owned for sale in open markets as of december   we had  megawatts enrolled in open market programs  an increase of megawatts from december  we consider capacity enrolled when a participant has agreed to shed a committed capacity in an open market program in which we participate 
megawatts managed under turnkey contracts as of december   we managed megawatts under turnkey contracts  an increase of megawatts from december  the increase of megawatts consists of megawatts from an expansion of our program with pepco holdings  inc in january and megawatts from executed agreements with three other utility customers during the year 
under these agreements  we will provide a full turnkey program  including hardware  installation  customer acquisition marketing and call center services 
we calculate megawatts managed under turnkey contracts by using a pre determined factor of anticipated load reduction for each unit deployed  in relation to the type of end use participant  whether residential or commercial and industrial  and our customer s service territory 
recent developments as reported in the our quarterly report on form q for september  in the recent developments section  white rodgers had reported to the consumer protect safety commission that it was aware of incidents of battery leakage in model f thermostats sold to comverge  in which battery leakage led to an overheating of the device resulting in a fire hazard 
the corrective action plan to remedy this issue was approved by the cpsc on january  http www 
cpsc 
gov cpscpub prerel prhtml html and is currently being implemented by white rodgers and its corrective action vendor 
payments from long term contracts payments from long term contracts represent our estimate of total payments that we expect to receive under long term agreements with our customers 
the information presented below with respect to payments from long term contracts includes payments related to our vpc contracts  energy efficiency contracts  turnkey contracts and open market programs 
as of december   we estimated that our total payments to be received through were approximately million 
these estimates of payments from long term contracts are forward looking statements based on the contractual terms and conditions 
in management s view  such information was prepared on a reasonable basis  reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments  and  to management s knowledge and belief  presents the assumptions and considerations on which we base our belief that we can receive such payments 
however  this information should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results  and readers of this annual report should not place undue reliance on this information 
any differences among these assumptions  other factors and our actual experiences may result in actual payments in future periods significantly differing from management s current estimates of payments allowed under the long term contracts and our actual experiences may result in actual payments collected being significantly lower than current estimates 
see risk factors we may not receive the payments anticipated by our long term contracts and recognize revenues or the anticipated margins from our backlog  and comparisons of period to period estimates are not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of actual payments 
the information in this section is designed to summarize the financial terms of our long term contracts and is not intended to provide guidance on our future operating results  including revenue or profitability 
our estimated payments from long term contracts have been prepared by management based on the following assumptions vpc programs our existing vpc contracts as of december  represented contracted capacity of megawatts 
in calculating an estimated million of payments from our vpc contracts as of december   we have included expectations regarding build out based on our historical experience as well as future expectations of participant enrollment in each contract s service territory 
we have assumed that once our build out phase is completed  we will operate our vpc contracts at the capacity achieved during build out  which generally will be the contracted capacity 
the amount our utility customers pay to us at the end of each contract year may vary due to the results of measurement and verification tests performed each contract year based on the electric capacity that we made available to the utility during the contract year 
the payments from vpc contracts reflect our most reasonable currently available estimates and judgments regarding the capacity that we believe we will provide our utility customer 
the amount of available capacity we are able to provide  and therefore the amount of payments we receive  is dependent upon the number of participants in our vpc programs 
for purposes of estimating our payments under long term contracts  we have assumed the rate of replacement of participant terminations under our vpc contracts will remain consistent with our historical average 

index to form k energy efficiency programs our existing energy efficiency contracts as of december  represent potential remaining contracted capacity of megawatts 
in calculating the estimated million in payments from these contracts  we have included expectations for build out through contract end based on our historical experience 
we have assumed that once our build out is complete  the permanent base load reduction will remain installed and will continue to provide the installed capacity for the remainder of the contract term 
open market programs as of december   we had up to megawatts bid into various capacity open market programs with pjm interconnection  llc 
we currently expect to receive million in long term payments through the year in estimating the long term payments  we have assumed that we will have limited churn among our commercial and industrial participants that we have currently enrolled in the auctions and that we will be able to fulfill incremental capacity in certain programs with new enrollments 
turnkey programs our turnkey contracts as of december  represent million in payments expected to be received through the year with seven utility customers to provide products  software  and services  including program management  installation  and or marketing 
payments from turnkey contracts are based on contractual minimum order volumes  forecasted installations and other services applied over the term of the contract 
other contracts we expect to receive an estimated million in payments through pursuant to currently executed contracts for our intelligent energy management solutions 
in addition to the foregoing assumptions  our estimated payments from long term contracts assume that we will be able to meet on a timely basis all of our obligations under these contracts and that our customers will not terminate the contracts for convenience or other reasons 
our annual net loss in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
we may continue to generate annual net losses in the future  including through the term of our long term contracts 
see risk factors we have incurred annual net losses since our inception  and we may continue to incur annual net losses in the future 
although we currently intend to release quarterly updates of future revisions that we may make to our estimated payments from long term contracts  we do not undertake any obligation to release the results of any future revisions that we may make to these estimated payments from long term contracts to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this annual report 
backlog our backlog represents our estimate of revenues from commitments  including purchase orders and long term contracts  that we expect to recognize over the course of the next twelve months 
the inaccuracy of any of our estimates and other factors may result in actual results being significantly lower than estimated under our reported backlog 
material delays  market conditions  cancellations or payment defaults could materially affect our financial condition  results of operation and cash flow 
accordingly  a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of actual revenues 
as of december   we had contractual backlog of million through december  
index to form k results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue the following table summarizes our revenue for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  percent change segment revenue residential business commercial industrial business total in prior years  we reported the results of operations in three segments the utility products services segment  the residential business segment and the c i business segment 
for the year ended december   the utility products services segment is presented as part of the residential business segment 
accordingly  revenue of million has been reclassified for the year ended december  the results of our energy efficiency programs were previously reported in the residential business segment 
for the year ended december   the energy efficiency programs are reported as part of the c i business segment 
accordingly  revenue of million has been reclassified for the year ended december  residential business our residential business segment had revenue of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in revenue is due to an increase of million in revenue from our turnkey programs as we continued to ramp existing programs  expanded one of our programs into a new region and began operations for three new programs during the year ended december  the increase in revenue from turnkey programs was partially offset by a decrease of million in revenue from our residential vpc programs and million from our other product and service sales partially due to the impact on revenue from the white rodgers product issue as described below 
the decrease in residential vpc program revenue was due to the nv energy vpc program  which transitioned from an aggressive growth phase in to primarily maintenance of the megawatts previously deployed in we defer revenue and direct cost under our vpc contracts until such revenue can be made fixed and determinable through a measurement and verification test  generally in our fourth quarter 
in the fourth quarters of the years ended december  and  we recognized vpc contract revenue of million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   we sold  units of thermostats and digital control units compared to  units of thermostats and digital control units during the year ended december  for the year ended december   our turnkey programs comprised of total units sold compared to during the year ended december  in august  we were notified by the supplier of our thermostats  white rodgers  that white rodgers had filed with the consumer product safety commission  or cpsc  to address a product issue with the thermostats that white rodgers had shipped to comverge 
white rodgers has not conceded that the thermostats contain a defect or pose a substantial product hazard  but has nevertheless voluntarily proposed a corrective action plan to address thermostats in inventory and thermostats installed in the field 
in january  the cpsc approved the corrective action plan 
white rodgers has stated that it will cover reasonable costs associated with implementing the corrective action plan 
this corrective action by white rodgers negatively impacted revenue and operating cost in and could impact our current and fut ure utility residential demand response business  including but not limited to continued thermostat and installation sales in 
index to form k c i business our c i business segment had revenue of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in revenue is due to an increase of million in revenue from increased megawatts in open market programs across the nation  primarily the pjm capacity program 
in addition  the c i business segment had an increase of million in revenue due to increased megawatt commitments in our c i vpc programs compared to the prior year 
the increase in open market and c i vpc program revenue was partially offset by a decrease of million in the energy efficiency programs and a decrease of million in other energy engineering services 
the decrease in revenue from our energy efficiency programs is primar ily due to a decline in the number of installations we performed compared to the prior year 
for  notwithstanding a decrease in the price per megawatt for pjm  our largest customer in  we expect that growth in our other geographical markets and our c i vpc programs to result in increased revenue in our c i business segment compared to gross profit and margin the following table summarizes our gross profit and gross margin for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  gross gross gross gross profit margin profit margin segment gross profit and margin residential business commercial industrial business total in prior years  we reported the results of operations in three segments the utility products services segment  the residential business segment and the c i business segment

the increase in gross profit is due to an increase of million from our turnkey programs and million from our vpc programs partially offset by a decrease of million from our other product and service sales 
the increase in gross profit from our turnkey programs is due to the increased revenue during the year ended december  as a result of our operation of expanded and new programs 
the increase in gross profit from our vpc programs is a result of the higher gross margin provided as we fully expensed the cost of capital deployed in our nv energy vpc contract during  prior to the one year contract exte nsion 
the gross profit from other product and service sales decreased  in part  due to the decrease in sales from certain thermostat customers as a result of the white rodgers corrective action 
gross margin for our residential business segment was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   an increase of five percentage points 
the increase was due to the gross margin contributed by the residential vpc programs 
c i business gross profit for our c i business segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in gross profit is due to an increase of million in gross profit from increased megawatts in open markets across the nation  primarily the pjm capacity program 
in addition  the c i business segment had an increase of million in gross profit due to increased megawatts provided through our c i vpc programs compared to the prior year 
the increase in open market and c i vpc program revenue was partially offset by a decrease of million in the energy efficiency programs 
the decrease in gross profit from our energy efficiency programs is primarily due to a decline in the number of installations we performed compared to the prior year 

index to form k gross margin for the year ended december  increased by four percentage points compared to gross margin for the year ended december  due to the enrollment of more profitable megawatts in the pjm capacity program 
operating expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  percent change operating expenses general and administrative expenses marketing and selling expenses research and development expenses amortization of intangible assets impairment charges total not meaningful 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is due to an increase of million in compensation and benefits  million in centralization costs as we transitioned certain functions to our norcross  georgia office  million in occupancy expense as we established branch offices for our new turnkey programs  million in professional fees and million in other expenses 
these increases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by a decrease of million in non recurring charges incurred during the year ended december  we recorded million of charges comprised of million in stock based compensation and retirement and consulting expense related to the retirement of our former chairman  president and chief executive officer and million in stock based compensation related to the acceleration of non executive stock options with a strike price of or higher 
marketing and selling expenses marketing and selling expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in marketing and selling expenses is due to an increase of million in compensation and benefits partially offset by a decrease of million in marketing and advertising and million in other expenses 
in addition  we recorded a non recurring charge of million in stock based compensation related to the acceleration of non executive stock options with a strike price of or higher  during the year ended december  we expense customer acquisition costs as incurred 
vpc customer acquisition costs were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of million mainly due to our nv energy vpc program transitioning from an aggressive growth strategy to a maintenance phase 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are incurred primarily in connection with the identification  testing and development of new products and software  specifically the development of products to support utility advanced metering infrastructure  or ami 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in research and development expenses is mainly due to an increase and re deployment in headcount and an increase in contractors to develop new ami enabled hardware products and our intellisource software 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets remained consistent at million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition to the amortization presented in operating expenses  we also recorded million in amortization expense for the year ended december  in our cost of revenue compared to million for the year ended december  
index to form k impairment charges we entered into an amendment with a certain customer during the fourth quarter of that decreased committed capacity in the energy efficiency reporting unit in the c i business segment  thereby reducing future cash flows 
the decline in future cash flows impacted the fair value of the reporting unit  causing its carrying value to exceed its fair value  when we performed our impairment assessment 
the valuation for the goodwill was performed using a discounted cash flow income approach to valuing the business using a discount rate 
based on the results of the assessment  we recorded million in impairment charges in the fourth quarter of we also evaluated the energy efficiency reporting unit s intangible assets for impairment 
based on the evaluation  w e recorded million in impairment charges related to non compete agreements and contract acquisition intangible assets 
the energy efficiency reporting unit s goodwill and intangible assets were fully impaired and no further balance remains

for the year ended december   the impairment charge  net of tax benefit  per share  was 
interest expense  net we recorded net interest expense of million for year ended december  compared to net interest expense of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the decrease of million in net interest expense was mainly a result of a non recurring million charge recorded to interest expense to write off unamortized debt issuance costs related to our termination of the general electric capital corporation credit agreement during the year ended december  the remaining decrease of million in net interest expense was a result of less debt outstanding for the majority of other income  net net other income remained consistent at  for the year ended december  compared to net other income of  for the year ended december  income taxes a tax benefit of million was recorded during the year ended december  as a result of the impairment of certain intangible assets  the related deferred tax liability was removed from our consolidated balance sheet as of december   and is reflected as a tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  a provision of million was recorded during the year ended december  related to a deferred tax liability 
we provided a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets because the realization of any future tax benefits could not be sufficiently assured as of december  and year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue the following table summarizes our revenue for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  percent change segment revenue residential business commercial industrial business total in prior years  we reported the results of operations in three segments the utility products services segment  the residential business segment and the c i business segment

residential business gross profit for our residential business segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in gross profit is due to a decrease of million from our residential vpc programs partially offset by an increase of million from our turnkey programs and million from our other product and service sales 
in our vpc programs  the cost of the hardware and installing that hardware are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining term of the contract with the utility  which is shorter than the operating life of the equipment 
as previously disclosed  our nv energy vpc contract had an original expiration of january  therefore  all capital deployed in under that one vp c contract was fully expensed in resulting in a lower gross profit for that vpc contract and the residential business segment as a whole 

index to form k gross margin for our residential business segment was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   a decrease of percentage points

research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in research and development expenses is mainly due to an increase and re deployment in headcount and an increase in contractors to develop new ami enabled hardware products and our intellisource software 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in amortization expense is due to the decrease in finite lived intangible assets as a result of our impairment assessment during partially offset by the amortization of non compete agreements 
in addition to the amortization presented in operating expenses  we also recorded million in amortization expense for the year ended december  in our cost of revenue compared to million for the year ended december  impairment charges we performed our annual impairment test as of december   and the results of the test indicated no impairment 
other than our annual impairment test  no other impairment tests during the year were necessary as no events or changes in circumstances occurred during during the third quarter of  in the c i business segment  a rule change for economic demand response programs in the pjm market caused a decline in the projected operating results for the remainder of and future periods 
based on the reduction of projected operating results in current and future periods  we determined that an interim impairment test of goodwill was required 
the valuation for the goodwill was performed using a discounted cash flow income approach to valuing the business using a discount rate 
the valuation resulted in a non cash impairment of goodwill related to the c i business segment of million to reflect the carrying value in excess of the fair value 
as a part of the reorganization announced on september   we made the decision to no longer use the enerwise trade name 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to the enerwise trade name 
contemporaneous with our interim goodwill impairment test  we also performed an analysis of the potential impairment and reassessed other identified intangible assets within the c i business segment 
the impairment analysis for the customer relationships was performed using an excess earnings income approach to valuing the asset using a discount rate 
as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value to the calculated fair value 
total noncash impairment charges for the year ended december  were million 
for the year ended december   the impairment charge  net of tax benefit  per share  was 
interest expense  net we recorded net interest expense of million for year ended december  compared to net interest expense of  for the year ended december  the increase of million in net interest expense during each period was mainly a result of less investment income and increased interest expense as a result of our outstanding debt facilities as well as a million charge recorded to interest expense to write off unamortized debt issuance costs related to our termination of the general electric capital corporation credit agreement 
other income  net net other income decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to net other income of million for the year ended december  in the year ended december   we recorded a million gain on extinguishment of debt as a result of our prepayment to certain note holders at a discount of their then outstanding balance

we used these proceeds to fund our operations and to invest in our vpc programs  both in the form of capital expenditures to build out the capacity under our vpc contracts and participant acquisition expenses such as advertising and participant incentive payments  which were expensed as incurred 
in april  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock 
aggregate proceeds to us from the offering were million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and off ering expenses 
in conjunction with the completion of our initial public offering  the holder of our then only outstanding subordinated convertible debt converted million of the principal balance into  shares of common stock

in november  we entered into a security and loan agreement with silicon valley bank 
the security and loan agreement was amended in february to increase the revolver loan from million to million for borrowings to fund general working capital and other corporate purposes and issuances of letters of credit 
in november  we entered into a convertible loan agreement with partners for growth iii  lp for million to fund general working capital and other corporate purposes 
working capital as of december  was million  consisting of million in current assets and million in current liabilities 
working capital as of december  was million  consisting of million in current assets and million in current liabilities 
in addition  we had aggregate available borrowing capacity under our loan agreement of million as of december  and million as of december  management believes that working capital and borrowings available under our loan facilities will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next months 
future available sources of working capital  including cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  short term or long term financing  equity off erings or any combination of these sources  should allow us to meet our long term liquidity needs  although our ability to raise additional debt or equity cannot be assured 

index to form k cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands year ended december  operating activities investing activities financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents cash flows provided by used in operating activities cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the change in cash flows from operating activities included an increase in net loss of million  after adjusting for non cash items including depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation and impairment charges 
the remaining change of million in cash flows from operating activities was a result of the change in operating assets and liabilities  primarily an increase in accounts receivable due to increased billings in our new turnkey programs as well as timing of cash receipts and an increase in payables and accrued expenses due to the increased megawatts under contract  and th us increased participant payments  in our c i open market programs 
cash flows provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the change in cash flows from operating activities included a decrease in net loss of million  after adjusting for non cash items including depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation and impairment charges 
the remaining million change in cash flows from operating activities was a result of the change in operating assets and liabilities  primarily a decrease in accounts receivable due to the timing of cash receipts from our customers 
cash flows used in investing activities cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the decrease was due to a change in marketable securities of million as certain securities matured and we used the resulting cash to fund our operations 
we incurred less capital expenditures during the year ended december   mainly due to the nevada vpc program transitioning from aggressive growth to a maintenance phase 
cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase was due to a change in marketable securities of million as we invested a portion of the cash received from our late equity offering 
the remaining increase of million was due to increased capital expenditures as we built out our existing residential vpc programs 
our capital expenditures are mainly for purchases of equipment and installation services used to build out and expand our vpc programs 
installation services represent the installation of the demand response hardware at participants locations primarily residential 
cash flows provided by financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities were million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december   a decrease of million

during the year ended december   we received million and million in borrowings from our svb and gecc debt facilities  respectively 
we also repaid million in subordinated convertible promissory notes from our acquisitions completed in indebtedness loan agreement on february   comverge  inc and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a second amendment to its existing credit and term loan facility with silicon valley bank 
the second amendment increased the revolver loan by an additional million bringing the total revolver loan to million for borrowings to fund general working capital and other corporate purposes and issuances of letters of credit 
the second amendment also added alternative energy resources  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of comverge  as a borrower and extended the term of the revolver facility by one year to december in connection with the extension of the term of the credit facility  a commitment fee of  was paid on february   and additional commitment fees of  are payable on each of february  and february  the amended facility provides a million revolver for borrowings to fund working capital and other corporate purposes and a million term loan which was used to repay maturing convertible notes 
the term loan is no longer available for additional borrowings and our outstanding balance as of december  was million 
as of december   we had million of borrowing availability from the revolver loan 
the interest on revolving loans under the amended facility accrues at either a a rate per annum equal to the greater of the prime rate or plus the prime rate advance margin  or b a rate per annum equal to the libor advance rate plus the libor rate advance margin  as such terms are defined in the amended facility agreement 
the second amendment also sets forth certain financial ratios to be maintained by the borrowers on a consolidated basis 
on november   comverge  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries entered in a fourth amendment to its facility with svb 
the fourth amendment modified the availability provisions and financial covenants under the agreement and also modified certain definitions to reflect the subordinated convertible loan agreement with partners for growth iii  lp the obligations un der the amended facility are secured by all assets of comverge and its other borrower subsidiaries 
the revolver terminates and all amounts outstanding thereunder are due and payable in full on december   and the term loan is payable over months beginning april  and matures on december  the facility contains customary terms and conditions for credit facilities of this type  including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  transfer assets  pay dividends or make distributions on  or repurchase  our stock  consolidate or merge with other entities  or suffer a change in control 
in addition  we are required to meet certain financial covenants customary with this type of agreement  including maintaining a minimum specified tangible net worth and a minimum specified ratio of current assets to current liabilities 
the facility contains customary events of de fault  including for payment defaults  breaches of representations  breaches of affirmative or negative covenants  cross defaults to other material indebtedness  bankruptcy and failure to discharge certain judgments 
if a default occurs and is not cured within any applicable cure period or is not waived  our obligations under the facility may be accelerated 
subordinated convertible loan agreement on november   comverge  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a five year million subordinated convertible loan agreement with partners for growth iii  lp the loan is interest only  payable monthly  and accrues at a rate per annum equal to the floating prime rate plus  currently in total  as such terms are defined in the loan agreement 
the agreement contains customary events of default  including for payment defaults  breaches of representations  breaches of affirmative or negative covenants  cross defaults to other material indebtedness  bankruptcy and failure to discharge certain judgments 
if a default occurs and is not cured within any applicable cure period or is not waived  our obligations under the loan agreement may be accelerated 
the agreement also sets forth quarterly revenue targets to be maintained by the borrowers on a consolidated basis 
if the revenue targets are not maintained  the lender has the right  but not the obligation  to begin requiring quarterly repayments of the loan balance over the remaining term of the loan 
such payments would be front loaded  such that of the loan balance would be due over the first twelve month after the lender s election 
the obligations under the loan agreement are secured by all assets of comverge and its subsidiaries 
the lender may convert the note into up to  shares of comverge common stock at per share 
comverge may convert the note at the market price per share on the date of election  discounted by a certain percentage 

index to form k the loan provides  at our option  the ability to borrow up to an additional million in the first months convertible into common stock at a conversion price based upon the stock price at the time of the additional borrowing  however  at no time may the amount of existing unconverted borrowings exceed million 
in connection with the loan  a commitment fee of million was paid on november  there are no additional commitment fees 
credit agreement in january  alternative energy resources  inc  or aer  entered into a credit agreement with general electric capital corporation  or gecc  to provide aer with up to million of borrowings to fund capital expenditures related to vpc contracts 
the credit agreement had a term loan facility up to million and a letter of credit sublimit of million for total availability of million 
borrowings under the gecc credit agreement bore interest at either prime plus or libor plus per annum  at our election 
on december   we repaid million  representing all outstanding indebtedness and fees due under the credit agreement and terminated the facility 
as a result of the termination  we recognized million of interest expense during the year ended december  due to the write off of the unamortized debt issuance costs 
letters of credit after the amendment in february  our facility with silicon valley bank provides for the issuance of up to million of letters of credit 
as of december   we had million face value of irrevocable letters of credit outstanding from the facility 
additionally  we have million of cash collateralized letters of credit outstanding  which are presented as a portion of the restricted cash in our financial statements 
capital spending as of december   our vpc programs had installed capacity of megawatts 
our existing vpc contracts as of december  provided for a potential contracted capacity of megawatts 
our residential vpc programs require a significant amount of capital spending to build out our demand response networks 
we expect to incur approximately million in capital expenditures  primarily over the next three years  to continue building out our existing vpc programs  of which million is anticipated to be incurred through december  if we are successful in being awarded additional vpc contracts  we would incur additional amounts to build out these new vpc programs 
non gaap financial measures ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  is defined as net loss before net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  and depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is a non gaap financial measure and is not a substitute for other gaap financial measures such as net loss  operating loss or cash flows from operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap 
in addition  our calculation of ebitda may or may not be consistent with that of other companies 
we urge you to review the gaap financial measures included in this annual report and our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  and the other financial information contained in this annual report  and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluat e our business 
ebitda is a common alternative measure of performance used by investors  financial analysts and rating agencies to assess operating performance for companies in our industry 
depreciation is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate revenue 
we do not believe that this expense is indicative of our core operating performance because the depreciable lives of assets vary greatly depending on the maturity terms of our vpc contracts 
the clean energy sector has experienced recent trends of increased growth and new company development  which have led to significant variations among companies with respect to capital structures and cost of capital which affect interest expense 
management views interest expense as a by product of capital structure decisions and  therefore  it is not indicative of our core operating performanc e 
our internal budgets are based on ebitda  and we use ebitda as one of several criteria to determine performance based cash compensation 
we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda before stock based compensation expense and impairment charges 
management does not believe that stock based compensation is indicative of our core operating performance because the stock based compensation is fixed at the grant date  then expensed over a period of several years after the grant date  and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant date 
management believes the impairment charges related to the enerwise and energy efficiency reporting units to be not indicative of our core operating performance as these charges relate to acquisitions completed in prior periods 
a reconciliation of net loss  the most directly comparable gaap measure  to ebitda and adjusted ebitda for each of the fiscal periods indicated is as follows dollars in thousands 
index to form k year ended december  net loss depreciation and amortization interest expense income  net provision benefit for income taxes ebitda non cash stock compensation expense non cash impairment charge adjusted ebitda non gaap net loss we believe that the presentation of non gaap net loss  which is a measure that adjusts for the impact of stock based compensation expense and amortization expense for acquisition related assets  provides investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and  therefore  is useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand our operating results and underlying operational trends 
although stock based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives  stock based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant  then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock based award  and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant 
we do not acquire intangible assets on a predictable cycle 
amortization costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition  are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition  and in some cases  the remaining value of acquired intangibles and goodwill is decreased due to impairment charges 
in addition to amortization expense  we record tax expense related to tax deductible goodwill  arising from certain prior acquisitions 
these expenses generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition 
a reconciliation of net loss  the most directly comparable gaap measure  to non gaap net loss for each of the fiscal periods indicated is as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  net loss non cash stock compensation expense amortization of intangible assets from acquisition impairment charges related to acquisitions  net of tax effect change in acquisition related deferred income taxes non gaap net loss net loss per share basic and diluted non cash stock compensation expense amortization of intangible assets from acquisition impairment charges related to acquisitions change in acquisition related deferred income taxes non gaap net loss per share basic and diluted weighted average shares used in computation basic and diluted commitments and contingencies in the ordinary conduct of our business  we are subject to various investigations  lawsuits  arbitrations  claims and other legal proceedings 
although we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate resolution of any investigations  lawsuits  arbitrations  claims and other legal proceedings asserted against us  we do not believe that any currently pending legal proceeding or proceedings to which we are a party or of which any of our property is subject will have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition  except as disclosed in item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements contained in the annual report on form k 

index to form k our policy is to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters  as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of the liability required  if any  for these contingencies is made after an analysis of each known issue 
a liability is recorded and charged to operating expense when we determine that a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
additionally  we disclose contingencies for which a material loss is reasonably possible  but not probable 
as of december   there were no material contingencies requiring accrual or disclosure 
contractual obligations information regarding our known contractual obligations of the types described below as of december  is set forth in the following table dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years bank debt obligations cash interest payments on debt operating lease obligations retirement obligations warranty obligations total cash interest payments on debt as of december   million of outstanding debt was at floating interest rates 
we have assumed that the interest rate on the outstanding debt will remain relatively consistent with that as of december  in estimating cash interest payments on debt 
licensing agreement we are obligated to pay royalties to the licensor for each unit sold that incorporates a certain licensed technology under two separate licensing agreements 
during the years ended december  and  we paid million 
during the year ended december  and  we paid no royalties under the agreement 
these payments have been excluded from the table above 
guarantees we typically grant customers a limited warranty that guarantees that our products will substantially conform to current specifications for one year related to software and hardware products from the delivery date 
we also indemnify our customers from third party claims relating to the intended use of our products 
standard software license agreements contain indemnification clauses 
pursuant to these clauses  we indemnify and agree to pay any judgment or settlement relating to a claim 
we guaranteed the electrical capacity we have committed to deliver pursuant to certain long term contracts 
such guarantees may be secured by cash  letters of credit  performance bonds or third party guarantees 
performance guarantees during the year ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 

index to form k critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and our related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we re evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we belie ve to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
a summary of our critical accounting policies is set forth below 
revenue recognition residential business we sell hardware products and services directly to utilities for use and deployment by the utility 
we recognize revenue for such sales when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered and the following criteria have been met delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  collection is probable  and persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we have certain contracts which are multiple element arrangements and provide for several deliverables to the customer that may include installation services  marketing services  program management services  software  hardware and hosting services 
these contracts require no significant production  modification or customization of the software and the software is incidental to the products and services as a whole 
we evaluate each deliverable to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting 
if objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for all units of accounting in the arrangement  revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting based on relative fair values 
each unit of accounting is then accounted for under the applicable revenue recognition guidance 
we defer revenue and the associated cost of revenue related to certain long term vpc contracts until such time as the annual contract payment is fixed and determinable 
we invoice vpc customers on a monthly or quarterly basis throughout the contract year 
the vpc contracts require us to provide electric capacity through demand reduction to utility customers  and require a measurement and verification of such capacity on an annual basis in order to determine final contract consideration for a given contract year 
contract years typically begin at the end of a control season generally  at the end of a utility s summer cooling season that correlates to the end of the utility s peak demand for electricity and continue for twelve months thereafter 
once we secure a vpc contract with a utility customer  ou r residential business segment incurs significant marketing costs to identify and enroll participants in our vpc programs 
these participant acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
once a participant enrolls in one of our vpc programs  we install a digital control unit or thermostat at the participant s location 
the cost of the installation and the hardware are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining term of the contract with the utility  which is shorter than the operating life of the equipment 
the depreciation is recognized contemporaneously with revenue 
revenue recognition c i business we enter into agreements to provide demand response services 
the demand response programs require us to provide electric capacity through demand reduction to utility end customers when the utility or independent system operator calls a demand response event to curtail electrical usage 
demand response revenue is earned based on our ability to deliver capacity 
in order to provide capacity  we manage a portfolio of commercial and industrial end users electric loads 
capacity amounts are verified through the results of an actual demand response event or a customer initiated demand response test 
we recognize revenue and associated cost of revenue in demand response services at such time as the capacity amount is fixed and determinable 
we record revenue from capacity programs with independent system operators 
the capacity year for our primary capacity program spans from june st to may st annually 
for participation  we receive cash payments on a monthly basis in the capacity year 
participation in the capacity program requires us to respond to requests from the system operator to curtail energy usage during the mandatory performance period of june through september  which is the peak demand season 
the annual payments for a capacity year are recognized at the end of the mandatory performance period  once the revenue is fixed and determinable 
we enter into agreements to provide base load capacity through energy efficiency projects 
energy efficiency revenue is earned based on our ability to achieve committed capacity through load reduction 
in order to provide capacity  we deliver and install demand side management measures 
the base load capacity contracts require us to provide electric capacity to utility customers  and include a measurement and verification of such capacity in order to determine contract consideration 
we defer revenue and associated cost of revenue in our electric load reduction services until such time as the capacity amount  and therefore the related revenue  is fixed and determinable 
once the capacity amount has been verified  the revenue is recognized 
if the revenue is subject to penalty  refund or an ongoing obligation  the revenue is deferred un til the contingency is resolved and or we have met our performance obligation 
certain contracts contain multiple deliverables  or elements  which require us to assess whether the different elements qualify for separate accounting 
the separate deliverables in these arrangements meet the separation criteria 
accordingly  revenue is recognized for each element by applying the residual method  since there is objective evidence of fair value of only the undelivered item 
the amount allocated to the delivered item is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of the additional element 

index to form k revenue from time and materials service contracts and other services are recognized as services are provided 
revenue from certain fixed price contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion basis  which involves the use of estimates 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure the progress towards completion  revenue is recognized when the project is completed or when final acceptance is received from the customer 
we also enter into agreements to provide hosting services that allow customers to monitor and analyze their electrical usage 
revenue from hosting contracts is recognized as the services are provided  generally on a recurring monthly basis 
goodwill and intangibles  net goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identified intangible assets of businesses acquired in purchase transactions 
goodwill is not being amortized 
intangibles are recorded at their fair value at acquisition date 
we amortize finite lived intangibles over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method  which approximates the projected utility of such assets based upon the information available 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis  on december of each year  as well as on an as needed basis determined by events or changes in circumstances 
goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
goodwill was tested for impairment using the two step approach 
step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not required 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
we entered into an amendment with a certain customer during the fourth quarter of that decreased committed capacity in the energy efficiency reporting unit in the c i business segment  thereby reducing future cash flows 
the decline in cash flows impacted the fair value of the reporting unit  causing its carrying value to exceed its fair value  when we performed our impairment assessment 
based on this evaluation  we recorded impairment charges 
see results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  impairment charges for a complete discussion on the methodology and assumptions applied 
the results of the annual impairment test indicated no additional impairment as of december  we performed our annual impairment test as of december  and the results of the tests performed indicated no impairment 
an impairment test of goodwill and certain intangible assets was performed during the third quarter of the interim impairment assessment was triggered by a rule change in a certain market effected in that reduced the price we receive under our economic  or voluntary  demand response programs for commercial and industrial consumers in the pjm service territory 
based on this evaluation  we recorded impairment charges 
see results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  impairment charges for a complete discussion on the methodology and assumptions applied 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be assessed by comparing their carrying value to the undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows expected to be derived from such assets 
if such evaluation indicates a potential impairment  a discounted cash flow analysis is used to measure fair value in determining the amount of these assets that should be written off 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense recognized for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively  before income taxes 
for awards with service conditions and graded vesting  a one time election was made to recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
for options with performance and or service conditions only  we utilized the black scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value of options issued 
for restricted stock awards with service conditions  we utilized the intrinsic value method 
for awards with market conditions  we utilized a lattice model to estimate the award fair value and the derived service period 
determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment including estimates for the risk free interest rate  volatility  annual forfeiture rate  and expected term 
performance based unvested awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company or personal performance goals 
if any of these assumptions differ significantly from actual  stock based compensation expense could be impacted 
we will recognize million of additional expense related to unvested awards as of december  over a weighted average period of years 

index to form k on november   our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of  time based stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than for certain of its employees 
restricted stock  stock options with vesting based on performance  and stock options held by executive officers and directors were not accelerated 
as a result of the acceleration  an aggregate of  unvested stock options with exercise prices ranging from to became immediately exercisable 
the weighted average exercise price of the options that were accelerated was approximately 
the accelerated options would have vested from time to time through february  all other terms and conditions applicable to the accelerated stock option grants  including the exe rcise price  number of shares  and term  remain unchanged 
the incremental non cash stock based compensation expense recognized in the fourth quarter of as a result of the acceleration was million 
mr 
robert m 
chiste retired from the company as chairman of the board of directors  president and chief executive officer  effective june   and resigned from the company s board  effective june  in connection with his retirement  mr 
chiste and the company entered into a retirement agreement dated july   pursuant to which  related to equity awards  all unvested options held by mr 
chiste as of june  vest and became exercisable in full and remain exercisable for the lesser of their remaining terms or until march  and all restricted stock grants and any other equity based awards held by mr 
chiste as of june  vest and became exercisable in full 
as a result  the company recorded an expense of million in non cash stock based compensation expense during the third quarter of recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued amendments to the accounting and disclosure for revenue recognition 
these amendments  effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted  modify the criteria for recognizing revenue in multiple element arrangements and the scope of what constitutes a non software deliverable 
our management is currently assessing the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
fair value measurements and disclosures improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
the guidance requires previous fair value hierarchy disclosures to be further disaggregated by class of assets and liabilities 
a class is often a subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in the statement of financial position 
in addition  significant transfers between levels and of the fair value hierarchy are required to be disclosed 
these additional requirements became effective january  for quarterly and annual reporting 
the guidance did not have an impact on the consolidated financial results as this guidance relates only to additional disclosu res 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
subsequent events amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements 
the update removes the requirement to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
the update is effective for interim or annual periods ending after june  the guidance did not have an impact on the consolidated financial results as this guidance relates only to disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk we face minimal exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we do not utilize any foreign currency exchange transactions to hedge our exposure 
foreign currency gains for the years ended december   and were immaterial 
interest rate risk as of december   million of outstanding debt was at floating interest rates 
based on outstanding floating rate debt of million as of december   an increase of in the prime rate would result in an increase in our interest expense of approximately million per year 
market value of portfolio investments we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
as of december   we had million of investments in money market funds  commercial paper and corporate debentures bonds recorded at fair value on our balance sheet 
while our investments are made in highly rated securities and in compliance with our investment policy  these investments are exposed to fluctuations in market values and could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations
