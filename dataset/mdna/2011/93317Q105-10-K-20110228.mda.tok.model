item management discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk organization walter energy  inc walter is a leading us producer and exporter of premium hard coking coal for the global steel industry through our underground mining segment  operates surface mines for the steam coal and industrial coal markets through our surface mining segment and produces metallurgical coke through our walter coke segment 
in december  we announced the closure of our homebuilding segment and on april   we spun off our financing segment  creating walter investment management corp  a publicly traded real estate investment trust 
as a result of the closure and spin off  amounts previously reported in those segments are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
see further discussion in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
unless otherwise noted  this management discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition addresses our continuing operations only 
executive discussion overall  we were very pleased with our performance in earnings increased in by approximately as compared to  reflecting strong pricing and production growth from our organic growth initiatives 
our key accomplishments in include we had income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  on revenues of billion  primarily from record revenue and operating income from our underground mining segment 
our ebitda totaled million in compared to million in  an increase of 
we kept our business focused on operating as safely and efficiently as possible  highlighted by a reduction in the accident incident rate at our underground mines 
we achieved record coking coal sales of million tons as sales volumes increased in  while production increased year over year 
our surface mining segment increased year over year sales volumes 
walter coke achieved its second highest operating income ever of million 
we acquired the assets of highmount exploration and production alabama  llc highmount for a cash payment of approximately million  which has significantly boosted our natural gas production  but more importantly  will also help ensure that future coal production areas will be properly degasified  enhancing the safety and operational efficiency of existing and future underground coking coal production in this area 
we leased mineral rights for an additional million tons of coking coal reserves in an area near our existing underground mines 
we acquired the mobile river terminal at the port of mobile  ensuring we have adequate future export capacity at a competitive cost for our alabama coking coal production 
in april  we increased the cash dividend on our common stock from per share to per share 
we paid cash dividends on common stock totaling million or per share during we repurchased million shares of common stock for million 
reconciliation of net income to ebitda in thousands years ended december  net income add loss from discontinued operations add income tax expense add interest expense less interest income add depreciation and depletion expense earnings from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  and depreciation and depletion ebitda a a ebitda represents earnings from continuing operations before interest expense  interest income  income taxes  and depreciation and depletion expense 
ebitda is a financial measure which is not calculated in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should be considered supplemental to and not as a substitute or superior to financial measures calculated in conformity with gaap 
we believe that ebitda is a useful measure as some investors and analysts use ebitda to compare us against other companies and to help analyze our ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations and capital expenditure needs 
ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities 
pending acquisition of western coal in november we entered into a share purchase agreement the share purchase agreement with various funds advised by audley capital to purchase approximately million common shares or approximately of the outstanding common shares of western coal corp 
western coal for cad per share 
on december  we entered into an arrangement agreement the arrangement agreement with western coal collectively the share purchase agreement and the arrangement agreement  the acquisition to acquire all of the remaining outstanding common shares of western coal for  at the holder election  cad per share in cash or of a walter energy share  or for a combination thereof  all subject to proration  if the total cash elections exceed of the aggregate transaction consideration to be paid or the total share elections exceed of the aggregate transaction consideration 
the transaction will be implemented by way of a court approved plan of arrangement under british columbia law 
the arrangement agreement has been unanimously approved by both companies boards of directors and is expected to be completed on or about april  completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  including canadian court approvals  western coal shareholder approval  and the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals 
in conjunction with the acquisition  we expect that we will transfer approximately billion to western coal shareholders comprised of approximately billion in cash and million shares of our common stock 
the common stock consideration is valued at approximately billion using our closing share price as of january  of 
the acquisition will be funded through a combination of debt  common stock and cash on hand 
prior to the closing of the acquisition  we anticipate entering into a new billion credit agreement 
as of the closing of the acquisition  we expect to have approximately billion of indebtedness outstanding under the new credit agreement 
in january  as part of the share purchase agreement  we purchased approximately million common shares of western coal  or of the outstanding shares  from funds advised by audley capital for cad per share or approximately billion in cash  thereby reducing the amount of cash to be paid to the remaining western coal shareholders to approximately billion 
under the terms of the share purchase agreement  we will purchase the remaining million shares from funds advised by audley capital upon the earlier of the completion of the acquisition of the common stock of western coal or april  western coal is a producer of high quality metallurgical coal from mines in northeast british columbia canada  high quality metallurgical coal and compliant thermal coal from mines located in west virginia us  and high quality anthracite coal in south wales uk 
western coal produced million short tons of coal in the first nine months of their fiscal year ending march  western coal is headquartered in vancouver  bc  canada 
the acquisition will create the leading  publicly traded pure play metallurgical coal producer in the world with strategic access to high growth steel producing countries in both the atlantic and pacific basins 
long term  the combined company expects to have more than million tons of annual coal production 
we would have significant reserves available for future production  the majority of which is high demand hard coking coal  with a diverse geographical footprint and operations in the us  canada and the united kingdom 
for a discussion of the risks relating to the arrangement agreement  see item a 
risk factors risk factors relating to the arrangement agreement with western 
pending chevron coal lease and mine acquisition in april  we signed a non binding letter of intent to lease mineral rights associated with approximately million tons of blue creek coal reserves from chevron mining  inc  a subsidiary of chevron corporation 
the non binding letter of intent also included the separate acquisition of the existing north river steam coal mine in fayette county and tuscaloosa county  alabama  which has approximately million tons of reserves remaining with expected annual production of approximately million to million tons  all of which is under contract 
negotiations are continuing 
blue creek coal reserves expansion plan we continue to make progress on our plan to acquire and develop approximately million tons of blue creek coal reserves to the northwest of our existing mines  which would more than double our current coking coal reserve base in alabama 
these additional reserves include the approximately million tons of chevron mining  inc coal reserves as well as the lease for million tons of coal reserves signed in  both discussed above 
industry overview and outlook global steel production set a new record in  with world crude steel production up to more than billion metric tons  an increase of as compared to global steel utilization was for  up slightly from in our key markets of south america and europe  steel production in both regions experienced significant gains 
production in south america totaled nearly million tons  up for the year while steel production in europe increased compared to to more than million tons 
australian flooding continues into and reports suggest that the problems there have surpassed levels 
in  flooding led to the loss of more than million metric tons of coal supply into the market  causing prices to spike to more than per metric ton 
elsewhere  several russian and canadian producers have experienced labor and transportation issues  further constraining supply 
additionally  most us suppliers are already committed in their respective export markets 
as a result  we believe that supply demand imbalance will continue in our favor as supplies of coking coal  particularly high quality coking coal  remain scarce 
with improved economic growth in the asian markets and strengthened outlooks for contract prices  industry reports are suggesting benchmark prices will average in excess of per ton for we re looking forward to and plan to use our strong financial performance and the announced acquisition of western coal as a platform to continue creating value for our shareholders 
driven by the strong pricing  and despite some production issues  we remain confident that will be a record year for us  with record revenues and earnings from our underground mining segment  as we continue to execute on our alabama expansion initiatives to drive growth 
this strong market environment emphasizes walter investment considerations and growth prospects the acquisition of western coal  expected to be completed on or about april   will make walter the leading  publicly traded pure play coking coal producer in the world 
in addition  the combination increases the size  scale and diversity of our operations  significantly enhancing our financial profile and geographic reach  particularly into asia 
our coking coal product is among the highest quality in the world 
our low and mid vol coals possess the chemical and physical characteristics  including high coke strength and good fluidity  that steel producers prefer 
we believe that demand for high quality  hard coking coals  will continue to increase and that these raw materials will continue to grow in scarcity  particularly for the highest grade coals  such as ours

cost of sales  exclusive of depreciation and depletion  increased million to million in as compared to  primarily as a result of increased volumes in all our operating segments along with higher freight and royalty costs in our underground mining segment  higher production costs at our surface mining segment  and higher raw material costs at our walter coke segment 
cost of sales represented of sales in versus of this reduction of cost of sales as a percentage of sales is primarily the result of increased selling prices 
depreciation and depletion expense in increased million as compared to the increase was primarily due to higher depreciation and depletion in our underground mining segment resulting from a change to the unit of production method of depletion on certain gas properties  as well as depreciation and depletion related to the highmount acquisition and from capital expenditures to develop our mine no

additionally  the impact of percentage depletion resulted in a significantly larger favorable impact on the full year tax rate in compared to the tax rate 
outlook for our operating segments in addition to the general overview discussions above  the following discussion provides specific operating and forward looking information regarding each of our operating segments 
underground mining approximately million tons of coking coal were sold in at an average selling price of per short ton as compared to million tons at an average price of per short ton in due to a loss of production through mid february in  we estimate that coking coal sales volumes will be at most million tons in of this amount  up to  tons are expected to result from purchased coal opportunities 
our previous expectation for sales volumes was between to million tons 
however  with benchmark pricing increasing significantly in early  we expect pricing gains to more than offset the lower production 
coking coal pricing for the first quarter of is expected to average approximately per metric ton fob port approximately per short ton fob port  which includes a mix of carryover tons at per metric ton as well as new contract tons for the first quarter at or above the per metric ton benchmark price 
the average realized selling price will also be affected by lower priced purchased coal 
most of our coking coal volumes are committed for however  nearly our entire second half of the year contract sales volume is currently unpriced  leaving us well positioned to benefit from what we expect to be a strong price environment 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold million short tons  at an operating income of per ton 
fourth quarter sales volumes were at the low end of our previously issued guidance due to a longer than expected longwall move in december and difficult mining conditions at both of our underground mines late in the quarter 
these mining conditions continued into february and  along with the impact of two planned first quarter longwall moves  we expect first quarter sales volumes to be in the range of to million tons 
our forecasted first quarter operating income per ton ranges from to the coal bed methane business sold billion cubic feet of natural gas at an average hedged price of per thousand cubic feet in versus billion cubic feet at an average hedged price of per thousand cubic feet in our results include production and sales from the recently acquired highmount natural gas operation 
we expect to sell approximately billion cubic feet of natural gas in surface mining during  our surface mining operations produced and sold approximately million tons of steam  industrial and metallurgical coal  as compared to million tons produced and million tons sold during the increased production and sales volumes primarily resulted from coal blending opportunities  inventory availability and additional tons produced at our reid school metallurgical coal mine  which opened in may we expect surface mining to produce and sell between and million tons in walter coke walter coke sold  tons of metallurgical coke at an average selling price of per ton in as compared to  tons at an average price of per ton in pricing and sales volume improvements were primarily the result of demand from improved domestic automotive and steel markets 
we expect production to be between  and  tons 
the current and prior year period results also include the impact of the factors discussed in the following segment analysis 
segment analysis underground mining underground mining  which includes the operations of jim walter resources  blue creek coal sales and walter black warrior basin  reported revenues of billion for  an increase of million from the same period in the increase in revenues was primarily due to significantly higher average selling prices and higher volumes of coking coal sales during as compared to as shown in the table below for the years ended december  average coal selling price per short ton tons of coal sold in thousands average hedged natural gas selling price per mcf billion cubic feet of natural gas sold number of producing natural gas wells includes sales of both coking coal produced and purchased coal 
includes  wells associated with the acquisition of highmount in underground mining reported operating income of million in as compared to million in the million increase in operating income was almost entirely due to the increase in revenue as noted above  partially offset by higher cost of sales and depreciation and depletion 
cost of sales  exclusive of depreciation and depletion  increased as a result of higher sales volumes and higher freight and royalty costs 
depreciation and depletion increased as a result of implementing the unit of production method of accounting for depletion of certain gas properties during  as well as depreciation and depletion related to the highmount acquisition and the no 
east mine expansion 
surface mining surface mining  which includes the operations of tuscaloosa resources  inc tri  taft and walter minerals  reported revenues of million in  an increase of million from the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes and average selling prices of coal sold during as compared to the increase in sales volumes was primarily due to coal blending opportunities  inventory availability and additional tons produced at our reid school metallurgical coal mine opened in may statistics for surface mining are presented in the following table for the years ended december  average coal selling price per short ton tons of coal sold in thousands surface mining reported operating income of million in versus million in although revenues increased by million  operating income was essentially unchanged  primarily attributable to higher costs because of mining ratios and difficult geologic conditions experienced during the second half of as well as million in repair work on the dragline at taft choctaw mine completed during the second quarter of walter coke walter coke revenues were million in  an increase of million as compared to  reflecting increased customer demand in the domestic automotive and steel markets resulting in increases in both volumes and average selling prices 
statistics for walter coke are presented in the following table for the years ended december  metallurgical coke average selling price per short ton metallurgical coke tons sold in thousands walter coke operating income was million in as compared to an operating loss of million in the same period in  an increase of million 
this increase in operating income was primarily the result of higher sales volumes and pricing  partially offset by increased raw material costs

metallurgical coke pricing and volumes were down in primarily due to weak demand in the domestic steel market 
the decrease in coking coal sales volumes was due to lower sales of purchased coal 
cost of sales  exclusive of depreciation and depletion  decreased million in compared to cost of sales represented of revenues in  up from in for the most part  cost of sales dollars decreased in line with the decrease in sales 
the effect of lower average pricing at underground mining and walter coke however  contributed to the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales 
depreciation and depletion expense in increased million compared to the increase was primarily due to our continued investment in the expansion of underground mining mine operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from primarily due to expenditures for our transformation strategy and planned relocation of the company headquarters to birmingham  alabama 
restructuring and impairment charges in included million for the closure of walter coke fiber plant in december  while includes a charge of million related to the impairment in the value of taft mineral interests as of december  operating income was million in  down million versus  primarily due to lower coking coal  metallurgical coke and natural gas pricing and lower metallurgical coke volumes  with lower pricing of these products making up of the decrease in operating income 
net interest expense increased million in from  primarily as a result of million of interest income that was included in  which did not recur in  for a black lung excise tax refund claim 
the total amount of the claim recorded in was million 
of this amount  million was received in the effect of this item was partially offset by the effect of a reduction in both the weighted average borrowings and the weighted average interest rate in as compared to our effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was lower than primarily due to a permanent tax benefit of million recognized in for non taxable opeb medicare part d subsidies and a million net tax benefit recognized in relating to a change in the effective state tax rate 
excluding these items  the effective tax rate in would have been 
both the and effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of percentage depletion deductions 
the current and prior year period results also include the impact of the factors discussed in the following segment analysis 
segment analysis underground mining underground mining revenues decreased million to million in from million in approximately of the decrease was due to lower average selling prices of coking coal  while of the decrease was due to lower coking coal volumes 
lower natural gas pricing resulted in a million decrease in revenues  or approximately of the total decrease 
for the years ended december  average coal selling price per short ton at the port tons of coal sold in thousands average hedged natural gas selling price per mcf billion cubic feet of natural gas sold number of natural gas wells underground mining reported a decrease in operating income of million in  compared to approximately of the decrease in operating income is attributable to decreased pricing of coking coal and natural gas 
lower coking coal volumes  increased labor costs and depreciation and depletion expense contributed to the remainder of the decrease in operating income 
surface mining surface mining reported a revenue increase of million in compared to more than of the increase in revenues is due to an increase in the average coal selling price at tri  while the remainder is due to volume increases  primarily related to the acquisition of taft in september statistics for surface mining are presented in the following table for the years ended december  average coal selling price per short ton tons of coal sold in thousands surface mining reported operating income of million in versus an operating loss of million in the results include a million impairment charge related to a decline in the value of taft mineral interests as of december  excluding this charge  operating income in was million  and the million improvement in operating income from is almost entirely due to an increase in average coal selling prices 
walter coke walter coke revenues decreased million in compared to due to decreased customer demand in the weak domestic steel market 
approximately of the decrease in revenues was due to lower volumes  with the remainder due to a decrease in metallurgical coke selling price as indicated in the table below for the years ended december  metallurgical coke average selling price per short ton metallurgical coke tons sold in thousands walter coke operating loss was million in compared to an operating profit of million in approximately of the decline in operating results was due to lower volumes  while approximately was due to lower average selling prices 
in addition  walter coke recorded a million restructuring and impairment charge and million of inventory write downs in related to the closure of walter coke fiber plant 
financial condition cash and cash equivalents increased by million from million at december  to million at december   reflecting million in cash flows provided by operating activities  mostly offset by million of cash flows used in investing activities and million of cash flows used in financing activities 
see additional discussion in the statement of cash flows section that follows 
net receivables were million at december   an increase of million from december  due to higher revenues in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of current deferred income tax assets were million at december   a decrease of million from december   primarily due to the full utilization of federal net operating loss carryforwards  partially offset by an increase due to the recognition of unconventional fuel source credits for our walter coke segment in the first quarter of net property  plant and equipment was million at december   an increase of million from december   primarily due to the acquisitions of highmount and the mobile river terminal land in long term deferred income tax assets were million at december   a decrease of million from december   primarily due to the first quarter write off of the deferred tax associated with medicare part d subsidies as a result of the enactment of the health care reform act in march of and also due to a change in the applied state deferred tax rates 
accounts payable increased million from million at december  to million at december   primarily attributable to increased freight and royalty costs associated with the increased volumes of coking coal sold in the fourth quarter of versus the fourth quarter of additionally  at december   we had outstanding accounts payable associated with the highmount coal bed methane business that was acquired in the second quarter of the long term portion of the accumulated postretirement benefits obligation was million at december   up million from million at december  the increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in the discount rate for the united mine workers of america portion of the postretirement benefit plan obligation causing an actuarially determined increase to the liability at december  of approximately million 
this adjustment is recognized as a corresponding decrease to stockholders equity 
liquidity and capital resources overview our principal sources of short term funding are our existing cash balances  operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our principal source of long term funding is our bank term loan 
as of december   total debt decreased million as compared to december  see discussion below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
based on current forecasts and anticipated market conditions  we believe that funding generated from operating cash flows and available sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet substantially all operating needs  to make planned capital expenditures and to make all required interest and principal payments on indebtedness for the next twelve to eighteen months 
however  our operating cash flows and liquidity are significantly influenced by numerous factors  including prices of coal and natural gas  coal production  costs of raw materials  interest rates and the general economy 
although we have experienced improvement in the market for our products  renewed deterioration of economic conditions could adversely impact our operating cash flows 
additionally  although financial market conditions have improved  there remains volatility and uncertainty  less availability of credit  potential counterparty defaults  sovereign credit concerns and commercial and investment bank stress 
while we have no indication that the uncertainty in the financial markets would impact our current credit facility or current credit providers  the possibility does exist 
as previously described  in november we entered into a share purchase agreement the share purchase agreement with various funds advised by audley capital to purchase approximately million common shares or approximately of the outstanding common shares of western coal corp 
western coal for cad per share 
on december  we entered into an arrangement agreement the arrangement agreement with western coal collectively the share purchase agreement and the arrangement agreement  the acquisition to acquire all of the remaining outstanding common shares of western coal for  at the holder election  cad per share in cash or of a walter energy share  or for a combination thereof  all subject to proration  if the total cash elections exceed of the aggregate transaction consideration to be paid or the total share elections exceed of the aggregate transaction consideration 
in conjunction with the acquisition  we expect that we will transfer approximately billion to western coal shareholders comprised of approximately billion in cash and million shares of our common stock 
the common stock consideration is valued at approximately billion using our closing share price as of january  of 
the acquisition will be funded through a combination of debt  common stock and cash on hand 
prior to the closing of the acquisition  we anticipate entering into a new billion credit agreement 
as of the closing of the acquisition  we expect to have approximately billion of indebtedness outstanding under the new credit agreement 
in january  as part of the share purchase agreement  we purchased approximately million common shares of western coal  or of the outstanding shares  from funds advised by audley capital for cad per share or approximately billion in cash  thereby reducing the amount of cash to be paid to the remaining western coal shareholders to approximately billion 
under the terms of the share purchase agreement  we will purchase the remaining million shares from funds advised by audley capital upon the earlier of the completion of the acquisition of the common stock of western coal or april  walter credit agreement in  we entered into a million credit agreement walter credit agreement which included  prior to its amendments  an amortizing term loan facility with an initial aggregate principal amount of million  of which million and million was outstanding as of december  and with weighted average interest rates of and  respectively  and an initial million revolving credit facility revolver which provides for loans and letters of credit 
our obligations under the walter credit agreement credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our and our guarantors real  personal and intellectual property  and our ownership interest in the guarantors 
the term loan requires quarterly principal payments of million through october   at which time the remaining outstanding principal is due 
in  we amended the credit agreement to increase the revolver to million 
available funds of million were used to repay principal  interest and fees and terminate certain debt related to the financing segment prior to spin off 
certain other terms  including affirmative and negative covenants as well as restrictions on our ability to engage in specified activities  were also amended  and included  but were not limited to  limitations on increased indebtedness and approval of certain activities associated with our strategic initiatives in businesses that are now discontinued 
in  we amended the credit agreement to extend the maturity date of the revolver from october  to july  and amended the size of the revolver to million that  subject to certain conditions  can be increased to million 
the amendment also increased the interest rate on the revolver to as much as libor plus basis points 
the commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolver was set at per year for all pricing levels compared to a range of to per year prior to the change 
in addition  certain financial covenants in the credit agreement were eliminated 
the amendment did not affect the term loan portion of the credit agreement 
in november  we amended the credit agreement to remove any condition prohibiting us from acquiring approximately million shares of common stock of western coal corp 
from affiliates of audley capital 
these shares were acquired in january see note of notes to consolidated financial statements regarding the pending acquisition of western coal 
as of december   the term loan bears interest at libor plus basis points and we had million in outstanding stand by letters of credit  of which million relates to the support letter of credit discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  no revolver borrowings  and million of availability for future borrowings under the revolver 
other debt in october  we entered into a million equipment financing arrangement for certain previously procured mining equipment 
this facility requires variable monthly payments using a predetermined amortization schedule  carries an interest rate of month libor plus basis points  will mature in the first quarter of and is secured by the financed equipment 
at december   there was million outstanding at a stated interest rate of 
in addition  in  we entered into a million capital lease arrangement to procure certain mining equipment 
the capital lease covers a sixty month period and has an implicit fixed interest rate of 
at december  there was a balance remaining of million 
in june  we entered into an million arrangement  with an implicit interest rate of  to finance the premium payments of our property insurance 
payments of million were made during as of december   the outstanding balance of million is due to be repaid in statements of cash flows the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected consolidated cash flow information in thousands for the years ended december  cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows used in financing activities cash flows provided by continuing operations cash flows provided by used in discontinued operations net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash balances were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in cash in results from cash provided by operating activities of million  mostly offset by capital expenditures of million  cash used in the acquisition of highmount of million  debt repayments of million  purchases of our common stock of million  and cash dividend payments of million 
net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the increase of million is primarily attributable to an increase of million in income from continuing operations  after adjusting for non cash items such as depreciation and depletion and deferred taxes 
cash flows used in investing activities of continuing operations for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the same period in the increase in cash flows used in investing activities of million was primarily attributable to the million of cash used to acquire highmount during the second quarter of  and increased capital expenditures principally related to the acquisition of the mobile river terminal during the fourth quarter of and various other mine development activities at underground mining 
cash flows used in financing activities of continuing operations for the year ended december  were million compared to million of cash flows used in financing activities in the million decrease of cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of million of cash spun off to financing in in conjunction with our april spin off of the financing segment  an increase in proceeds from the exercise and tax benefit of equity awards of million and million  respectively  and a decrease in retirements of debt of million 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program 
capital expenditures capital expenditures totaled million in related principally to our mine no 
east expansion project  the acquisition of the mobile river terminal and other mine development activities at underground mining 
capital expenditures for are expected to total approximately to million 
we currently expect to spend to million of the total in our underground mining operations for equipment to expand the face on two of our longwalls as well as several new shafts planned during the year 
capital expenditures for do not include any potential capital spending for the pending acquisition of western coal 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we have certain contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
contractual obligations are those that will require cash payments in accordance with the terms of a contract  such as a borrowing or lease agreement 
commercial commitments represent potential obligations for performance in the event of demands by third parties or other contingent events  such as lines of credit or guarantees of debt 
the following tables summarize our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  this table does not include interest payable on these obligations

other long term liabilities include pension and other post retirement benefit liabilities 
while the estimated total liability is actuarially determined  there are no definitive payments by period  as pension contributions depend on government mandated minimum funding requirements and other post retirement benefits are paid as incurred 
accordingly  amounts by period included in this schedule are estimates and primarily include estimated post retirement benefits

critical accounting estimates management discussion and analysis is based on  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  particularly note of notes to consolidated financial statements which presents revenues and operating income by reportable segment 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements or disclosed in the related notes thereto 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  using historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from management estimates 
we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates are based upon management historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
inventory valuation the valuation of coal inventories are subject to estimates due to possible gains or losses resulting from inventory movements from the mine site to storage facilities at the port of mobile  inherent inaccuracies in belt scales  and aerial surveys used to measure quantities and due to fluctuations in moisture content 
adjustments to coal tonnages on hand are made for an estimate of coal shortages due to these inherent losses  primarily based on historical findings  related to the results of aerial surveys and periodic coal pile clean ups 
during the five years ended december   results of aerial surveys have indicated that perpetual records require adjustments ranging from to of the ending inventory tonnage balance 
as a result of these historical results  we have recognized a reduction to the ending coal inventory at december  in the amount of million  or of the ending balance  as the estimate of the probable valuation inaccuracy inherent in the inventory balance 
a gain or loss of the inventory balance at december  potentially resulting from these inherent inaccuracies in the measurement processes would result in an increase or decrease  respectively  to income of approximately million 
employee benefits we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retirees  including pensions and postretirement healthcare 
we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap  which include various actuarial assumptions used in developing the required estimates including the following key factors discount rate salary growth retirement rates mortality rates healthcare cost trends expected return on plan assets pension benefits other benefits december  december  december  december  weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations discount rate rate of compensation increase weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic cost discount rate expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase december  pre post pre post assumed health care cost trend rates health care cost trend rate assumed for next year rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline the ultimate trend rate year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate the discount rate used to determine pension and other post retirement expense was for and for the rate of return on plan assets used to determine pension expense is for and for the discount rate is based on a yield curve approach which discounts each projected benefit obligation based cash flow of the liability stream at an interest rate specifically applicable to the timing of each respective liability stream cash flow 
the model sums the present values of all of the cash flows and then calculates the equivalent weighted average discount rate by imputing the single interest rate that equates the total present value with the stream of future cash flows 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of modifications are amortized over future periods 
assumed healthcare cost trend rates  discount rates  expected return on plan assets and salary increases have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension and healthcare plans 
a one percentage point change in the rate for each of these assumptions would have the following effects as of and for the year ended december  in thousands increase decrease percentage point increase percentage point decrease healthcare cost trend effect on total of service and interest cost components effect on postretirement benefit obligation discount rate effect on postretirement service and interest cost components effect on postretirement benefit obligation effect on current year postretirement expense effect on pension service and interest cost components effect on pension benefit obligation effect on current year pension expense expected return on plan assets effect on current year pension expense rate of compensation increase effect on pension service and interest cost components effect on pension benefit obligation effect on current year pension expense we also have significant liabilities for uninsured or partially insured employee related liabilities  including workers compensation liabilities  miners black lung benefit liabilities  and liabilities for various life and health benefits 
the recorded amounts of these liabilities are based on estimates of loss from individual claims and on estimates determined on an actuarial basis from historical experience using assumptions regarding rates of successful claims  discount factors  benefit increases and mortality rates 
workers compensation and black lung benefit liabilities are also affected by discount rates used 
changes in the frequency or severity of losses from historical experience and changes in discount rates or actual losses on individual claims that differ materially from estimated amounts could affect the recorded amount of these liabilities 
at december   a one percentage point increase in the discount rate on the discounted black lung liability would decrease the liability by million  while a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the liability by million 
for the workers compensation liability  we apply a discount rate at a risk free interest rate  generally a us treasury bill rate  for each policy year 
the rate used is one with a duration that corresponds to the weighted average expected payout period for each policy year 
once a discount rate is applied to a policy year  it remains the discount rate for the year until all claims are paid 
the use of this method decreases the volatility of the liability as impacted by changes in the discount rate 
at december   a one percentage point increase in the discount rate on the discounted workers compensation liability would decrease the liability by million  while a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the liability by million 
income taxes accounting principles generally accepted in the us require that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
no valuation allowance has been established against our net deferred tax asset because we believe that the entire deferred tax asset will be realized during the allowed statutory carryforward period 
in our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset  we considered various factors including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if actual results differ from the assumptions made in this evaluation  we may need to record a charge to earnings to reflect the change in our expected valuation of the net deferred tax asset 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we are in dispute with the internal revenue service the irs on a number of federal income tax issues  primarily related to the discontinued homebuilding and financing businesses 
we believe that our tax filing positions have substantial merit and we intend to vigorously defend these positions 
we have established accruals that we believe are sufficient to address claims related to our uncertain tax positions  including related interest and penalties 
since the issues involved are highly complex  are subject to the uncertainties of extensive litigation and or administrative processes and may require an extended period of time to reach ultimate resolution  it is possible that management estimate of this liability could change 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment 
assumptions made in the evaluation of impairment testing can have a significant effect on financial results 
as discussed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  we acquired taft in september a significant portion of the purchase price was allocated to the mineral interests  valued at million 
the value of the mineral interests was based  in part  on the market price of similar coals at the date of acquisition and the forecasts that existed as of that date 
subsequent to the acquisition  the market price and future forecasted market prices for similar coal dropped significantly  triggering a need for an impairment test of the mineral interests 
the results of the impairment test indicated that the fair value of the mineral interests were significantly below the carrying value 
as a result  we recorded a million impairment charge in the fourth quarter 
the estimated fair value of the mineral interests used in the impairment testing was extremely sensitive to the estimated market price of similar coals 
for example  a increase or decrease in the market pricing used as of the date of the impairment testing of this asset would have increased or decreased  respectively  the estimated fair value by approximately million 
accounting for natural gas exploration activities we apply the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas exploration activities 
the costs of drilling exploratory wells are initially capitalized  pending determination of a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves attributable to the area as a result of drilling 
if a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves is not discovered  any associated previously capitalized exploration costs associated with the drilling area are expensed 
in some circumstances  it may be uncertain whether sufficient proved reserves have been found when drilling of an individual exploratory well has been completed 
such exploratory drilling costs  as well as additional exploratory well costs for the area  may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify the area completion as a producing well  or field of production  and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made 
at december  and  capitalized exploratory drilling costs were million and million  respectively 
costs to develop proved reserves  including the cost of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas  are capitalized 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb amended its guidance in asc topic extractive activities oil and gas  expanding the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include the extraction of saleable hydrocarbons from oil sands  shale and coal beds  clarifying that entities equity method investments must be considered in oil and gas activities  and requiring new disclosures 
this updated guidance is generally effective for annual periods ending on or after december   but for entities becoming subject to this standard because of the change in the definition of significant oil and gas producing activities  adoption is required for periods beginning after december  since we became subject to this guidance because we extract hydrocarbons from coal beds  we adopted asc topic as of january  we use the successful efforts method which thereby required us to change our method of accounting for depletion of our gas properties in our coal bed methane business from the straight line method to the unit of production method 
the increase in depreciation and depletion expense from this change resulted in a decrease in our income from continuing operations of approximately million  a decrease in net income of million and a decrease in diluted net income per share in we do not consider the effect of this change to be material to our operating results or financial condition 
market risk we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our operations 
these risks generally arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
our primary market risk exposures relate to interest rate risk and commodity risks 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our primary interest rate risk exposures relate to the interest rates on third party indebtedness 
as described more fully under the caption liquidity and capital resources  above  we have the following financial instruments that inherently expose us to interest rate risk the walter credit agreement  an equipment financing arrangement  a capital lease for certain mining equipment and an insurance premium financing arrangement 
in addition  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we have entered into an interest rate hedge agreement to convert our equipment financing from a floating rate of interest to a fixed rate of interest 
a ten percent decrease in interest rates would result in an increase to annual pre tax income from these financial instruments of approximately million  while a ten percent increase in rates would decrease annual pre tax income approximately million for both december  and commodity risks we are exposed to commodity price risk on sales of natural gas 
our natural gas business sold billion cubic feet of gas during the year ended december  we occasionally utilize derivative commodity instruments to manage the exposure to changing natural gas prices 
such derivative instruments are structured as cash flow hedges and not for trading 
during and  we hedged approximately and  respectively  of our natural gas sales with swap contracts 
these swap contracts effectively converted a portion of forecasted sales at floating rate natural gas prices to a fixed rate basis 
these swap contracts resulted in million of cash inflows in and million of cash inflows in  favorably impacting net revenues 
at december   no swap contracts were outstanding 
at december   swap contracts to hedge approximately million mmbtus of natural gas sales in were outstanding as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements
