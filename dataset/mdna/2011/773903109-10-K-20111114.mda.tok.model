industrial economic trends in  sales to us customers accounted for percent of our total sales 
the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our us served markets include the industrial production index total index  published by the federal reserve  which measures the real output of manufacturing  mining  and electric and gas utilities 
the industrial production index is expressed as a percentage of real output in a base year  currently historically there has been a meaningful correlation between the industrial production index and the level of automation investment made by our us customers in their manufacturing base 
the manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi  published by the institute for supply management ism  which is an indication of the current and near term state of manufacturing activity in the us according to the ism  a pmi measure above indicates that the us manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below indicates that it is generally contracting 
industrial equipment spending  which is an economic statistic compiled by the bureau of economic analysis bea 
this statistic provides insight into spending trends in the broad us industrial economy 
this measure over the longer term has proven to demonstrate a reasonable correlation with our domestic growth 
capacity utilization total industry  which is an indication of plant operating activity published by the federal reserve 
historically there has been a meaningful correlation between capacity utilization and levels of us industrial production 
the table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal to industrial production and capacity utilization have continued to increase 
the pmi was lower than the preceding quarter  but continued to indicate expansion of manufacturing activity 
these indicators are among the factors that lead us to be cautiously optimistic about a continued recovery with slower and potentially more uneven growth

table of contents non us regional trends in  sales to non us customers accounted for percent of our total sales 
these customers include both indigenous companies and multinational companies with expanding global presence 
in addition to the global factors previously mentioned  international demand  particularly in emerging markets  has historically been driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region  investments in infrastructure and expanding consumer markets 
we use changes in gdp as one indicator of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business 
growth in emerging markets continues to exceed global gdp growth rates  but has moderated during fiscal in europe  sovereign debt concerns have put downward pressure on industrial growth 
while these trends indicate slower growth than recently experienced  overall macroeconomic trends and forecasts make us cautiously optimistic that the global recovery will continue into fiscal

table of contents financial condition the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions year ended september  cash provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash cash provided by continuing operations the following table summarizes free cash flow in millions cash provided by continuing operating activities capital expenditures of continuing operations excess income tax benefit from share based compensation free cash flow our definition of free cash flow  which is a non gaap financial measure  takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy 
cash provided by continuing operating activities adds back non cash depreciation expense to earnings and thus does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures 
our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations 
operating  investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations are presented separately in our statement of cash flows 
our accounting for share based compensation requires us to report the related excess income tax benefit as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow 
we have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows 
in our opinion  free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments  service of debt principal  dividends and share repurchases 
we use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance 
our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies 
free cash flow was a source of million for the year ended september  compared to a source of million for the year ended september  free cash flow for both and include discretionary pre tax contributions of million to the company s us pension trust 
the increase in free cash flow is primarily due to improvements in current year earnings  partially offset by higher compensation payments in compared to incentive compensation payments were lower than normal in as difficult economic conditions resulted in reduced or zero earned incentives for in most of our employee incentive compensation plans 
incentive compensation payments generally occur in the first quarter of the year following the year in which the incentive is earned 
we paid substantially all of the incentive compensation earned for performance in the first quarter of  and will pay substantially all of the incentive compensation earned for in the first quarter of commercial paper is our principal source of short term financing 
at september  and  we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding and had no borrowings outstanding during either year 
on october   we contributed million to our us qualified pension trust 
the contribution was funded with a combination of cash on hand and million of commercial paper borrowings 

table of contents we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock in the total cost of these shares was million  of which million was recorded in accounts payable at september   related to  shares that did not settle until october in  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock 
the total cost of these shares was million  of which million was recorded in accounts payable at september   related to  shares that did not settle until october our decision to repurchase stock in will depend on business conditions  free cash flow generation  other cash requirements and stock price 
at september  we had approximately million remaining for stock repurchases under our existing board authorization 
see part ii  item  market for the company s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  for additional information regarding share repurchases 
we expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements  capital expenditures  additional contributions to our pension plans  acquisitions of businesses  dividends to shareowners  repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt 
we expect capital expenditures in to be about million 
we expect to fund these future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances  cash generated by operating activities  commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities 
in addition to cash generated by operating activities  we have access to existing financing sources  including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks 
our debt to total capital ratio was percent at september  and percent at september  this decrease is primarily due to the net increase in shareowners equity 
on march   we replaced our former three year million unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in march and our former day million unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in march with a new four year million unsecured revolving credit facility 
we did not incur early termination penalties in connection with the termination of our former credit facilities 
we have not drawn down under any of these credit facilities at september  or borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest based on short term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding 
the terms of these credit facilities contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debt to total capital ratio was to exceed percent 
we were in compliance with all covenants under these credit facilities at september  and separate short term unsecured credit facilities of approximately million at september  were available to non us subsidiaries 
the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september  credit rating agency short term rating long term rating outlook standard poor s a a stable moody s p a stable fitch ratings f a stable among other uses  we can draw on our credit facility as standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures 
this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the commercial paper ratings set forth in the table above 
under our current policy with respect to these ratings  we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility  if any  to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow  if needed  to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 
our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings are affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions 
we have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date 
if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise  we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide short term funding 
in such event  the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 
we regularly monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents 
our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 
we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

table of contents we enter into contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with certain third party sales and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years and to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies 
our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 
we diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities

supplemental sales information we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period 
therefore  changes in currency rates affect our reported sales 
sales by businesses we acquired also affect our reported sales 
we believe that organic sales  defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions  which is a non gaap financial measure  provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates or acquisitions 
we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional performance 
we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period s sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year 
we determine the effect of acquisitions by excluding sales in the current period for which there are no sales in the comparable prior period 
organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year 
we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management 
retirement benefits pension pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts  including the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  the assumed annual compensation increase rate  the retirement rate  the mortality rate and the employee turnover rate 
changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods 
our global pension expense in was million compared to million in approximately percent of our global pension expense relates to our us pension plan 
the actuarial assumptions used to determine our us pension expense included the following discount rate of percent compared to percent for  expected rate of return on plan assets of percent compared to percent for  and an assumed long term compensation increase rate of percent compared to percent for 
we changed our measurement date in from june to september as required by us gaap 
we recorded a reduction in retained earnings of million million net of tax in the fourth quarter of related to this change 
the pension protection act of was signed into law in august the internal revenue service irs issued final guidance with respect to certain aspects of this law  and  our pension plan valuation has been completed based on the final guidance 
based on this valuation  no minimum contributions were required in we estimate our pension expense will be approximately million in  an increase of approximately million from for  our us discount rate will decrease to percent 
the discount rate was set as of our september measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans 
we have assumed a us long term compensation increase rate of percent in we established this rate by analyzing all elements of compensation that are pension eligible earnings 
our expected rate of return on us plan assets will remain at percent 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term  adjusted for forward looking considerations  such as inflation  interest rates  equity performance and the active management of the plans invested assets 
we also considered our current and expected mix of plan assets in setting this assumption 
the target allocations and ranges of expected return for our major categories of us plan assets are as follows asset category target allocations expected return equity securities debt securities other the financial markets were mixed in the plan s debt securities return exceeded the expected return range in  as lower market interest rates resulted in higher bond values 
the plan s equity securities return trailed the expected return range in  largely due to lower us equity returns and negative international equity returns 
while the financial markets continue to experience volatility  we have not changed our expectation for long term returns for the asset categories in which our plan assets are invested 
actual return for our portfolio of us plan assets has approximated percent annualized for the years ended september   and has exceeded percent annualized for the years ended september  
table of contents the changes in our discount rate and return on plan assets have an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost 
the change in our discount rate also has an inverse relationship with our projected benefit obligation 
the change in our compensation increase rate has a direct relationship with our net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation

table of contents revenue recognition for approximately percent of our consolidated sales  we record sales when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  pricing is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred  as may be required according to contract terms  or services have been rendered 
although the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  our control product solutions business also sells certain products  solutions and services that require separate delivery 
we divide these arrangements into separate deliverables and revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on the relative selling price of each element provided the delivered elements have value to customers on a standalone basis and delivery or performance of the undelivered items is probable and substantially in our control 
we recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as construction type contracts using either the percentage of completion or completed contract methods of accounting 
we record sales relating to these contracts using the percentage of completion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable  we use the completed contract method for all others 
under the percentage of completion method  we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion 
under the percentage of completion method  we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified 
we record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified 
we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale 
we use shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
returns  rebates and incentives our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product 
we also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates  account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria 
certain distributors are offered a right to return product  subject to contractual limitations 
we record accruals for customer returns  rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience 
adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns  rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual 
a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed 
if the time period were to change by percent  the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately million 
returns  rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits 
rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided 
accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or  where a right of offset exists  as a reduction of accounts receivable 
the accrual for customer returns  rebates and incentives was million at september  and million at september   of which million at september  and million at september  was included as an offset to accounts receivable 

table of contents litigation  claims and contingencies we record liabilities for litigation  claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation 
we also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures 
the liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated and third party sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party 
at third party environmental sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified  we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties 
at environmental sites where we are the only responsible party  we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation 
we do not discount future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their present value 
environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup 
to the extent that remediation procedures change  additional contamination is identified  or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected  the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change 
our reserve for environmental matters was million  net of related receivables of million  at september  and million  net of related receivables of million  at september  our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses formerly owned by us legacy businesses for which we retained the responsibility to remediate 
the nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low 
as a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters  we expect that gradually  over a long period of time  our environmental obligations will decline 
however  changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations 
our principal self insurance programs include product liability where we are self insured up to a specified dollar amount 
claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies issued by commercial insurers 
we estimate the reserve for product liability claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued 
adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims 
the reserve for product liability claims was million at september  and million at september  various lawsuits  claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business 
as described in part i  item legal proceedings  we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago 
see part i  item for further discussion 
we accrue for costs related to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset that results from the acquisition  construction  development or the normal operation of the long lived asset 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional 
identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities 
we estimate conditional asset retirement obligations using site specific knowledge and historical industry expertise 
a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates 
we recorded these liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet  which totaled million in other current liabilities and million in other liabilities at september  and million in other current liabilities and million in other liabilities at september  in conjunction with the sale of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses  we agreed to indemnify baldor electric company for costs and damages related to certain legacy legal  environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before january   for which the maximum exposure is capped at the amount received for the sale 
we estimate the potential future payments we could incur under these indemnifications may approximate million  of which million and million has been accrued in other current liabilities and million and million has been accrued in other liabilities at september  and  respectively 
a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates 
more information regarding litigation  claims and contingencies is contained in note in the financial statements 

table of contents income taxes we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by us federal  state and foreign jurisdictions 
additionally  we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years 
our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction  the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters  our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 
while we have support for the positions we take on our tax returns  taxing authorities may assert interpretations of laws and facts and may challenge cross jurisdictional transactions 
cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products  services  and or intellectual property as well as various us state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures 
the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits  excluding interest and penalties  was recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of million at september  and million at september  the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that would reduce our effective tax rate for continuing operations if recognized was million at september  and million at september  we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense 
total accrued interest and penalties were million at september  and million at september  we believe it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by up to million during the next months as a result of the resolution of worldwide tax matters and the lapses of statutes of limitations 
we recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss  tax credit  and capital loss carryforwards carryforwards and certain temporary differences in the amount of million at september  and million at september  based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction 
the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty that the carryforwards and certain temporary differences will be realized 
our income would increase if we determine we will be able to use more carryforwards or certain temporary differences than currently expected 
at the end of each interim reporting period  we estimate a base effective tax rate that we expect for the full fiscal year based on our most recent forecast of pretax income  permanent book and tax differences and global tax planning strategies 
we use this base rate to provide for income taxes on a year to date basis  excluding the effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their related tax effects 
we record the tax effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
we sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations 
these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries  transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location s functional currency 
our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 
the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of million and a liability of million at september  we enter into these contracts with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to us dollars 
in and  the relative weakening of the us dollar versus foreign currencies had a favorable impact on our revenues and results of operations 
while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict  our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens relative to levels 
certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities 
for such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts  a percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pre tax income by approximately million 
we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them 
the use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset  in whole or in part  losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 
derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings 
for derivatives that are hedges  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value in earnings immediately 
the ineffective portion was not significant in and a hypothetical percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents interest rate risk in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities  we use a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 
our short term debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings 
we had no outstanding commercial paper or bank borrowings at september  and in october  we borrowed million in commercial paper in order to partially fund a million discretionary contribution to our us qualified pension trust 
due to the low level of variable rate borrowings in and  interest rate changes would not have had a material impact on interest expense 
we had outstanding fixed rate long term debt obligations with carrying values of million at september  and million at september  the fair value of this debt was  million at september  and  million at september  the potential reduction in fair value on such fixed rate debt obligations from a hypothetical percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt 
we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed rate instruments before their maturity and  therefore  fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners equity
