we are a medical technology company primarily focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics and medical devices for cardiovascular and ischemic disease  wound healing and tissue repair

we have established a pipeline of innovative products that are divided into two operating units  cardium biologics and the tissue repair company 
we report our operations in a single operating segment 
our business is focused on the acquisition and strategic development of product opportunities or businesses having the potential to address significant unmet medical needs  and definable pathways to commercialization  partnering or other monetization following the achievement of corresponding development objectives 
consistent with our overall business strategy  as our product opportunities and businesses are advanced and corresponding valuations established  we intend to consider various corporate development transactions designed to place our product candidates into larger organizations or with partners having existing commercialization  sales and marketing resources  and a need for innovative products 
such transactions could involve the sale  partnering or other monetization of particular product opportunities or businesses

we currently have limited products available for sale or use 
because of the limited nature of our revenues and the high costs we must incur to develop our product candidates  we have yet to generate positive cash flows or income from operations and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
as a result  we are currently dependent on debt and equity funding to finance our operations 
during the second half of we raised net proceeds of million from the sale of common stock and warrants in two registered direct offerings

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included under item in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and their accompanying notes 
we have identified certain policies such as derivative liabilities and stock option compensation expense that are calculated using the binomial and black scholes option model that we believe are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we base our estimates on our historical experience  industry standards  and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 

table of contents actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an adverse effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  and results of operations could occur if circumstances change that alter the various assumptions or conditions used in such estimates or assumptions 
if we were to undervalue our derivative liabilities or stock option compensation expense we would understate the expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operation 
conversely if we were to overvalue our derivative liabilities and stock option compensation expenses we would overstate the expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal for the year ended december  revenue was  attributable to a one time grant from the federal government for therapeutic discovery 
that grant is complete  and we do not anticipate any further revenues from that grant 
revenue for the year ended december  was  which was earned under a grant awarded by the national institutes of health  nih specifically the national heart  lung blood institute  a sponsored program by the federal government 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the same period last year 
the decrease of  was primarily due to a reduction in expenses related to our excellarate product candidate in its phase b clinical trial 
there were also reductions in generx aware phase clinical trial costs partially offset by a performance bonus accrual of  which was accrued during the second quarter of and covers  and half of the accrued performance bonus was paid in the third quarter of the remainder will be paid upon our receipt of fda k clearance for our excellagen product 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease of  was primarily the result of decreases in professional fees and stock option compensation expense  insurance costs and rent offset by a performance bonus accrual of  which was accrued during the second quarter of and covers  and half of the accrued performance bonus was paid in the third quarter of the remainder will be paid upon our receipt of fda k clearance for our excellagen product 
change in fair value of derivative liabilities was a gain of  compared to a loss of  for the prior year 
the change in fair value was attributable to the decline in the value of derivative liability as a result of declines in the market value for our common stock during interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the same last year 
the  increase in interest income for the period when compared to the same period last year was related to the increase in cash available for investment during the respective periods 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  interest expense was  for the year ended december   due to the interest associated with the notes we issued in november  march and june  all of which we paid off at the end of we experienced a gain of  in connection with the warrant exchange

there was no comparable expense for the period ended december  net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a net loss from continuing operations of  for the year ended december  the decline in net loss was attributable to a decrease in interest expense and a favorable adjustment in the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities 

table of contents impact of certain non cash charges the adoption of asc had a very substantial impact on our total liabilities  including certain non cash derivative liabilities and corresponding reported net gains and losses arising from changes in the underlying market value of our common stock  to supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements  which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  our management uses a non gaap financial measure called non gaap earnings or loss per share 
we define non gaap earnings or loss per share as net income or loss not including the impact of non cash items amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount  stock based compensation  and change in fair value of derivative liabilities  loss from discontinued operations and gain on sale of business unit 
it should be noted that basic and diluted weighted average shares are determined on a gaap basis and the resulting share count is used for computing both gaap and non gaap basic and diluted earnings per share 
our management believes non gaap earnings or loss per share provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of the core business operating results and may help in comparing current period results with those of prior periods as well as with our peers 
we use this information as an additional tool for evaluating our financial results in a manner that reflects ongoing operations and facilitates comparisons with operating results from prior periods 
the presentation of this additional non gaap information is intended to provide investors with additional incremental tools for their review of our results and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with gaap 
reconciliation of non gaap measure net income loss to non gaap earnings or loss per share for the three months and fiscal year ended december  three months ended december  year ended december  net income loss add subtract stock based compensation expense amortization of deferred financing cost and debt discount change in fair value of derivative liabilities gain on warrant exchange income loss from discontinued operations gain on sale of business unit non gaap net loss non gaap net loss per common share basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding basic weighted average common shares outstanding diluted

our working capital at december  was  excluding  for the fair value of derivative liabilities 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  when compared to last year was a result of the decrease in companywide spending  the sale of all the assets of our innercool business in july and the completion of the matrix clinical study during the fourth quarter of our primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from financing activities and in particular proceeds from the sales of our debt and equity securities 
on march   we completed a registered direct offering of  units  which were sold to institutional and retail investors  at a price of per unit 
each unit consisted of shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock 
the warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of per share  at any time after six months from the date of closing and have a term of exercise equal to five years from the date the warrants are initially exercisable 
in the aggregate  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock were issued in the offering 
the offering resulted in gross proceeds to us of million  and net proceeds of approximately million after payment of offering fees and expenses 
on august  we filed a form s registration statement declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on august  putting in place a universal shelf registration statement covering up to million of any combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants  or units we may offer through august   at which time we will provide the specific term of any offering in one or more supplements to the prospectus 
this registration statement is intended to allow us to capitalize on strategic opportunities that may arise  we do not have any current commitments for shares to be registered under the registration

our principal objective is to complete a strategic licensing agreement or secure the approval and future sales of the excellagen product family and or another corporate transaction 
if we fail to enter into a strategic licensing arrangement or generate sufficient product sales  we will not generate sufficient cash flows to cover our operating expenses 
we do not have any credit facilities in place or unused sources of credit available to us at this time 
although we intend to secure additional working capital through sales of additional debt or equity securities we 
table of contents have not secured any financing at this time  and we cannot give any assurances about the availability or terms of any future financing 
our history of recurring losses and uncertainties as to whether our operations might become profitable raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets or classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions  arrangements  obligations including contingent obligations or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on financial condition  changes in financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  capital resources  or significant components of revenue or expenses material to investors
