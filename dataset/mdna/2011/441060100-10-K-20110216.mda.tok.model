as of december   hospira operated manufacturing facilities globally 
hospira principal manufacturing facilities are identified in item of this report 
hospira largest facilities  located in rocky mount  north carolina  austin  texas  laaurora  costa rica  mcpherson  kansas  and mulgrave  victoria  australia  account for a significant portion of hospira manufacturing output 
hospira manufacturing facility in irungattukottai  india and its joint venture manufacturing facility near ahmedabad  india may also be significant manufacturing facilities for hospira in during  hospira temporarily shut down certain of its production lines to respond to certain quality issues cited in a warning letter as described in quality assurance in item if hospira experiences any further significant interruption of manufacturing at any of the foregoing facilities  such an interruption could materially and adversely affect hospira ability to manufacture and sell its products 
hospira has a joint venture with cadila healthcare limited  an indian domestic pharmaceutical company located in ahmedabad  india 
the joint venture  zydus hospira oncology pvt 
ltd 
zhopl  operates a manufacturing facility in a special economic zone outside of ahmedabad  india  that has been inspected and approved by the united kingdom medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency and the fda 
since  the facility has been manufacturing a number of cytotoxic drugs for sale by both cadila and hospira in their respective exclusive territories in the united states  europe and other countries 
in addition  in and  hospira has entered into separate and independent contract manufacturing agreements with zhopl for the production of numerous other cytotoxic drugs that hospira will sell under its own label throughout the world 
raw materials and components while hospira produces some materials  components and active pharmaceutical ingredients at its manufacturing sites  the majority are sourced on a global basis from third party suppliers 
although many of the materials and components hospira uses to produce its products are readily available from multiple suppliers  hospira relies on supply from a single source for many raw materials and components 
for example  hospira relies on certain proprietary components available exclusively from icu medical 
icu medical clave tm and microclave tm connector products are components of administration sets that represented approximately of hospira us net sales 
in addition  hospira purchases some of its other raw materials  components and active pharmaceutical ingredients 
table of contents from single suppliers for reasons of quality assurance  sole source availability  cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements 
to manage risk  hospira works closely with its suppliers to ensure continuity of supply 
in addition  hospira attempts to diversify its sources of materials and continually evaluates alternate source suppliers 
in certain circumstances  it may pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources  depending upon the strength of its existing supplier relationships  the reliability of its current supplier base  and the time and expense associated with the regulatory process 
a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by hospira in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the performance of its products or incorporate unique technology 
the loss of certain supply arrangements  including certain arrangements for active pharmaceutical ingredients  certain commodities  and the clave tm supply arrangement with icu medical which continues through would have a material adverse effect on its business 
quality assurance hospira has developed and implemented quality systems and concepts throughout its organization 
hospira is actively involved in setting quality policies and managing internal and external quality performance 
its quality assurance department provides quality leadership and supervises its quality systems 
an active audit program  utilizing both internal and external auditors  monitors compliance with applicable regulations  standards and internal policies 
in addition  hospira facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
hospira has received notices from regulatory authorities alleging violations of applicable regulations and standards  and hospira has developed definitive action plans  implemented remedial programs and modified its practices to address these issues 
during  hospira received a warning letter from the fda related to hospira corrective action plans with respect to the failure of certain ac power cords manufactured by a third party 
the recall was limited to device power cords with a certain prong design that could crack and fail at or inside the plug 
in october  the fda notified hospira that it appeared that hospira had addressed the warning letter deficiencies and that future fda inspections would further assess the adequacy and sustainability of these corrections 
in december  the fda notified hospira that the ac power cord recall activities were completed and the fda considered the recall terminated 
during  hospira received a warning letter from the fda in connection with the fda inspection of hospira pharmaceutical and device manufacturing facilities located in rocky mount  north carolina  and clayton  north carolina the warning letter 
in the warning letter  the fda cites current good manufacturing practice deficiencies related to particulate in certain emulsion products at the clayton facility and the failure to adequately validate the processes used to manufacture products at the rocky mount facility 
the warning letter also asserts other inadequacies  including procedures related to the quality control unit  investigations  and medical reporting obligations 
the warning letter asserts that some of the deficiencies were repeat observations from a prior inspection conducted in april  and include a similar violation cited in the august warning letter related to the ac power cords 
the fda did not believe that hospira had identified the root cause s of the problems and had adequately resolved them 
the warning letter also questioned whether hospira interim plans ensured the quality of products that were manufactured at the facilities while implementing the corrective actions and validation activities 
hospira has made significant progress on completing a comprehensive review of its manufacturing operations to ensure compliance with applicable regulations 
in january  the fda completed an inspection of the clayton facility with no observations noted by the inspector 

table of contents nothing in either the october or december letters precludes any future regulatory action by the fda should violations be observed in subsequent inspections or through other means  and these letters do not relieve hospira from the responsibility to assure compliance with the food  drug and cosmetic act in the future 
the fda warning letters are publicly available on the fda web site 
hospira has responded to the warning letter and is working closely with the fda to conclude this matter 
in april  hospira placed a voluntary hold on all shipments to new customers of symbiq tm  a large volume infusion device 
hospira initiated this hold after it received an unexplained increase in customer complaints related to the failure of the symbiq tm to alarm at the end of infusion therapy under certain use conditions 
in june  hospira notified customers on interim steps to be taken by customers to mitigate this issue and to avoid the use conditions that can lead to the failure of the symbiq tm to alarm at the end of infusion therapy 
in august  hospira initiated a set recall related to the issue 
additionally  hospira notified customers of reports of unrestricted flow when the symbiq tm infusion set cassette is improperly removed from the pump before the pump cassette door is fully opened 
hospira cautioned customers to allow the pump cassette door to fully open before removing the infusion set as the pump may not alarm when the infusion set is improperly removed 
the fda has classified each of these actions as a class i recall and hospira is working closely with the fda to conclude these matters 
further  hospira is developing a solution to improve the performance of the pump and the issues therewith 
hospira has not asked customers to return or cease using their symbiq tm pumps 
in december  hospira informed the fda that hospira had received a small number of customer reports associated with the plum tm pumps regarding failure of the pump audible alarm under certain conditions 
hospira has provided notice to customers notifying them of the corrective action plan 
for the plum a tm pumps  the alarm failures are associated with the alarm assembly which will need to be replaced 
for the plum xl tm pumps  the alarm failure is associated with fluid ingress and physical damage to the alarm assembly over time 
plum xl tm customers are being asked to follow the proper cleaning procedure and inspect the alarm assembly for physical damage during routine maintenance 
this action is classified as a field recall and fda is not requiring hospira to remove plum tm pumps from the market or halt production

competition hospira industry is highly competitive 
hospira believes that the most effective competitors in its industry are those focused on product quality and performance  breadth of product offering  and manufacturing efficiency as well as the ability to develop and deliver cost effective products that help hospitals improve the safety of patient care  reduce medication errors and provide high quality care 
these are increasingly important factors in a healthcare environment that requires increasing levels of efficiency and productivity 
hospira most significant competitors in pharmaceuticals include baxter international inc baxter  bedford laboratories a division of boehringer ingelheim  fresenius medical care ag  sandoz  teva pharmaceuticals teva  as well as divisions of several multinational pharmaceutical companies 
local manufacturers of pharmaceuticals also compete with hospira on a country by country basis 
hospira most significant competitors in medication management include baxter  b 
braun melsungen ag  carefusion and fresenius medical care ag 
hospira believes that it is one of the 
table of contents leading competitors  in terms of us market share  in each of its major product lines  and believes that its size  scale  customer relationships and breadth of product line are significant contributors to its market positions 
hospira believes that to further its competitive position it must continue to invest significantly in  and successfully execute  its research and product development activities  and optimize its manufacturing efficiency and productivity 
particularly  for its pharmaceutical products  hospira seeks to maximize its opportunity to establish a first to market position for its generic injectable drugs  and for its medication management products  hospira seeks to differentiate its products through technological innovation and an integrated approach to drug delivery

the use of generic pharmaceuticals is subject to variations in the structure of health care systems including purchasing practices and government policies regarding the use of generic products and pricing  which all lead to differing levels of customer acceptance 
there are different policies and levels of generic penetration in each country in emea  causing the competition for generic pharmaceuticals to differ widely 
in emea  competitors tend to vary by country and are often smaller in scale than those in the us  although some consolidation and geographic expansion is now occurring 
teva is the largest company that competes with hospira in the generic oncology market across europe 
hospira other key competitors vary from country to country 
the use of generic pharmaceuticals in the apac segment is subject to variations in government policies and public perception 
in australia  generic penetration is moderate and growing primarily due to changes in government support 
competitors include sandoz and teva  a number of smaller competitors and the innovator companies 
in asia  hospira sells its products primarily to hospitals 
hospira competition in asia tends to be with the originator companies and multinational companies such as teva and actavis 
in japan  the market share of generic pharmaceutical products traditionally has been low because of quality perceptions  product format and other regulatory differences in comparison to other markets 
the japanese government is actively pursuing a program to double generic usage 
laws in japan have been introduced to allow for easier substitution of generics for branded pharmaceuticals and to change financial incentives for hospitals and clinics to use generics  in a government sponsored effort to reduce costs  which is believed to have resulted in an increased acceptance of generic pharmaceutical products

the anti kickback statute provides a number of exceptions or safe harbors for particular types of transactions 
while hospira generally does not file claims for reimbursement from government payors  the us federal government has asserted theories of liability against manufacturers under the federal false claims act  which prohibits the submission of false claims to medicare  medicaid  and other state and federal programs 
many states have similar fraud and abuse laws which apply to hospira 
anti bribery laws hospira global activities are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act us fcpa and other countries anti bribery laws that have been enacted in support of the organization for economic cooperation and development anti bribery convention 
these laws prohibit companies and individuals from offering or providing anything of value to government officials with the intent of inappropriately gaining a business advantage 
they also require companies to maintain accurate books and records and internal financial controls 
a new anti bribery law that will become effective in april is the uk bribery act of in addition to prohibitions similar to the us fcpa  this law also prohibits commercial bribery and makes it a crime for a company to fail to prevent bribery 
companies have the burden of proving that they have adequate procedures in place to prevent bribery 
the enforcement of such laws in the us and elsewhere has increased dramatically in the past few years  and authorities have indicated that the pharmaceutical and medical device industry will be a significant focus for enforcement efforts 
hospira has a compliance program in place to ensure compliance with these laws by its employees and agents and to communicate its expectations of compliance to third parties  including its distributors 
environmental laws hospira manufacturing operations are subject to many requirements under environmental laws 
in the us  the environmental protection agency and similar state agencies administer laws which 
table of contents restrict the emission of pollutants into the air  the discharge of pollutants into bodies of water and the disposal of hazardous substances 
the failure to obtain a permit for certain activities may be a violation of environmental laws 
most environmental agencies also have the power to shut down an operation if it is operating in violation of environmental laws 
us laws also allow citizens to bring private enforcement actions in some situations 
outside the us  the environmental laws and their enforcement vary  and can be more burdensome 
for example  in some european countries  there are environmental taxes and laws requiring manufacturers to take back used products at the end of their useful life 
this does not currently have a significant impact on hospira products  but such laws are expanding rapidly in europe 
hospira has management systems in place that are intended to minimize the potential for violation of these laws 
other environmental laws address the contamination of land and groundwater  and require the clean up of such contamination 
hospira has been involved with a number of sites at which clean up has been required  some as the sole owner and responsible party  and some as a contributor in conjunction with other parties 
hospira believes that environmental compliance has not had  and will not have  a material adverse effect on our operations  results or competitive position 
safety and health laws in the us  the occupational safety and health act sets forth requirements for conditions of the workplace 
hospira operations are subject to many of these requirements  particularly in connection with hospira employees use of equipment and chemicals at manufacturing sites that pose a potential health or safety hazard 
transportation laws hospira operations include transporting materials defined as hazardous over land  sea and through the air 
all of these activities are regulated under laws administered by the us department of transportation and similar agencies outside the us they include complex requirements for packing  labeling and recordkeeping 
customs  export and anti boycott laws the import and export of products  technology  equipment and other business materials across national borders are subject to regulation by us agencies  including the us customs and border protection  the bureau of industry and security  department of commerce and the office of foreign assets control treasury department  as well as other national and supranational regulatory authorities 
as the importer and exporter of products and technologies  hospira must comply with all applicable customs  export and anti boycott laws and regulations and must pay fees and duties on certain shipments 
state laws there are numerous legal and regulatory requirements imposed by individual states in the us on pharmaceutical and medical device companies doing business in those states 
for example  several states and the district of columbia either require the tracking and reporting of specific types of interactions which pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare professionals or restrict such interactions 
a similar requirement arose under the ppaca to track spending on physicians and teaching institutions  beginning on january  the data will be reportable to an agency of the federal government in this reporting requirement is expected to preempt some but not all of the state disclosure requirements 

table of contents other laws hospira is also subject to a variety of other laws  directives and regulations in and outside of the us  including income  value added and excise taxes 
hospira stays abreast of  and plans for  proposed legislation that could significantly affect our operations

risk factors hospira business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below 
these risks and uncertainties may cause hospira sales and results of operations to fluctuate significantly  hospira past performance to not be indicative of future performance  and hospira actual performance to differ materially from hospira expectations or projections 
the risks described below may not be the only risks hospira faces 
additional risks that hospira does not yet know of or that hospira currently thinks are immaterial may also impair its business operations 
this form k also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
hospira results could materially differ from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including the risks described below 
see the section captioned forward looking statements 
hospira faces significant competition and may not be able to compete effectively 
the healthcare industry is highly competitive 
hospira competes with many companies that range from small  highly focused companies to large diversified healthcare manufacturers that have access to greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources 
there has been consolidation by hospira competitors and customer base  which has resulted in pricing and sales pressures  causing competition to become more intense 
hospira present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by competitors or by the introduction of competing products by one or more of its competitors 
to remain competitive and bolster its competitive position  hospira believes that it must successfully execute various strategic plans  including expanding its research and development initiatives and productivity  lowering its operating costs  and improving its business processes 
these initiatives may result in significant expenditures and ultimately may not be successful 
hospira failure to compete effectively could cause it to lose market share to its competitors and have a material adverse effect on its sales and profitability 

table of contents if hospira does not successfully introduce new products in a timely manner  its sales and operating results may decline 
a key component to hospira strategy is effective execution of its research and development activities 
without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements  hospira products may become obsolete over time  causing its sales and operating results to suffer 
if hospira does not continue to develop generic injectable pharmaceuticals in a timely manner  its competitors may develop products that are more competitive than hospira  and hospira could find it more difficult to renew or expand gpo pricing agreements or to obtain new agreements 
the ability to launch a generic pharmaceutical product at or before generic market formation is important to that product profitability 
prices for generic products typically decline  sometimes dramatically  following market formation  as additional companies receive approvals to market that product and competition intensifies 
if a company can be first to market  such that the branded drug is the only other competition for a period of time  higher levels of sales and profitability can be achieved 
with increasing competition in the generic product market  the timeliness with which hospira can market new generic products will increase in importance 
if hospira is unable to bring its generic products to market on a timely basis  and secure first to market positions  its sales and profitability could be adversely impacted 
hospira is also actively working to develop and commercialize biosimilar products 
hospira has entered into several agreements described under product development and manufacturing related to expanding its biosimilars portfolio and capabilities 
the success of our biosimilars activities depends on several factors  including among other factors  the adoption of certain laws and regulations  ability to obtain regulatory approvals  and the success of the arrangements with third parties 
these activities will require a substantial investment of the company resources  which may not result in commercially successful products 
in  the patient protection affordable care act was passed and signed into law in the us this legislation includes new authorization to the fda to approve companies to market biosimilar products in the us the regulations under this law have not been developed yet 
those regulations may delay or prevent generic drug producers such as hospira from offering certain products  such as biosimilar products in key territories  which could harm hospira ability to grow its business 
hospira may not be able to generate future sales of such products in certain jurisdictions and may not realize the anticipated benefits of its investments in the development  manufacture and sale of such products 
delays in receipt of  or failure to obtain  approvals for product candidates could result in delayed realization of product revenues and in substantial additional costs 
hospira faces similar risks if it does not introduce new versions or upgrades to its medication management portfolio 
innovations generally require a substantial investment in product development before hospira can determine their commercial viability  and hospira may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these innovations 
even if hospira succeeds in creating new product candidates from these innovations  such innovations may still fail to result in commercially successful products 
the success of new product offerings will depend on several factors  including hospira ability to properly anticipate customer needs  obtain timely regulatory approvals  and manufacture quality products in an economic and timely manner 
even if hospira is able to successfully develop new products or enhancements  they may not produce sales equal to or greater than the costs of development or may not avoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 
moreover  innovations may not become successful because of difficulties encountered in achieving positive clinical outcomes  meeting safety  efficacy or other regulatory requirements of government agencies  or obtaining favorable pricing on such products 

table of contents finally  innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of  among other things  entrenched patterns of clinical practice  and uncertainty over third party reimbursement 
failure to effectively manage efforts or to realize the benefits under product collaboration agreements may harm hospira business and profitability 
hospira collaborates with other companies for the development  regulatory approval  manufacturing and marketing of new products in both the specialty injectable pharmaceutical and medication management product lines 
hospira has entered into collaboration agreements relating to the long term development and commercialization of proprietary and biosimilar products  which hospira views as an important long term opportunity for its specialty injectable pharmaceutical product line 
hospira ability to benefit from these arrangements will depend on its ability to successfully manage these arrangements and the performance of the other parties to these arrangements 
hospira and the other parties to these arrangements may not efficiently work together  leading to higher than anticipated costs and delays in important activities under the arrangements 
the other parties to these arrangements may not devote the resources that are required for the arrangement to be successful 
these arrangements are often governed by complex agreements that may be subject to differing interpretations by the parties  which may result in disputes 
the development of proprietary and biosimilar products may require substantial investment by hospira 
hospira may not be able to realize the expected benefits of such investment 
these factors are often beyond the control of hospira  and could harm hospira sales  product development efforts and profitability 
hospira is subject to the cost containment efforts of wholesalers  distributors  third party payors and government organizations  which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
hospira relies on drug wholesalers to assist in the distribution of its generic injectable pharmaceutical products 
while hospira has business arrangements in place with its major drug wholesalers  if hospira is required to pay fees not contemplated by its existing arrangements  hospira will incur additional costs to distribute its products  which may harm hospira profitability 
hospira products and services are sold to hospitals and alternate site providers  such as clinics  home healthcare providers and long term care facilities which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from third party payors  such as government programs  private insurance plans and managed care programs 
these third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services 
levels of reimbursement  if any  may be decreased in the future  and future healthcare reform legislation  regulations or changes to reimbursement policies of third party payors may otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of hospira products  which could have a material adverse effect on hospira sales and profitability 
in markets outside the us  hospira business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing as a result of the concentrated buying power of governments as principal customers and the use of bid and tender sales methods whereby hospira is required to submit a bid for the sale of its products 
hospira failure to offer acceptable prices to these customers could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profitability in these markets 
if hospira is unable to obtain or maintain its gpo and idn pricing agreements  sales of its products could decline 
many existing and potential customers for hospira products have combined to form gpos  and idns in an effort to lower costs 
a small number of gpos influence a majority of sales to hospira hospital customers in the us gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply 
table of contents manufacturers and distributors  and these negotiated prices are made available to a gpo or an idn affiliated hospitals and other members 
failure to negotiate advantageous pricing and purchasing arrangements could cause hospira to lose market share to its competitors and have a material adverse effect on its sales and profitability 
hospira has pricing agreements for certain products with the major gpos in the us  including amerinet  inc  healthtrust purchasing group lp  medassets  inc  novation  llc  pact  llc  and premier purchasing partners  lp 
it is important for hospira to continue to maintain pricing arrangements with major gpos 
in order to maintain these relationships  hospira must offer a reliable supply of high quality  regulatory compliant products 
hospira also needs to maintain a broad product line and be price competitive 
several gpo contracts are up for renewal or extension each year 
moreover  some of the agreements may be terminated on or days notice  while others may not be terminated without breach until the end of their contracted term 
if hospira is unable to renew or extend one or more of those contracts  or one or more of the contracts are terminated  and hospira cannot replace lost business  hospira sales and profitability will decline 
there has been consolidation among major gpos  and further consolidation may occur 
the effect of consolidation is uncertain  and consolidation may impair hospira ability to contract with gpos in the future 
the gpos also have a variety of business relationships with hospira competitors and may decide to enter into pricing agreements for  or otherwise prefer  products other than hospira 
while gpos negotiate incentives for members to purchase specified products from a given manufacturer or distributor  gpo pricing agreements allow customers to choose between the products covered by the arrangement and another manufacturer products  whether or not purchased under a negotiated pricing agreement 
as a result  hospira may face competition for its products even within the context of its gpo pricing agreements 
changes in the buying patterns of hospira customers could adversely affect hospira operating results 
during  sales through the four largest wholesalers that supply products to many end users accounted for approximately of hospira global net sales 
hospira profitability may be impacted by changes in the buying patterns of these wholesalers  or any other major distributor  or wholesale customer 
their buying patterns may change as a result of end use buyer purchasing decisions  end use customer demand  pricing  or other factors  which could adversely affect hospira results of operations 
hospira and its suppliers and customers are subject to various governmental regulations  and it could be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 
in addition  failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to sanctions which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
hospira products are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda  and numerous other national  supranational  federal and state governmental authorities 
the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device  particularly from the fda and governmental authorities outside the us  can be costly and time consuming  and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis  if at all 
to ensure ongoing customer safety  regulatory agencies such as the fda may re evaluate their current approval processes and may impose additional requirements 
in addition  the fda and others may impose increased or enhanced regulatory inspections for domestic or foreign plants 
the fda  along with other regulatory agencies around the world  has been experiencing a backlog of generic drug and medical device applications  which has delayed approvals of new products 
those delays have become longer  and may continue to increase in the future 
these delays can result in higher levels of unapproved inventory and increased costs due to excess and obsolescence exposures 

table of contents hospira collaborative partners and suppliers may not be able to remain in compliance with applicable fda and other material regulatory requirements once it has obtained clearance or approval for a product 
these requirements include  among other things  regulations regarding manufacturing practices  product labeling  advertising and postmarketing reporting  and adverse event reports and field alerts 
in addition  manufacturing flaws  component failures  design defects  off label uses or inadequate disclosure of product related information could result in an unsafe condition or the injury or death of a patient 
hospira may be required by regulatory authorities  or determine on its own  to issue a safety alert  recall or temporarily cease production and sale of certain products to resolve manufacturing and product quality concerns 
all of these events could harm hospira sales  margins and profitability in the affected periods and may have a material adverse effect on hospira business 
for information related to the and fda warning letters received by hospira and other voluntary recalls and corrective actions  including those related to hospira pumps  see the section captioned quality assurance under item above and management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation in part ii  item in response to certain quality issues  hospira placed a voluntary hold on all shipments to new customers of symbiq tm 
also during  hospira temporarily shut down certain of its production lines to respond to the quality issues cited in the warning letter 
hospira has also been working with third party consultants in connection with the warning letter  who have been overseeing hospira activities to ensure it is developing compliant processes and procedures 
these activities have increased the time to get product to market 
if the fda is not satisfied with hospira progress  this could result in longer delays to market or additional production line shut downs 
the fda could find additional violations in subsequent inspections or through other means 
in some circumstances  adverse events arising from or associated with the design  manufacture or marketing of our products could result in the suspension or delay of regulatory reviews of our applications for new product approvals or clearances 
any of the foregoing could disrupt our business and harm our reputation  resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
hospira is also subject to various federal  state  and foreign laws pertaining to foreign corrupt practices and healthcare fraud and abuse  including anti kickback and false claims laws 
violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and or civil sanctions  including  in some instances  substantial fines  imprisonment and exclusion from participation in national  federal and state healthcare programs  including medicare  medicaid  and veterans administration health programs and health programs outside the us these laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretations  which could require hospira to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices 
in addition  violations of these laws  or allegations of such violations  could disrupt hospira business and result in a material adverse effect on hospira sales  profitability and financial condition 
for a more detailed listing of the laws and regulations that significantly affect hospira business and operations  see the section captioned in item governmental regulation and other matters 
any adverse regulatory action  or action taken by hospira to maintain appropriate regulatory compliance  with respect to these laws and regulations could disrupt hospira business and have a material adverse effect on its sales  profitability and financial condition 
furthermore  an adverse regulatory action with respect to any hospira product  operating procedure or manufacturing facility could materially harm hospira reputation in the marketplace 
proposed changes in fda regulations or actions related to infusion pumps and medical devices may lead to increased costs and delays  which could negatively impact hospira business 
in april  the fda issued a draft guidance document entitled total product life cycle infusion pump premarket notification 
k 
submissions 
through this new draft guidance  the fda has established additional pre market requirements for infusion pumps 
the proposed guidance is subject to further revisions by the fda  but the fda expectation is that the guidelines should be 
table of contents followed in the interim 
at the same time  the fda is also enhancing its pre market requirements for medical devices generally 
although hospira cannot predict with certainty the future impact of these initiatives  it appears that the process for obtaining regulatory approvals to market infusion pumps and medical devices will become more costly and time consuming 
in addition  the new requirements could result in longer delays for the approval of new products as well as remediation of existing products in the market 
future delays in the receipt of  or failure to obtain  approvals could result in delayed or no realization of product revenues 
hospira may continue to acquire other businesses and assets  license rights to technologies or products from third parties  form alliances  or dispose of businesses and assets  and any of these actions may not be completed in a timely or cost effective manner  or at all 
as part of hospira business strategy  hospira may continue to acquire other businesses and assets  license rights to technologies or products from third parties  form alliances  or dispose of businesses and assets  and any of these actions may not be completed in a timely or cost effective manner  or at all 
hospira also may pursue strategic alliances to expand its product offerings and geographic presence  as recently evidenced by hospira expanding its manufacturing presence in india 
hospira may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner  on a cost effective basis  or at all  and may not realize the expected benefits of any acquisition  license arrangement  strategic alliance  or disposition 
other companies  including those with substantially greater resources  may compete with hospira for opportunities 
if hospira is successful in securing certain opportunities  the products and technologies that hospira acquires may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated 
hospira may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business 
to finance acquisitions or other investments  hospira has incurred  and may continue to incur or assume significant debt 
this significant indebtedness may require hospira to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to servicing its debt  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures  to pursue other acquisitions or investments  and for general corporate purposes 
in addition  this significant indebtedness may increase hospira vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions  including increases in interest rates 
in addition  this may limit hospira flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in or challenges relating to its business and industry 
hospira may incur greater than expected costs in connection with these transactions if it encounters difficulties or issues not known to it at the time of entering into the transaction 
in addition  hospira may enter markets in which it has no or limited prior experience 
hospira could experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition related charges 
any of these negative effects could cause a downgrade of hospira credit rating  which would affect hospira ability to obtain new financing and negatively impact hospira cost of financing and credit 
the company is increasingly dependent on its outsourcing and third party provider arrangements 
hospira is increasing its dependence on third party providers for certain services  including certain information technology  research and development  third party manufacturing  and finance and accounting outsourcing arrangements 
the failure of these service providers to meet their obligations or the development of significant disagreements or other factors may materially disrupt hospira ongoing relationship with these providers or the services they provide could negatively affect operations 
challenging economic conditions could adversely affect our operations 
the securities and credit markets have experienced volatility in the past  and in some cases  exerted negative pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain companies 
hospira ability to access the credit and capital markets  and the related cost of borrowings  will depend on a variety of factors  including market conditions  the availability of credit and the strength of 
table of contents hospira credit rating 
in addition  lending institutions  including those associated with hospira million revolving credit facility which expires in  may suffer losses due to their lending and other financial relationships 
as a result  lenders may become insolvent  which could affect the actual availability of credit under hospira revolving credit facility  or hospira ability to obtain other financing on equally favorable terms 
moreover  insurance companies and other financial institutions may suffer losses  which could affect the cost and availability of insurance coverage 
if one or more of these events occurred  hospira liquidity may prove to be insufficient  cost of borrowing may increase and hospira financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  demand for hospira products may decrease due to adverse economic conditions  resulting in the loss of jobs or healthcare coverage  thereby affecting an individual ability to pay for elective healthcare 
in addition  adverse economic conditions may increase hospira customers cost containment efforts  and affect hospira customers solvency or their ability to obtain credit to finance their purchases of hospira products  which could reduce hospira revenue and cause a decrease in hospira profitability 
these economic conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers  which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products 
acquisitions have increased hospira investment balances  intangible assets and goodwill balances  and a decline in the value of assets may adversely affect hospira financial position or results of operation 
as a result of hospira acquisitions  intangible assets and goodwill have become significant 
the values for these assets can be affected by factors  such as increased competition  development discontinuation  delay in regulatory approval  product quality  changes in business strategies and the impact of restructurings  disposition transactions  and business combinations 
as a result of these factors or other events  hospira may have to impair these assets or change estimated useful lives  which may have a material adverse effect on hospira financial position or results of operations 
in addition  hospira regularly reviews its investments  including equity and cost based investments  to determine when a significant event or change in circumstance has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment 
hospira considers numerous factors  including factors affecting the investee  factors affecting the industry of the investee  and general equity market trends 
hospira also considers the length of time an investment market value has been below carrying value and the near term prospects for recovery to carrying value 
volatility in the global equity markets and other factors could adversely impact the fair value of hospira investments and  as a consequence  could result in a charge for an other than temporary decline in value  which could have an adverse effect on hospira financial position and results of operations 
the manufacture of hospira products is highly exacting and complex  and if hospira or its suppliers encounter problems manufacturing  storing or distributing products  hospira business could suffer 
the manufacture of hospira products and products hospira produces for third parties is highly exacting and complex  due in part to strict regulatory requirements governing the manufacture of drugs and medical devices 
problems may arise during manufacturing  storage or distribution of hospira products and products hospira manufactures for third parties for a variety of reasons  including equipment malfunction  failure to follow specific protocols and procedures  manufacturing quality concerns  or problems with raw materials  electromechanical  software and other components  supplier issues  and natural disaster related events or other environmental factors 
if problems arise during the production  storage or distribution of a batch of product  that batch of product may have to be discarded 
problems could also lead to increased costs  lost sales  damage to customer relations  failure to supply penalties  time and expense spent investigating the cause and  depending on the cause  similar losses with respect to other batches or products 
if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market  voluntary recalls  corrective actions or product liability related costs may also be 
table of contents incurred 
problems with respect to the manufacture  storage or distribution of its products could materially disrupt hospira business and harm its sales and profitability 
hospira can experience higher costs to produce its products as a result of rising oil and gas prices 
hospira uses resins and other petroleum based materials as raw materials in many of its products 
prices of oil  fuel  and other gases also significantly affect hospira costs for freight and utilities 
oil  fuel  and other gas prices are volatile 
if costs increase and hospira is unable to fully recover these costs through price increases or offset these increases through other cost reductions  hospira could experience lower margins and profitability 
hospira depends on third parties to supply raw materials  electromechanical and other components  and third party finished goods 
hospira may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials  which could limit hospira ability to manufacture or sell products on a timely basis and could harm its profitability 
the manufacture of hospira products requires raw materials  active pharmaceutical ingredient and electromechanical and other components that must meet stringent fda and other regulatory requirements 
while efforts are made to diversify our sources of materials and components  some of these raw materials and other components are currently available from a limited number of suppliers 
for example  hospira relies on certain proprietary components available exclusively from icu medical 
for a description of that relationship  see the section captioned raw materials and components in item in addition  hospira purchases from single sources certain compounding material  polyvinyl chloride resin and laminate film components for hospira production of certain flexible bags that it uses with its iv and pre mixed solutions  as well as rubber components that it uses with some of its injectable pharmaceuticals 
hospira also obtains from single sources certain active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished products 
identifying alternative suppliers and obtaining approval to change or substitute a raw material or component  or the supplier of a finished product  raw material or component  can be time consuming and expensive  as testing  validation and regulatory approval are necessary 
while we work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply  we cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful 
in the past  hospira business has experienced shortages in some of the raw materials and components of its products 
continuous supply of petroleum based products is especially risky due to the limited number of capable suppliers  limited production capacity and the effect of natural disasters 
if suppliers are unable to deliver sufficient quantities of these materials on a timely basis or if supply is otherwise disrupted  including by suppliers exiting the market  the manufacture and sale of hospira products may be disrupted  and its sales and profitability could be adversely affected 
hospira cost reduction and optimization activities have resulted  and may continue to result  in significant charges and cash expenditures 
these activities may disrupt hospira business and may not result in the intended cost savings 
hospira strategy  in part  relies on the establishment of a low cost operating infrastructure to improve margins and cash flow to drive sustained growth 
in addition to the several initiatives under project fuel  hospira has taken various other actions to dispose of  or close  certain manufacturing  research and development  and other facilities 
these actions have resulted in  and are expected to continue to result in  significant charges to hospira results of operations and cash expenditures 
cost reduction and optimization activities are complex  and if hospira does not successfully manage these activities  its operations and business could be disrupted and hospira may incur more costs than 
table of contents anticipated 
in connection with these activities  the company failure to hire or retain personnel with the right expertise and experience in operations that are critical to its business functions could adversely impact the execution of its business strategy 
future cost reduction and optimization activities  if taken  may result in additional charges and cash expenditures  which may be material 
if hospira does not realize the expected savings from its cost reduction and optimization efforts  its profitability may be adversely affected 
hospira manufacturing capacity could limit its ability to expand its business without significant capital investment 
from time to time  hospira may need to invest substantial capital resources to expand its manufacturing capacity if hospira introduces new products  demand increases significantly for its products  or if it is successful in obtaining significant additional customers for its injectable pharmaceuticals contract manufacturing services business 
these efforts may not be completed in a timely or cost effective manner  and hospira may not realize the desired benefits of these efforts 
to ensure hospira manufacturing capacity aligns with expected future commercial growth and demand  hospira may be taking steps in india over the next few years to prepare for the expansion of hospira global footprint 
as a result of cost reduction efforts  hospira has announced the closing of  or has sold  certain of its facilities 
while hospira believes it has available manufacturing capacity to absorb  or has had the ability to outsource  the production at these closed or sold facilities  there may be less available capacity at hospira facilities 
if hospira experiences an interruption in manufacturing at any of its primary manufacturing facilities  it may not be able to produce sufficient products for its customers 
as a result  hospira sales  margins and profitability may be adversely impacted 
hospira relies on the performance of its information technology systems  the failure of which could have an adverse effect on hospira business and performance 
hospira operates in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure 
these systems are vulnerable to interruption by fire  power loss  system malfunction and other such events  which are beyond hospira control 
systems interruptions could reduce hospira ability to manufacture its products  and could have a material adverse effect on hospira operations and financial performance 
the level of hospira protection and disaster recovery capability varies from site to site  and there can be no guarantee that any such plans  to the extent they are in place  will be totally effective 
hospira conducts operations outside of the us and is subject to additional risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  that may cause its sales and profitability to decline 
sales in markets outside the us comprised approximately of net sales 
hospira anticipates that sales from outside the us will continue to represent a significant portion of net sales 
the additional risks associated with hospira operations outside the united states include i fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for a discussion of the ways and extent to which hospira attempts to mitigate such risk  see part ii  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  ii multiple regulatory requirements that are subject to change  which may delay or deter hospira international product commercialization efforts  iii differing local medical practices  product preferences and product requirements  iv trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements or other controls or restrictions  
table of contents v difficulty in establishing  staffing and managing operations outside the us  vi differing labor regulations or work stoppages or strikes at hospira union facilities  vii complying with us regulations that apply to international operations  including trade laws  the us fcpa and anti boycott laws  viii loss of business through government tenders that are held annually in many cases  ix potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  including legislative changes in the us and international taxation of income earned outside of the us  x political and economic instability  xi disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic area  due to the location of manufacturing facilities  distribution facilities or customers  caused by natural or man made disasters or other causes  and xii diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the us in addition  hospira operates in many countries outside the us through distributors 
its success will depend on the efforts and performance of such distributors  which are beyond hospira control 
if certain of those distributor relationships are unsuccessful  the costs to terminate such distributor relationship and or to re establish a customer base could adversely affect hospira profitability in certain regions 
these risks could have an adverse effect on hospira ability to distribute and sell its products in markets outside the us and could adversely affect hospira profitability 
hospira is involved in various lawsuits and proceedings that could negatively affect its business 
hospira is involved in various claims and legal proceedings  as well as product liability claims and proceedings related to hospira business  including in some instances when hospira operated as part of abbott 
in some instances  these claims and proceedings could preclude the continued sale and marketing of hospira products or otherwise adversely affect operations  profitability or liquidity 
these claims and proceedings include those described in item legal proceedings 
these matters could have an adverse effect on hospira business  profitability or financial condition 
in addition  there could be an increase in scope of these matters and there could be additional lawsuits  claims  proceedings or investigations in the future 
in the past  hospira has been involved in investigations related to improper marketing and pricing practices with respect to certain medicare and medicaid reimbursable products 
hospira could be subject to these investigations or lawsuits again in the future  and these matters could have an adverse impact on hospira 
hospira may incur product liability losses and insurance coverage could be inadequate or unavailable to cover these losses 
hospira business is subject to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of drugs and medical devices and products 
in the ordinary course of business  hospira is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits  including those described in item legal proceedings  alleging that its products have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to patients 
product liability claims and lawsuits  safety alerts  recalls or corrective actions  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could have a material adverse effect on hospira business and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers 
hospira is responsible for all liabilities  including liabilities for claims and lawsuits  related to its business  whether they arose before or after the spin off  other than certain liabilities relating to allegations that it engaged in improper marketing and pricing practices in connection with federal  state 
table of contents or private reimbursement for its products 
as part of hospira risk management policy  hospira carries third party product liability insurance coverage  which includes a substantial retention or deductible which provides that hospira will not receive insurance proceeds until the losses incurred exceed the amount of that retention or deductible 
to the extent that any losses are within these retentions or deductibles  hospira will be responsible for the administration and payment of these losses 
product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on hospira profitability and financial condition 
if hospira is unable to protect its intellectual property rights  its business and prospects could be harmed 
hospira relies on trade secrets  confidentiality agreements  continuing technological innovation and  in some cases  patent  trademark and service mark protection to preserve its competitive position 
a failure to protect hospira intellectual property could harm its business and prospects  and its efforts to protect its proprietary rights may not be adequate 
most of hospira products are not protected by patents or other proprietary rights  and have limited or no market exclusivity 
patent filings by third parties could render hospira intellectual property less valuable 
in addition  intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in certain countries outside the us  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position 
competitors may also harm sales of hospira products by designing products that mirror the capabilities of those products or technology without infringing hospira intellectual property rights 
if hospira does not obtain sufficient protection for its intellectual property  hospira competitiveness in international markets could be impaired  which could limit its growth and future sales 
if hospira infringes the intellectual property rights of third parties  hospira may face legal action  increased costs and delays in marketing new products 
hospira seeks to launch generic pharmaceutical products either where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired  where patents have been declared invalid or where products do not infringe the patents of others 
to achieve a first to market position for generic pharmaceutical products  hospira may take action  such as litigation  to seek to assert that its products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable 
these actions and litigation could be costly and time consuming  and may not be successful 
hospira has made abbreviated new drug applications and certifications known as paragraph iv certifications in the us that the relevant patents for existing products would not be infringed by a hospira product  or were invalid or unenforceable  in the us and equivalent filings in canada 
claims filed by innovators challenging these paragraph iv certifications may delay or prevent the launch of the relevant products and result in additional costs 
hospira is currently involved in patent related disputes with companies with branded products over hospira attempts to market generic pharmaceutical products 
once hospira has final approval of the related generic pharmaceuticals in the us  hospira may decide to commercially market these products while the ultimate disposition of legal proceedings has not concluded 
if hospira products are ultimately found to infringe the patent rights of another company  hospira may be subject to significant damages  which may be based on the lost profits from the sale of the branded product and or an injunction preventing hospira from further sales 
third parties may claim that hospira products are infringing their intellectual property rights 
claims of intellectual property infringement could be costly and time consuming and might require hospira to enter into costly royalty or license agreements  if hospira is able to obtain royalty or license agreements on acceptable terms 
hospira also may be subject to significant damages or an injunction preventing it from manufacturing  selling or using some of its products in the event of a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement 
any of these adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on hospira profitability and financial condition 

table of contents changes in the funded status or costs of hospira pension or post retirement benefit plans could adversely affect hospira financial position and results of operations 
the funded status of hospira pension and post retirement benefit plans is subject to developments and changes in actuarial and other related assumptions 
decreases in the valuation of plan assets  particularly with respect to equity securities  and a change in the actual rate of return on plan assets can result in significant changes to the expected return on plan assets in the following year and  as a consequence  could result in higher funding requirements and net periodic benefit costs 
in addition  changes in assumptions  such as discount rates  mortality rates  retirement rates  healthcare cost trend rates and other factors  may lead to significant increases in the value of the respective obligations 
assumption changes could affect the reported funded status of hospira plans and  as a result  could result in higher funding requirements and net periodic benefit costs 
all of these factors could have an adverse effect on hospira financial position and results of operations 
income taxes can have an unpredictable effect on hospira results of operations and result in greater than anticipated liabilities 
hospira is subject to income taxes in a variety of jurisdictions  and its tax structure is subject to review by both domestic and foreign taxation authorities 
because hospira income tax expense for any period depends heavily on the mix of income derived from the various taxing jurisdictions during that period  which is inherently uncertain  its income tax expense and reported net income may fluctuate significantly  and may be materially different than forecasted 
moreover  changes in or interpretations of tax laws and regulations including laws related to the remittance of foreign earnings  changes in investments in foreign countries with favorable tax rates  and settlements of federal  state and foreign tax audits  may affect hospira profitability and financial condition 
hospira is the beneficiary of tax exemptions in certain jurisdictions outside the us  where a portion of its income is earned 
these tax exemptions have a significant impact on reducing hospira overall effective tax rate 
if hospira is unable to maintain these tax exemptions  hospira future profitability may be reduced 
changes in laws or governmental policies can affect the availability of these exemptions 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and in evaluating tax positions that are subject to audits and adjustments 
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are established when  despite hospira belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  positions taken by hospira are likely to be challenged based on the applicable tax authority determination of the positions 
although hospira believes its tax provisions and related liability balances are reasonable  the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in its financial statements and may materially affect its financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 
the stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in hospira operating results  as well as other factors  could cause its stock price to decline 
during the past few years  the stock market has experienced fluctuations  which has significantly impacted the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance 
market fluctuations could adversely affect hospira stock price 
moreover  hospira sales and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter due to the risk factors set forth herein 
hospira stock price could fluctuate significantly in response to its quarterly results and the impact of these risk factors on hospira operating results or financial position

certain quality and product related matters warning letter august during  hospira received a warning letter from the fda related to hospira corrective action plans with respect to the failure of certain ac power cords manufactured by a third party 
hospira had recognized charges in in cost of products sold for quality assessment and testing  materials  labor and freight to remediate this matter  which were not significant to date to hospira 
the recall was limited to device power cords with a certain prong design that could crack and fail at or inside the plug 
in october  the fda notified hospira that it appeared that hospira had addressed the warning letter deficiencies and that future fda inspections would further assess the adequacy and sustainability of these corrections 
in december  the fda notified hospira that the ac power cord recall activities were completed and the fda considered the recall terminated 
nothing 
table of contents in either the october or december letters precludes any future regulatory action by the fda should violations be observed in subsequent inspections  and these letters do not relieve hospira from the responsibility to assure compliance with the food  drug and cosmetic act in the future 
warning letter april in april  hospira received a warning letter from the fda in connection with the fda inspection of hospira pharmaceutical and device manufacturing facilities located in rocky mount  north carolina and clayton  north carolina 
in the warning letter  the fda cites current good manufacturing practice deficiencies related to particulate in certain emulsion products at the clayton facility and the failure to adequately validate the processes used to manufacture products at the rocky mount facility 
the warning letter also asserts other inadequacies  including procedures related to the quality control unit  investigations  and medical reporting obligations 
the warning letter asserts that some of the deficiencies were repeat observations from a prior inspection conducted in april  and include a similar violation cited in the august warning letter related to the ac power cords 
the fda did not believe that hospira had identified the root cause s of the problems and had adequately resolved them 
the warning letter also questioned whether hospira interim plans ensured the quality of products that were manufactured at the facilities while implementing the corrective actions and validation activities 
hospira has made significant progress on completing a comprehensive review of its manufacturing operations to ensure compliance with applicable regulations 
hospira has responded to the april warning letter and is working closely with the fda to conclude these matters 
as part of hospira response  hospira took immediate actions to address the fda concerns  including recalling the propofol and liposyn products manufactured at the clayton facility and the fosphenytoin sodium injection products manufactured at the rocky mount facility 
hospira is also working with several third party experts to assist with the ongoing activities at both facilities 
hospira has implemented certain interim controls  including third party oversight  to ensure products manufactured at both facilities meet their specifications prior to release 
the warning letter does not restrict production or shipment of hospira products from these facilities but hospira is holding shipment of certain products pending its further investigation and discussions with the fda 
hospira resumed shipment of certain products placed on voluntary shipping hold  but cannot predict when all products on voluntary hold will be reintroduced to the market 
during  hospira recognized pre tax charges  in cost of products sold  of million for third party oversight and consulting  idle facility costs and penalties for failure to supply product to certain customers under various contracts  all directly associated with hospira response to the fda warning letter received in april these costs include activities associated with the matters cited above for the rocky mount and clayton facilities as well as hospira assessment of the status of its quality operations on a holistic basis throughout its global manufacturing facilities 
symbiq tm pumps in april  hospira placed a voluntary hold on all shipments to new customers of symbiq tm  a large volume infusion device 
hospira initiated this hold after it received an unexplained increase in customer complaints related to the failure of the symbiq tm to alarm at the end of infusion therapy under certain use conditions 
in june  hospira notified customers on interim steps to be taken by customers to mitigate this issue and to avoid the use conditions that can lead to the failure of the symbiq tm to alarm at the end of infusion therapy 
in august  hospira initiated a set recall related to the issue 
additionally  hospira notified customers of reports of unrestricted flow when the symbiq tm infusion set cassette is improperly removed from the pump before the pump cassette door is fully opened 
hospira cautioned customers to allow the pump cassette door to fully open before removing the infusion set as the pump may not alarm when the infusion set is improperly removed 
the fda has classified each of these actions as a class i recall and hospira is working closely with the 
table of contents fda to conclude these matters 
hospira has not asked customers to return or cease using their symbiq tm pumps 
hospira has recognized charges in cost of products sold for quality assessment and testing  materials  and labor to remediate these matters  which have not been significant to date to hospira 
additionally  hospira is working to address the failure to alarm issue with a software upgrade package 
the software upgrade package submission will be one of the first to follow the guidelines of the new k process of the fda  thus approval timing remains uncertain 
new pump placements for symbiq tm will remain on voluntary hold until we receive fda approval of our k submission 
further  costs for long term solutions and product improvements will depend on various product development efforts and corresponding regulatory outcomes in connection therewith 
plum tm pumps in december  hospira informed the fda that we had received a small number of customer reports associated with the plum tm pumps regarding failure of the pump audible alarm under certain conditions 
hospira has provided notice to customers notifying them of the corrective action plan 
for the plum a tm pumps  the alarm failures are associated with the alarm assembly which will need to be replaced 
for the plum xl tm pumps  the alarm failure is associated with fluid ingress and physical damage to the alarm assembly over time 
plum xl tm customers are being asked to follow the proper cleaning procedure and inspect the alarm assembly for physical damage during routine maintenance 
this action is classified as a field recall and fda is not requiring hospira to remove plum tm pumps from the market or halt production 
hospira will service the pumps in the field  for which hospira recognized a charge of million for the estimate of the field recall as of december  regulatory environment and related impact these quality matters have impacted  and may impact further  hospira ability to market and sell certain products including hospira pumps and certain emulsion products primarily in the americas segment 
additionally  these quality matters have resulted in  and may further result in  higher customer backlog orders and penalties for failure to supply products  which historically have not been material 
the fda warning letters are publicly available on the fda website 
hospira takes all of these matters seriously and responds fully  and in a timely manner  to the fda warning letters 
hospira cannot  however  give any assurances as to the expected date of resolution of the matters related to pumps or the matters included in the warning letters 
while hospira continues to work to resolve the remaining matters described above  there can be no assurance that additional costs or penalties will not be incurred  and that additional regulatory actions with respect to hospira will not occur 
until the violations and other product matters are corrected  hospira may be subject to additional regulatory actions by the fda  including the withholding of approval of new drug applications  product seizure  injunction  and or civil monetary penalties 
changes in and stricter enforcement of the laws and regulations impacting hospira industry may result in changes to customer buying patterns  increased investment in quality systems and personnel and additional on market remediation activities being classified as recalls  including improvement related activities that are deemed by the fda to reduce the risk to health posed by the products 
any such additional fda actions  or further adverse developments related to pumps  could significantly disrupt our ongoing business and operations and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and operating results 
there can be no assurance that the fda or customers will be satisfied with hospira response and corrective actions 

table of contents patent related product matters hospira is involved in patent related disputes with companies with branded products over our attempts to market generic pharmaceutical products 
in april  hospira reached an agreement to settle the us litigation related to oxaliplatin 
pursuant to the settlement  hospira exited the us market with its oxaliplatin products on june  and is expected to re launch its products pursuant to a royalty free license on august  hospira is currently awaiting final approvals for an oncolytic drug docetaxel a generic version of sanofi aventis taxotere in the us that is the subject of ongoing patent litigation 
once hospira has final approval for its generic pharmaceuticals in the us  we may decide to commercially market these products while the ultimate disposition of legal proceedings has not concluded 
additionally  hospira received final approval in the us and launched in november a gram freeze dried powder presentation of gemcitabine a generic version of eli lilly gemzar  that is subject to ongoing patent litigation 
if hospira products are ultimately found to infringe the patent rights of another company  hospira may be subject to significant damages  which may be based on the lost profits from the sale of the branded product and or an injunction preventing hospira from further sales

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
hospira believes its most critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item revenue recognition hospira recognizes revenues from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for other than certain drug delivery pumps and contract manufacturing  product revenue is recognized when products are delivered to customers and title passes 
in certain circumstances  hospira enters into arrangements in which it commits to provide multiple elements deliverables to its customers 
contract manufacturing involves filling customers active pharmaceutical ingredients api into delivery systems 
under these arrangements  customers api is often consigned to hospira and revenue is recorded for the materials and labor provided by hospira  plus a profit  upon shipment to the customer 
upon recognizing revenue from a sale  hospira records an estimate for certain items that reduce gross sales in arriving at its reported net sales for each period 
these items include chargebacks  rebates and other items such as cash discounts and returns 
provisions for chargebacks and rebates represent the most significant and complex of these estimates 
arrangements with certain multiple deliverables hospira accounts for sales of drug delivery pumps pumps and server based suite of software applications software  inclusive of certain software related services  under multi element arrangements  depending on the functionality of the software associated with the pump  as one or two units of accounting 

table of contents hospira allocates revenue to arrangements with multiple deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  hospira applies a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price esp 
vsoe generally exists only when hospira sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by hospira for that deliverable 
where vsoe and tpe are not available  hospira process for determining esp includes multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 
key factors considered in developing the esp for pumps  software and software related services include prices charged by hospira for similar offerings  historical pricing practices  the market and nature of the deliverable and the relative esp of certain deliverables compared to the total selling price of the arrangement 
for certain arrangements where the software is not essential to the functionality of the pump  hospira has identified three primary deliverables 
the first deliverable is the pump which is recognized as delivered  the second deliverable is the related sale of disposable products sets which are recognized as the products are delivered and the third deliverable is the software and software related services 
revenue recognition for the third deliverable is further described below in the software section 
the allocation of revenue for the first and second deliverable is based on vsoe and for the third deliverable is based on hospira esp 
for other arrangements where the software is essential to the functionality of the pump  hospira has also identified three primary deliverables 
the first deliverable is the pump and software essential to the functionality of the pump which is delivered and recognized at the time of installation 
the second deliverable is the related sale of sets which are recognized as the products are delivered and the third deliverable is software related services 
revenue recognition for the third deliverable is further described below in the software section 
the allocation of revenue for the first deliverable is based on hospira esp 
the allocation of revenue for the second deliverable is based on vsoe and for the third deliverable is based on hospira esp 
software hospira accounts for the server based suite of software applications not essential to the functionality of a pump and related maintenance and implementation services in accordance with industry specific accounting guidance for software and software related transactions 
for such transactions  revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element  and fair value is generally determined by vsoe 
if hospira cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in such multiple element arrangements  hospira defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed 
perpetual software license revenue and implementation service revenue are generally recognized as obligations are completed 
software subscription license and software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the applicable contract period 
chargebacks hospira sells a significant portion of its specialty injectable pharmaceutical products through wholesalers  which maintain inventories of hospira products and later sell those products to end customers 
in connection with its sales and marketing efforts  hospira negotiates prices with end customers for certain products under pricing agreements including  for example  group purchasing organization contracts 
consistent with industry practice  the negotiated end customer prices are typically lower than the prices charged to the wholesalers 
when an end customer purchases a hospira product that is covered by a pricing agreement from a wholesaler  the end customer pays the wholesaler the price determined under the pricing agreement 
the wholesaler is then entitled to charge hospira back for the difference between the price the wholesaler paid hospira and the contract price paid by the end customer a chargeback 
hospira records the initial sale to a wholesaler at the price invoiced to the wholesaler and at the same time  records a provision equal to the estimated amount the wholesaler will later charge back to 
table of contents hospira  reducing gross sales and trade receivables 
this provision must be estimated because the actual end customer and applicable pricing terms may vary at the time of the sale to the wholesaler 
accordingly  the most significant estimates inherent in the initial chargeback provision relate to the volume of sales to the wholesalers that will be subject to chargeback and the ultimate end customer contract price 
these estimates are based primarily on an analysis of hospira product sales and most recent historical average chargeback credits by product  estimated wholesaler inventory levels  current contract pricing  anticipated future contract pricing changes and claims processing lag time 
hospira estimates the levels of inventory at the wholesalers through analysis of wholesaler purchases and inventory data obtained directly from certain wholesalers 
hospira regularly monitors the provision for chargebacks and makes adjustments when it believes the actual chargebacks may differ from earlier estimates 
the methodology used to estimate and provide for chargebacks was consistent across all periods presented 
hospira total chargeback accrual for all products was million and million at december  and  respectively  and included in trade receivables 
settlement of chargebacks generally occurs between and days after the sale to wholesalers 
a one percent decrease in end customer contract prices for sales pending chargeback at december   would decrease net sales and income before income taxes by approximately million 
a one percent increase in units sold subject to chargebacks held by wholesalers at december   would decrease net sales and income before income taxes by approximately million 
rebates hospira offers rebates to direct customers  customers who purchase from certain wholesalers at end customer contract prices and government agencies  which administer various programs such as medicaid 
direct rebates are generally rebates paid to direct purchasing customers based on a contracted discount applied to the direct customer purchases 
indirect rebates are rebates paid to indirect customers that have purchased hospira products from a wholesaler under a pricing agreement with hospira 
governmental agency rebates are amounts owed based on legal requirements with public sector benefit providers such as medicaid  after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases 
hospira estimates the amount of the rebate due at the time of sale  and records the liability and a reduction of gross sales at the same time the product sale is recorded 
settlement of the rebate generally occurs from to months after sale 
in determining provisions for rebates to direct customers  hospira considers the volume of eligible purchases by these customers and the rebate terms 
in determining rebates on sales through wholesalers  hospira considers the volume of eligible contract purchases  the rebate terms and the estimated level of inventory at the wholesalers that would be subject to a rebate  which is estimated as described above under chargebacks 
upon receipt of a chargeback  due to the availability of product and customer specific information  hospira can then establish a specific provision for fees or rebates based on the specific terms of each agreement 
rebates under governmental programs are based on the estimated volume of products sold subject to these programs 
each period the estimates are reviewed and revised  if necessary  in conjunction with a review of contract volumes within the period 
hospira regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs 
at december  and  accrued rebates of million and million  respectively  are included in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
the methodology used to estimate and provide for rebates was consistent across all periods presented 

table of contents the following table is an analysis of chargebacks and rebates for years ended and dollars in millions chargebacks rebates balance at january  provisions payments balance at december  provisions payments and releases balance at december  hospira generic oxaliplatin sales  launched in the us in and temporarily exited the market in june  contributed to the increase and subsequent decrease in the chargebacks and rebate accrual 
hospira released million for a portion of the chargeback accrual relating to in for oxaliplatin sales as the expected rate of price decrease was less than estimated and typically experienced in generic product launches 
adjustments for rebates related to prior period sales have not been material in any period 
returns provisions for returns are provided for at the time the related sales are recognized  and are reflected as a reduction of sales 
the estimate of the provision for returns is primarily based on historical experience of actual returns 
additionally  hospira considers other factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel  product dating and expiration period  whether products have been discontinued and entrance in the market of additional competition 
this estimate is reviewed periodically and  if necessary  revised  with any revisions recognized immediately as adjustments to net sales 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market 
inventory cost includes material and conversion costs 
hospira monitors inventories for exposures related to obsolescence  excess and date expiration  non conformance  product recalls and loss and damage  and recognizes a charge to cost of products sold for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to estimated net realizable value 
if conditions are less favorable than estimated  additional charges may be required 
such reserves were million and million at december  and  respectively 
stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification asc topic  compensation stock compensation  asc  share based payment transactions are recognized as compensation cost over the vesting period based on the fair value of the instrument on the date of grant 
hospira uses the black scholes option valuation model and the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of stock options and performance share awards  respectively 
the fair value models include various assumptions  including the expected volatility and expected life of the awards 
these assumptions reflect hospira best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of hospira control 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  stock based compensation expense  as calculated could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if hospira uses different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation 
table of contents expense could be materially impacted in future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information regarding stock based compensation 
pension and other post retirement benefits hospira provides pension and other post retirement medical and dental benefits to certain of its active and retired employees based both in and outside of the us hospira develops assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rate 
for these assumptions  management consults with actuaries  monitors plan provisions and demographics and reviews public market data and general economic information 
these assumptions reflect hospira best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of hospira control 
assumption changes could affect the reported funded status of hospira plans and  as a result  could result in higher funding requirements and net periodic benefit costs 
the us discount rate estimates were developed with the assistance of actuarially developed yield curves 
for non us plans  benchmark yield data for high quality fixed income investments for which the timing and amounts of payments match the timing and amounts of projected benefit payments is used to derive discount rate assumptions 
the expected return on assets for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits are expected to be paid 
the expected return on assets is developed from the expected future return of each asset class  weighted by the expected allocation of pension assets to that asset class 
hospira considers historical performance for the types of assets in which the plans invest  independent market forecasts and economic and capital market conditions 
sensitivity analysis for us plans which represent the primary portion of obligations is as follows year ended december  net benefit cost income expense as of december  benefit obligation increase decrease dollars in millions one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease pension plan us discount rate expected long term return on assets medical and dental plan us discount rate expected health care cost trend rate initial and ultimate impairment of long lived and other assets property and equipment and intangible assets  net in accordance with provision of asc subtopic  property  plant  and equipment overall and asc subtopic  intangibles goodwill and other general intangibles other than goodwill  the carrying value of long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets and property and equipment  are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
impairment of assets with definite lives is generally determined by comparing projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset  or appropriate grouping of assets  to its carrying value 
indefinite lived intangible asset are tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value below its carrying value 
if an 
table of contents impairment is identified  a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset net book value over its fair value  and the cost basis is adjusted 
determining the extent of an impairment  if any  typically requires various estimates and assumptions including using management judgment  cash flows directly attributable to the asset  the useful life of the asset and residual value  if any 
when necessary  hospira uses internal cash flow estimates  quoted market prices and appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
in addition  the remaining useful life of the impaired asset is revised  if necessary 
hospira reports assets and related liabilities held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated net realizable value 
goodwill in accordance with the provisions of asc subtopic  intangibles goodwill and other goodwill goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
hospira reporting units are the us  canada  latin america  emea and apac 
the evaluation is based upon the estimated fair value of hospira reporting units compared to the net carrying value of assets and liabilities 
hospira uses internal discounted cash flow estimates and market value comparisons to determine estimated fair value 
the annual assessment occurs in the third quarter of each year 
as of the latest assessment  no impairment was indicated 
investments hospira regularly reviews its investments to determine whether an impairment or other than temporary decline in market value exists 
hospira considers factors affecting the investee  factors affecting the industry the investee operates in and general equity market trends 
hospira considers the length of time an investment market value has been below carrying value and the prospects for recovery to carrying value 
when hospira determines that an impairment or other than temporary decline has occurred  the carrying basis of the investment is written down to fair value and the amount of the write down is included in other expense income  net 
see note for more details 
loss contingencies in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  contingencies  loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management best estimate of a loss  or when a best estimate cannot be made  a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded 
these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information is known 
accordingly  if hospira is initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss  the minimum amount  which could be zero  is recorded 
income taxes hospira provision for income taxes is based on taxable income at statutory tax rates in effect in the various jurisdictions in which hospira operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and in evaluating tax positions that are subject to audits and adjustments 
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are established when  despite hospira belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions are likely to be challenged based on the applicable tax authority determination of the positions 
such liabilities are based on management judgment  utilizing internal and external tax advisors and represent management best estimate as to the likely outcome of tax audits 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of changes to unrecognized tax benefits 
each quarter  hospira reviews the anticipated mix of income derived from the various taxing jurisdictions and its associated liabilities in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  income taxes  asc  including the provisions of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at the enacted statutory rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid 
provision for income taxes and foreign 
table of contents withholding taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries when hospira intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely to fund foreign acquisitions or meet working capital and plant and equipment acquisition needs

risk factors  to this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instrument and risk management hospira operates globally  and earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
upon consideration of management objectives  costs and opportunities  hospira uses derivative instruments  including foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to manage these risks 
hospira enters into derivative instrument contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions to limit the amount of credit exposure to nonperformance by any one institution 
hospira does not utilize derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency sensitive financial instruments hospira operations are exposed to currency exchange rate risk  which is mitigated by hospira use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts 
the objective is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
currency exposures primarily in euros  australian dollars  canadian dollars and british pounds include foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency revenue and expenses  including inter company payables  receivables and loans 
these forward contracts are not designated as hedges in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  derivatives and hedging  and  therefore  changes in the fair value are recognized in earnings in other expense income  net  during the term of the forward contract 
as of december   hospira had million net notional value of forward contracts purchased primarily dominated in euros  australian dollars  canadian dollars and british pounds that mature within one to six months 
net forward contract income for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the carrying value and fair value of forward contracts was a net payable of million and net receivable of million as of december  and  respectively 
as part of its risk management program  hospira performs a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  and  while not predictive in nature  indicated that if the us dollar uniformly fluctuates unfavorably by against all currencies  the net liability balance of million would increase by million 
the sensitivity analysis recalculates the fair value of the foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  by replacing the actual exchange rates at december  
table of contents with exchange rates that are unfavorable to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency 
all other factors are held constant 
the sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency 
the analysis also disregards the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances 
interest rate sensitive financial instruments hospira primary interest rate exposures relate to cash and cash equivalents  and fixed and variable rate debt 
the objective in managing exposure to changes in interest rates is to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flows associated with these changes 
hospira utilizes a mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage changes in interest rates 
in  hospira entered into interest rate swap contracts whereby million of the million principal amount of note due june and million of the million principal amount of note due in may were effectively converted from fixed to floating rate debt 
as part of its risk management program  hospira performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings relating to hypothetical movements in interest rates associated with outstanding interest rates swap contracts 
a basis point change in interest rates affecting hospira interest rate swap contracts  would have an immaterial effect on the annual earnings over the term of the related instruments 
hospira investment portfolio of million at december   consists of cash and cash equivalents  equity investments in affiliated companies and marketable and cost method investments 
marketable investments consist of marketable securities classified as available for sale 
the carrying value of the investment portfolio approximates fair market value at december   and the value at maturity  as the majority of investments consist of securities with maturities of less than three months 
because hospira investments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  a hypothetical one percentage point increase decrease in interest rates  based on average cash and cash equivalents during the year  would increase decrease interest income by approximately million 
hospira has a revolver that allows borrowings up to million for general corporate purposes at variable interest rates 
the amount of available borrowings under the revolver may be increased to a maximum of million  under certain circumstances 
as of december   hospira has not borrowed any amounts under the revolver
