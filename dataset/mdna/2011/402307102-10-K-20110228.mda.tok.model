item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and outlook our results of operations are affected primarily by i the level of exploration and development activity maintained by oil and gas exploration and production companies in the gulf of mexico  and to a lesser extent  foreign locations throughout the world  ii our ability to win contracts through competitive bidding or alliance partnering arrangements  and iii our ability to manage those contracts to successful completion 
the level of exploration and development activity is related to several factors  including trends in oil and gas prices  expectations of future oil and gas prices  changes in technology and changes in the regulatory environment  including new permitting processes and increased regulation imposed on domestic oil and gas exploration by the bureau of ocean energy  regulation and enforcement 
we believe the downturn in the oil and gas industry that began in late brought on by the rapid decline in oil and gas prices adversely impacted our business during and  but will begin to reverse in oil prices have continued to increase since they fell below a barrel in early and are now to a barrel and could possibly increase further 
as a result  the ability of oil and gas producers to raise capital has improved and bidding activity  particularly for deepwater projects  has increased 
we believe margins will begin to improve as production volumes increase based on projects currently in our backlog 
cost reduction measures were taken during the last two years and will continue to be monitored as production levels increase 
we will continue to focus on managing the increasing costs of raw materials and restoring our labor force 
in the longer term  demand for our products and services will continue to depend largely upon prices for oil and gas and our customer s cost of regulatory compliance  which at this time is difficult to predict 
however  we believe current oil prices will be maintained and supported by domestic and foreign demand and as the changing domestic regulatory environment can be managed profitably by our customers 
backlog our backlog is based on management s estimate of the direct labor hours required to complete  and the remaining revenue to be recognized with respect to  those projects as to which a customer has authorized us to begin work or purchase materials pursuant to written contracts  letters of intent or other forms of authorization 
often  however  management s estimates are based on incomplete engineering and design specifications 
as engineering and design plans are finalized or changes to existing plans are made  management s estimate of the direct labor hours required to complete and price at completion is likely to change 
in addition  all projects currently included in our backlog are subject to termination at the option of the customer  although the customer  in that case  is generally required to pay us for work performed and materials purchased through the date of termination and  in some instances  cancellation fees 
in addition  a customer can potentially delay the execution of their project 
as of december   we had a revenue backlog of million and a labor backlog of approximately million man hours remaining to work  which consists of work remaining at december  and commitments received through february   compared to the revenue backlog of million and a labor backlog of million man hours reported as of december  our backlog as of december  includes amounts associated with a contract for the fabrication and integration of the topsides on a deepwater gulf of mexico project we received and announced on november  of the backlog at december   represents projects for one major global oil and gas company 
of the backlog at december   million  or  represented projects destined for deepwater locations compared to million  or  of projects destined for deepwater locations included in the december  backlog 
depending on the size of the project  the termination or postponement of any one of our deepwater projects could significantly reduce our backlog  and could have a material adverse effect on revenue  net income and cash flow 

table of contents of the backlog at december   we expect to recognize revenues of approximately million during calendar year  million during calendar year and the remaining million thereafter 
workforce during  our workforce ranged from approximately  to  demand for our products and services dictates our workforce needs 
although we generally try to minimize the use of contract labor  we will use contract labor when required to meet customer demand 
for  our use of contract labor ranged from approximately to contract laborers 
the workforce was reduced during as a cost reduction measure 
due to the recent award of significant contracts  we will again focus on hiring employees in to meet the increasing level of activity 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis based on the ratio of direct labor hours actually performed to date compared to the total estimated direct labor hours required for completion 
accordingly  contract price and cost estimates are reviewed monthly as the work progresses  and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in revenue for the period when such estimates are revised 
if these adjustments were to result in a reduction of previously reported profits  we would have to recognize a charge against current earnings  which may be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
some contracts include a total or partial reimbursement to us of any costs associated with specific capital projects required by the fabrication process 
if a particular capital project provides future benefits to us  the cost to build the capital project will be capitalized  and the revenue for the capital project will increase the estimated profit in the contract 
contract costs include all direct material  labor and subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies and tools 
also included in contract costs are a portion of those indirect contract costs related to plant capacity  such as depreciation  insurance and repairs and maintenance 
these indirect costs are allocated to jobs based on actual direct labor hours incurred 
profit incentives are included in revenue when their realization is probable 
claims for extra work or changes in scope of work are included in revenue when the amount can be reliably estimated and collection is probable 
no revenues were recorded at december  related to unapproved change orders 
we had  of change orders  approved as to scope but not price  recorded at december  that were approved in the first quarter of we had million of change orders  related to re measure issues primarily involving one customer  recorded at december  these issues were settled and resulted in the recognition of an additional  of revenue in the first quarter of provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
we recognized contract losses of million  million  and million in the years ended december    and  respectively 

table of contents results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and for the twelve month period ended december   our revenue was million  a decrease of  compared to million in revenue for the twelve month period ended december  the following factors contributed to the decrease in revenues for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  man hours worked have decreased from million for the twelve month period ended december  to million during the twelve month period ended december   representing a decrease of 
the most significant impact of the reduction in man hours worked was to our texas facility which is a direct result of the reduction in new job awards for deepwater projects 
since  the majority of the work performed at our texas facility was on larger deepwater projects 
the mindoc hull was the last large deepwater project fabricated in our texas facility and it sailed in november until november   the fabrication awards for the facility have been limited to large diameter tanks  multi size modules and a  ton lifting system 
consequently  the decrease in activity at our texas facility during contributed to the majority of the decrease in man hours 
for the twelve month periods ended december  and  gross profit was million of revenue for and million of revenue for the low level of production man hours at our texas facility during did not allow us to cover certain fixed costs  which contributed to the decrease in gross margin 
although we reduced costs at the facility  certain fixed costs could not be eliminated 
with the recent award of the contract for the fabrication and integration of the topsides on a deepwater gulf of mexico project  as evidenced in backlog  in we anticipate gross margins will improve as the man hours worked increase at our texas facility 
our general and administrative expenses were million for the twelve month period ended december  this compares to million for the twelve month period ended december  although the absolute dollar value was less  the percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were of revenue compared to of revenue for the twelve month periods ended december  and  respectively 
the reduction in general and administrative expenses for the twelve month period ended december  compared to december  was primarily due to a reduction in the number of personnel and related cost salaries  wages and benefit related costs 
also contributing to the reduction of general and administrative costs was a reduction in professional service fees 
we had net interest income of million for the twelve month period ended december   compared to net interest income of  for the twelve month period ended december  the increase in interest income is primarily related to interest income recognized with respect to the financing arrangement with bluewater and atp on the fabrication of the mindoc i project 
on november   we sold the limited overriding royalty interest with respect to this arrangement to an undisclosed buyer 
see note to in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we had other income of million for the twelve months ended december   compared to a  loss for the twelve months ended december  the increase in other income is a result of the settlement of claims related to damages incurred in connection with the hurricanes that hit the gulf coast in our effective rate was for the twelve month period ended december   compared to for the twelve month period ended december  the increase relates primarily to the federal work opportunity tax credits wotc available to us in  which were no longer available in  a decrease in the federal qualified production activities income deduction due to a decrease in activity at our texas facility  
table of contents and an increase in louisiana state income tax apportionments for we believe in our effective tax rate will decrease with the expected increase in activity at our texas facility and  as a result  the increase in the federal qualified production activities income deduction 
comparison of the years ended december  and for the twelve month period ended december   our revenue was million  a decrease of  compared to million in revenue for the twelve month period ended december  the following factors contributed to the decrease in revenue for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  lack of jobs added to the backlog for several quarters 
pass through cost decreased from of revenue for the twelve month period ended december  to for the twelve month period ended december   see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the amount of man hours worked decreased from million for the twelve month period ended december  to million during the twelve month period ended december   representing a decrease of we had  of change orders  approved as to scope but not price  recorded at december  that were approved in the first quarter of we had million of change orders  related to re measure issues primarily involving one customer  recorded at december  these issues were settled and resulted in the recognition of an additional  of revenue in the first quarter of for the twelve month periods ended december  and  gross profit was million of revenue for and million of revenue for the following factors contributed to the increase in gross margin percentage for the twelve months ended december  activity levels in allowed us to decrease our reliance on contract labor used to supplement our labor force necessary to complete the major projects in progress 
generally  contract labor employees perform less efficiently than company employees  which is normally due to the amount of training  work experience and turnover 
during  our weighted average number of contract employees was employees compared to contract employees for  a reduction of 
during the twelve months ended december   contract labor represented of man hours worked  compared to for the twelve months ended december  as of december   the total number of contract employees in all facilities is cost reduction measures  including a reduction in overhead labor costs  were undertaken since the fourth quarter of to meet the decline in economic conditions we experienced beginning in our general and administrative expenses were million for the twelve month period ended december  this compares to million for the twelve month period ended december  as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were of revenue compared to of revenue for the twelve month periods ended december  and the reduction in general and administrative expenses for the twelve month period ended december  compared to december  was primarily due to a reduction in the number of personnel and related cost salaries  wages and benefit related costs 
also contributing to the reduction of general and administrative costs was a reduction in professional service fees 
we had net interest income of  for the twelve month period ended december   compared to net interest income of  for the twelve month period ended december  the increase in interest income is primarily related to the amortization of the discount associated with the financing arrangement with bluewater and atp on the fabrication of the mindoc i project  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents our effective income tax rate was for the twelve month period ended december   compared to for the twelve month period ended december  the increase from the previous twelve month period is the result of the limitations on certain federal manufacturing tax credits based on our estimated tax provision for  a reduction in the federal work opportunity tax credit wotc available to us in and a slight increase in state taxes related to an increase in the state taxable income apportionment 
liquidity and capital resources historically we have funded our business activities through funds generated from operations 
effective july   we entered into the ninth amendment to the ninth amended and restated credit agreement the revolver which  among other things  extended the term of the million revolver from december  to december  the revolver is secured by some of our real estate  machinery and equipment  and fixtures 
amounts borrowed under the revolver bear interest  at our option  at the prime lending rate established by jpmorgan chase bank  na or libor plus 
we pay a fee on a quarterly basis of one fourth of one percent per annum on the weighted average unused portion of the revolver 
at december   no amounts were borrowed under the revolver  but we had letters of credit outstanding totaling million 
as of february   million of these letters of credit outstanding expired  which increased the unused portion of the revolver to million 
we are required to maintain certain covenants  including balance sheet and cash flow ratios 
as of december   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
working capital was million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was due to an improvement in our net contract position of million for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  the change in net contract position primarily resulted from our collection of the remaining million on the mindoc project during the twelve months ended december  changes to our contract position include changes in contracts receivable  contract retainage  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  accounts payable  and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts 
an overall positive increase in these contract related accounts represents more cash on hand for future working capital needs and less cash utilized by contracts in progress partially offsetting the change in our net contract position was our earnings decrease of million for the twelve months ending december   compared to the twelve months ending december   due to the decrease in man hours worked 
the amount of man hours worked was million during the twelve month period ending december  as compared to million for the twelve month period ending december  net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   was million  which related to capital expenditures for equipment and improvements to our production facilities 
included in capital expenditures for the twelve months ended december  was million for a fabrication shop and warehouse in the west yard of our gulf island facility to support our increase in marine activities 
also included in capital expenditures for the period was million representing approximately one half of the cost of constructing a gate for the graving dock at our gulf marine facilities 
the graving dock gate is expected to be completed in the late first quarter or early second quarter of we anticipate capital expenditures for to be approximately million for the purchase of equipment and additional yard and facility infrastructure improvements  including million for the completion of the graving dock gate located in our gulf marine facilities 
the gate will allow us to open and 
table of contents close the entrance of the graving dock within a few days as opposed to a few weeks 
we believe the new gate will improve our efficiency and enhance services to our customers through a shorter dock turn around 
also included is million for two manitowac cranes  each with a lifting capacity of tons  for our gulf marine facilities 
these cranes were delivered in the first quarter of this additional lifting capacity creates greater efficiencies as we work on future deepwater projects 
in addition  million is included for six additional kamag type modular transporters to be delivered to our gulf island facilities in the third quarter of these additional transporters will create more scheduling flexibility for our customers and provide additional efficiencies during project assembly and load out 
the  of net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  included  of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and  of excess tax benefits associated with the share based payment arrangements less  in payments of dividends on common stock 
we believe that for the next twelve months  our cash on hand  our cash generated by operating activities and funds available under the revolver will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and meet our working capital needs 
however  job awards may require us to issue additional letters of credit further reducing the capacity available on our revolver 
we may also expand our operations through acquisitions in the future  which may require additional equity or debt financing which we believe would be available to us  however  there can be no assurance that amounts will be available on commercial terms acceptable to us 
the following table sets forth an aggregation of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december   in thousands 
total less than year to years to years thereafter purchase commitment equipment purchase commitment material and services purchase commitment equipment is a commitment related to purchase order agreements 
purchase commitment material and services is a commitment related to purchase order agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not a party to any contract or other obligation not included in our balance sheet that has  or is reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have operations subject to material risk of foreign currency fluctuations  nor do we use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investment portfolio 
we have a million line of credit with our primary commercial banks 
under the terms of the revolver  we may elect to pay interest at either a fluctuating base rate established by the bank from time to time or at a rate based on the rate established in the london inter bank market 
we do not believe that we have any material exposure to market risk associated with interest rates
