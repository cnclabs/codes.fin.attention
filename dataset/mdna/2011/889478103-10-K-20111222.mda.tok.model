overview our business we design  build  market and arrange financing for single family detached and attached homes in luxury residential communities 
we are also involved  directly and through joint ventures  in projects where we are building  or converting existing rental apartment buildings into  high  mid and low rise luxury homes 
at october   we were operating in states 
in the five years ended october   we delivered  homes from communities  including  homes from communities in fiscal in addition  through our subsidiary gibraltar capital and asset management llc gibraltar  we invest in distressed real estate opportunities which may be different than our traditional homebuilding operations 
fiscal financial highlights in the twelve month period ended october   we recognized billion of revenues and net income of million  as compared to billion of revenues and a net loss of million in fiscal fiscal income included million of inventory impairments and write offs  million of impairment charges related to our investments in unconsolidated entities  million of expenses related to repurchases of our debt  and an income tax benefit of million 
the fiscal loss included inventory impairments and write offs of million  million of expenses related to repurchases of our debt  and an income tax benefit of million 
at october   we had billion of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand and approximately million available under our million revolving credit facility which matures in october during fiscal  we used available cash to repurchase or redeem million of our senior notes 
between october  and october   we increased our cash position including marketable securities by approximately million and reduced debt by approximately million 
recent development in november  we acquired substantially all of the assets of camwest development llc 
camwest develops a variety of home types  including luxury single family homes  condominiums  and townhomes throughout the seattle  washington metropolitan area  primarily in king and snohomish counties 
for calendar year  camwest expected to deliver approximately homes and produce revenues of approximately million 
the assets we acquired included approximately  home sites owned and home sites controlled through land purchase agreements 
the acquisition increased our selling community count by communities 
our challenging business environment and current outlook the ongoing downturn in the us housing market  which began in the fourth quarter of our fiscal  has been the longest and most severe since the great depression 
the value of our net contracts signed in fiscal was billion  a decline of from the billion of net contracts signed in fiscal the downturn  which we believe started with a decline in consumer confidence  an overall softening of demand for new homes and an oversupply of homes available for sale  has been exacerbated by  among other things  a decline in the overall economy  increased unemployment  the increased number of vacant homes  fear of job loss  a decline in home prices and the resulting reduction in home equity  the large number of homes that are vacant and homes that are or will be available due to foreclosures  the inability of some of our home buyers or some prospective buyers of their homes to sell their current home  and the direct and indirect impact of the turmoil in the mortgage loan market 
we continue to believe that many of our markets and housing in general have reached bottom  however  we expect that there may be more periods of volatility in the future 
our target customers generally have remained employed during this downturn 
many have deferred their home buying decisions  however  because of concerns over the direction of the economy and media headlines suggesting that home prices continue to decline 
we continue to believe that  once the economy and consumer confidence improve and the unemployment rate declines  pent up demand will be released and  gradually  more buyers will enter the market 
we continue to believe that the key to a full recovery in our business depends on these factors as well as a sustained stabilization of financial markets and home prices 

table of contents we also believe that the medium and long term futures for us and the homebuilding industry are bright 
a harvard university study projects that under both low and high growth scenarios  housing demand in the period should exceed that of the previous three decades 
in many markets  the pipeline of approved and improved home sites has dwindled as builders and developers have lacked both the capital and the economic benefit for bringing sites through approvals 
therefore  when demand picks up  builders and developers with approved land in well located markets will be poised to benefit 
we believe that this will be particularly true for us because our land portfolio is heavily weighted in the metro washington  dc to metro boston corridor where land is scarce  approvals are more difficult to obtain and overbuilding has been relatively less prevalent than in the southeast and western regions 
we continue to seek a balance between our short term goal of selling homes in a tough market and our long term goal of maximizing the value of our communities 
we continue to believe that many of our communities are in desirable locations that are difficult to replace and in markets where approvals have been increasingly difficult to obtain 
we believe that many of these communities have substantial embedded value that may be realized in the future and that this value should not necessarily be sacrificed in the current soft market 
competitive landscape based on our experience during prior downturns in the housing industry  we believe that attractive land acquisition opportunities arise in difficult times for those builders that have the financial strength to take advantage of them 
in the current challenging environment  we believe our strong balance sheet  liquidity  access to capital  broad geographic presence  diversified product line  experienced personnel and national brand name all position us well for such opportunities now and in the future 
we continue to see reduced competition from the small and mid sized private builders that had been our primary competitors in the luxury market 
we believe that many of these builders are no longer in business and that access to capital by the surviving private builders is already severely constrained 
we envision that there will be fewer and more selective lenders serving our industry when the market rebounds and that those lenders likely will gravitate to the homebuilding companies that offer them the greatest security  the strongest balance sheets and the broadest array of potential business opportunities 
we believe that this reduced competition  combined with attractive long term demographics  will reward those well capitalized builders that can persevere through the current challenging environment 
as market conditions improve over time  we believe that geographic and product diversification  access to lower cost capital and strong demographics will benefit those builders  like us who can control land and persevere through the increasingly difficult regulatory approval process 
we believe that these factors favor the large publicly traded homebuilding companies with the capital and expertise to control home sites and gain market share 
we also believe that over the past five years  many builders and land developers reduced the number of home sites that were taken through the approval process 
the process continues to be difficult and lengthy  and the political pressure from no growth proponents continues to increase  but we believe our expertise in taking land through the approval process and our already approved land positions will allow us to grow in the years to come  as market conditions improve 
land acquisition and development because of the length of time that it takes to obtain the necessary approvals on a property  complete the land improvements on it  and deliver a home after a home buyer signs an agreement of sale  we are subject to many risks 
in certain cases  we attempt to reduce some of these risks by utilizing one or more of the following methods controlling land for future development through options also referred to herein as land purchase contracts or option and purchase agreements  thus allowing the necessary governmental approvals to be obtained before acquiring title to the land  generally commencing construction of a detached home only after executing an agreement of sale and receiving a substantial down payment from the buyer  and using subcontractors to perform home construction and land development work on a fixed price basis 
our risk reduction strategy of generally not commencing the construction of a detached home until we have an agreement of sale with a buyer was effective prior to this current downturn in the housing market  but  due to the number of cancellations of agreements of sale that we had during fiscal  and  many of which were for homes on which we had commenced construction  the number of homes under construction in detached single family communities for which we did not have an agreement of sale increased from our historical levels 
with our contract cancellation rates returning to more normal levels in fiscal and  and the sale of these units  we have reduced the number of unsold units to more historical levels 
in addition  over the past several years  the number of our attached home communities has grown  resulting in an increase in the number of unsold units under construction 

table of contents in response to the decline in market conditions over the past several years  we have re evaluated and renegotiated or cancelled many of our land purchase contracts 
in addition  we have sold  and may continue to sell  certain parcels of land that we have identified as non strategic 
as a result  we reduced our land position from a high of approximately  home sites at april   to approximately  home sites at october  we continue to position ourselves for the anticipated recovery through the opportunistic and  we believe  prudent purchase of land and the continued growth of our community count 
based on our belief that the housing market has bottomed  the increased attractiveness of land available for purchase and the revival of demand in certain areas  we have begun to increase our land positions 
during fiscal and fiscal  we acquired control of approximately  home sites net of options terminated and  home sites net of options terminated  respectively 
of the  home sites controlled at october   we owned approximately  of these  home sites  significant improvements were completed on approximately  of them 
at october   we were selling from communities  compared to and communities at october  and  respectively 
our november acquisition of camwest assets further increases the number of our home sites controlled and our selling community count 
we expect to be selling from to communities at october  in addition  at october   we had communities that were temporarily closed due to market conditions  none of which we expect to reopen prior to october  availability of customer mortgage financing we maintain relationships with a widely diversified group of mortgage financial institutions  many of which are among the largest and  we believe  most reliable in the industry 
we believe that regional and community banks continue to recognize the long term value in creating relationships with high quality  affluent customers such as our home buyers  and these banks continue to provide such customers with financing 
we believe that our home buyers generally are  and should continue to be  better able to secure mortgages due to their typically lower loan to value ratios and attractive credit profiles as compared to the average home buyer 
nevertheless  in recent years  tightened credit standards have shrunk the pool of potential home buyers and hindered accessibility of or eliminated certain loan products previously available to our home buyers 
our home buyers continue to face stricter mortgage underwriting guidelines  higher down payment requirements and narrower appraisal guidelines than in the past 
in addition  some of our home buyers continue to find it more difficult to sell their existing homes as prospective buyers of their homes may face difficulties obtaining a mortgage 
in addition  other potential buyers may have little or negative equity in their existing homes and may not be able to or willing to purchase a larger or more expensive home 
while the range of mortgage products available to a potential home buyer is not what it was in  we have seen improvements over the past year 
indications from industry participants  including commercial banks  mortgage banks  mortgage reits and mortgage insurance companies are that availability  parameters and pricing of jumbo loans are all improving 
we believe that improvement should not only enhance financing alternatives for existing jumbo buyers  but should help to offset the reduction in fannie mae freddie mac eligible loan amounts in some markets 
based on the mortgages provided by our mortgage subsidiary during fiscal  we do not expect the change in the fannie mae freddie mac eligible loan amounts to have a significant impact on our business 
there has been significant media attention given to mortgage put backs  a practice by which a buyer of a mortgage loan tries to recoup losses from the loan originator 
we do not believe this is a material issue for our mortgage subsidiary 
of the approximately  loans sold by our mortgage subsidiary since november   only have been the subject of either actual indemnification payments or take backs or contingent liability loss provisions related thereto 
we believe that this is due to i our typical home buyer s financial position and sophistication  ii on average  our home buyers who use mortgage financing to purchase a home pay approximately of the purchase price in cash  iii our general practice of not originating certain loan types such as option adjustable rate mortgages and down payment assistance products  and our origination of very few sub prime  high loan to value and no documentation loans and iv our elimination of early payment default provisions from each of our agreements with our mortgage investors several years ago 

table of contents the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act provides for a number of new requirements relating to residential mortgage lending practices  many of which are subject to further rule making 
these include  among others  minimum standards for mortgages and related lender practices  the definitions and parameters of a qualified mortgage and a qualified residential mortgage  future risk retention requirements  limitations on certain fees  prohibition of certain tying arrangements  and remedies for borrowers in foreclosure proceedings in the event that a lender violates fee limitations or minimum standards 
the ultimate effect of such provisions on lending institutions  including our mortgage subsidiary  will depend on the rules that are ultimately promulgated 
gibraltar we continue to look for other distressed real estate opportunities through gibraltar 
gibraltar continues to selectively review a steady flow of new opportunities  including fdic and bank portfolios and other distressed real estate investments 
in september   gibraltar acquired three portfolios of non performing loans consisting of loans with an unpaid principal balance of approximately million 
the portfolios include residential acquisition  development  and construction loans secured by properties at various stages of completion 
in march  gibraltar acquired a participation in a portfolio of non performing loans with outstanding principal balances aggregating approximately million 
the portfolio consists primarily of residential acquisition  development and construction loans secured by properties at various stages of completion 
gibraltar oversees the day to day management of the portfolio in accordance with the business plans which are jointly approved by gibraltar and the co participant 
in fiscal  gibraltar acquired an interest in four properties through foreclosure or obtaining deeds in lieu of foreclosure related to this loan portfolio 
at october   gibraltar s pro rata share of the carrying value of these properties was million 
in july  gibraltar invested in a joint venture in which it is a participant with two unrelated parties to purchase a interest in an entity that owned a billion face value fdic portfolio of former amtrust bank assets 
during the fiscal  we recognized million of income from the gibraltar operations 
contracts and backlog the aggregate value of gross sales contracts signed increased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and decreased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the value of gross sales contracts signed was billion  homes in fiscal  billion  homes in fiscal and billion  homes in fiscal the increase in the aggregate value of gross contracts signed in the fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the result of a increase in the number of gross contracts signed  and a increase in the average value of each contract signed 
the increase in the number of gross contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to the increase in the number of selling communities in fiscal the decrease in the aggregate value of gross contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the result of a decrease in the number of gross contracts signed  offset  in part  by a slight increase in the average value of each contract signed 
in fiscal   and  home buyers cancelled million homes  million homes  million homes and million homes of signed contracts  respectively 
as a percentage of the number of gross contracts signed in fiscal   and  home buyers cancelled   and  in those respective years  and   and of the value of gross contracts signed in those respective years 
our contract cancellation rates in fiscal and have been comparable to the cancellation rates prior to fiscal the aggregate value of net contracts signed increased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the value of net contracts signed was billion  homes in fiscal  billion  homes in fiscal and billion  homes in fiscal the increase in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the result of a increase in the number of net contracts signed  and a increase in the average value of each contract signed 
the increase in the number of contracts signed in fiscal was primarily due to the increased number of communities that we had open for sale in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the aggregate value of net contracts signed increased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the result of a increase in the number of net contracts signed and a increase in the average value of each contract signed 
the increase in the number of net contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to the significant decline in contract cancellations in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in the average value of net contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to a lower average value of the contracts cancelled in fiscal  as compared to the average value of contracts cancelled in fiscal  and lower sales incentives given to home buyers in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  offset  in part  by a shift in the number of contracts signed to less expensive products in fiscal  as compared to fiscal 
table of contents backlog consists of homes under contract but not yet delivered to our home buyers 
the value of our backlog at october   and was million  homes  million  homes and million  homes  respectively 
the and increase in the value and number of homes of backlog at october  as compared the october   was due to the increase in the number and the average value of net contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal and the decrease in the aggregate value and number of our deliveries in fiscal  as compared to the aggregate value and number of deliveries in fiscal  offset  in part  by the decrease in the value of our backlog at october   as compared to our backlog at october  the decreases in backlog at october   as compared to the backlog at october  and at october   as compared to october   were primarily attributable to the continued decline in the new home market in fiscal and  and the decrease in the value and number of net contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as well as in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  offset  in part  by lower deliveries in both fiscal and  as compared to the preceding fiscal years

critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory inventory is stated at cost unless an impairment exists  in which case it is written down to fair value in accordance with gaap 
in addition to direct land acquisition  land development and home construction costs  costs also include interest  real estate taxes and direct overhead related to development and construction  which are capitalized to inventory during periods beginning with the commencement of development and ending with the completion of construction 
for those communities that have been temporarily closed  no additional capitalized interest is allocated to the community s inventory until it re opens  and other carrying costs are expensed as incurred 
once a parcel of land has been approved for development and we open the community  it can typically take four or more years to fully develop  sell and deliver all the homes 
longer or shorter time periods are possible depending on the number of home sites in a community and the sales and delivery pace of the homes in a community 
our master planned communities  consisting of several smaller communities  may take up to ten years or more to complete 
because our inventory is considered a long lived asset under gaap  we are required to regularly review the carrying value of each of our communities and write down the value of those communities for which we believe the values have been impaired 
current communities when the profitability of a current community deteriorates  the sales pace declines significantly or some other factor indicates a possible impairment in the recoverability of the asset  the asset is reviewed for impairment by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flow for the community to its carrying value 
if the estimated future undiscounted cash flow is less than the community s carrying value  the carrying value is written down to its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is primarily determined by discounting the estimated future cash flow of each community 
the impairment is charged to cost of revenues in the period in which the impairment is determined 
in estimating the future undiscounted cash flow of a community  we use various estimates such as a the expected sales pace in a community  based upon general economic conditions that will have a short term or long term impact on the market in which the community is located and on competition within the market  including the number of home sites available and pricing and incentives being offered in other communities owned by us or by other builders  b the expected sales prices and sales incentives to be offered in a community  c costs expended to date and expected to be incurred in the future  including  but not limited to  land and land development costs  home construction costs  interest costs and overhead costs  d alternative product offerings that may be offered in a community that will have an impact on sales pace  sales price  building cost or the number of homes that can be built in a particular community  and e alternative uses for the property  such as the possibility of a sale of the entire community to another builder or the sale of individual home sites 

table of contents future communities we evaluate all land held for future communities or future sections of current communities  whether owned or optioned  to determine whether or not we expect to proceed with the development of the land as originally contemplated 
this evaluation encompasses the same types of estimates used for current communities described above  as well as an evaluation of the regulatory environment in which the land is located and the estimated probability of obtaining the necessary approvals  the estimated time and cost it will take to obtain those approvals and the possible concessions that will be required to be given in order to obtain them 
concessions may include cash payments to fund improvements to public places such as parks and streets  dedication of a portion of the property for use by the public or as open space or a reduction in the density or size of the homes to be built 
based upon this review  we decide a as to land under contract to be purchased  whether the contract will likely be terminated or renegotiated  and b as to land we own  whether the land will likely be developed as contemplated or in an alternative manner  or should be sold 
we then further determine whether costs that have been capitalized to the community are recoverable or should be written off 
the write off is charged to cost of revenues in the period in which the need for the write off is determined 
the estimates used in the determination of the estimated cash flows and fair value of both current and future communities are based on factors known to us at the time such estimates are made and our expectations of future operations and economic conditions 
should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated fair value deteriorate in the future  we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges and write offs related to current and future communities 
we provided for inventory impairment charges and the expensing of costs that we believed not to be recoverable in each of the three fiscal years ended october   and as shown in the table below amounts in thousands 
land controlled for future communities land owned for future communities operating communities the table below provides  for the periods indicated  the number of operating communities that we tested for potential impairment  the number of operating communities in which we recognized impairment charges  the amount of impairment charges recognized  and  as of the end of the period indicated  the fair value of those communities  net of impairment charges amounts in millions

table of contents variable interest entities we have a significant number of land purchase contracts and several investments in unconsolidated entities which we evaluate in accordance with gaap 
we analyze our land purchase contracts and the unconsolidated entities in which we have an investment to determine whether the land sellers and unconsolidated entities are variable interest entities vies and  if so  whether we are the primary beneficiary 
if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie  we must consolidate it 
a vie is an entity with insufficient equity investment or in which the equity investors lack some of the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary  we consider  among other things  whether we have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  including  but not limited to  determining or limiting the scope or purpose of the vie  selling or transferring property owned or controlled by the vie  or arranging financing for the vie 
we also consider whether we have the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie 
at october   the company had determined that land purchase contracts  with an aggregate purchase price of million  on which we had made aggregate deposits totaling million  were vies  and that we were not the primary beneficiary of any vie related to these land purchase contracts 
income taxes valuation allowance significant judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
in accordance with gaap  a valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized 
the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law 
we periodically assess the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on gaap s more likely than not realization threshold criteria 
in our assessment  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and magnitude of current and cumulative income and losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryback or carryforward periods  our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards being used before expiration  and tax planning alternatives 
our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets includes assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  on business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect our actual tax results and our future business results may affect the amount of our deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of our deferred tax assets over time 
our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events 
due to uncertainties in the estimation process  particularly with respect to changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods carryforward period assumptions  it is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our historical analyses 
our assumptions require significant judgment because the residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
if our results of operations are less than projected and there is insufficient objectively positive verifiable evidence to support the likely realization of our deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance would be required to reduce or eliminate our deferred tax assets 
since the beginning of fiscal  we recorded significant deferred tax assets 
these deferred tax assets were generated primarily by inventory impairments and impairments of investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities 
in accordance with gaap  we assessed whether a valuation allowance should be established based on our determination of whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
we believe that the continued downturn in the housing market  the uncertainty as to its length and magnitude  our continued recognition of impairment charges  and our cumulative operating losses in recent years are significant evidence of the need for a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded valuation allowances against all of our net deferred tax assets 
we are allowed to carry forward tax losses for years and apply such tax losses to future taxable income to realize federal deferred tax assets 
in addition  we will be able to reverse previously recognized valuation allowances during any future period in which we report book income before taxes 
we will continue to review our deferred tax assets in accordance with gaap 

table of contents on november   the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of the act was enacted into law 
the act amended section of the internal revenue code to allow net operating losses realized in a tax year ending after december  and beginning before january  to be carried back for up to five years such losses were previously limited to a two year carryback 
this change allowed us to carry back our fiscal taxable losses to prior years and receive a tax refund of million which was received in the second quarter of fiscal we had recorded an expected refund of million in our october  consolidated financial statements 
for state tax purposes  due to past losses and projected future losses in certain jurisdictions where we do not have carryback potential and or cannot sufficiently forecast future taxable income  we recognized net cumulative valuation allowances against our state deferred tax assets of million as of october  and million as of october  future valuation allowances in these jurisdictions may continue to be recognized if we believe we will not generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize future state deferred tax assets 
revenue and cost recognition the construction time of our homes is generally less than one year  although some homes may take more than one year to complete 
revenues and cost of revenues from these home sales are recorded at the time each home is delivered and title and possession are transferred to the buyer 
closing normally occurs shortly after construction is substantially completed 
for our standard attached and detached homes  land  land development and related costs  both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future  are amortized to the cost of homes closed based upon the total number of homes to be constructed in each community 
any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs subsequent to the commencement of delivery of homes are allocated to the remaining undelivered homes in the community 
home construction and related costs are charged to the cost of homes closed under the specific identification method 
the estimated land  common area development and related costs of master planned communities  including the cost of golf courses  net of their estimated residual value  are allocated to individual communities within a master planned community on a relative sales value basis 
any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs are allocated to the remaining home sites in each of the communities of the master planned community 
for high rise mid rise projects  land  land development  construction and related costs  both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future  are generally amortized to the cost of units closed based upon an estimated relative sales value of the units closed to the total estimated sales value 
any changes resulting from a change in the estimated total costs or revenues of the project are allocated to the remaining units to be delivered 
forfeited customer deposits are recognized in other income in the period in which we determine that the customer will not complete the purchase of the home and we have the right to retain the deposit 
sales incentives in order to promote sales of our homes  we grant our home buyers sales incentives from time to time 
these incentives will vary by type of incentive and by amount on a community by community and home by home basis 
incentives that impact the value of the home or the sales price paid  such as special or additional options  are generally reflected as a reduction in sales revenues 
incentives that we pay to an outside party  such as paying some or all of a home buyer s closing costs  are recorded as an additional cost of revenues 
incentives are recognized at the time the home is delivered to the home buyer and we receive the sales proceeds 
off balance sheet arrangements we have investments in and advances to various unconsolidated entities 
at october   we had investments in and advances to these entities  net of impairment charges recognized  of million  and were committed to invest or advance million to these entities if they require additional funding 
the trends  uncertainties or other factors that have negatively impacted our business and the industry in general have also impacted the unconsolidated entities in which we have investments 
we review each of our investments on a quarterly basis for indicators of impairment 
a series of operating losses of an investee  the inability to recover our invested capital  or other factors may indicate that a loss in value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity has occurred 
if a loss exists  we further review to determine if the loss is other than temporary  in which case  we write down the investment to its fair value 
the evaluation of our investment in unconsolidated entities entails a detailed cash flow analysis using many estimates including but not limited to expected sales pace  expected sales prices  expected incentives  costs incurred and anticipated  sufficiency of financing and capital  competition  market conditions and anticipated cash receipts  in order to determine projected future distributions 
each of the unconsolidated entities evaluates its inventory in a similar manner as we do 
see critical accounting policies inventory in this md a for more detailed disclosure on our evaluation of inventory 
if a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity related to its assets  our proportionate share is reflected in loss income from unconsolidated entities with a corresponding decrease to our investment in unconsolidated entities 
during fiscal  based upon our evaluation of the fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities  we determined  due to the continued deterioration of the market in which some of our joint ventures operate  that there was an other than temporary impairment of our investments in these joint ventures 
based on this determination  we recognized million of impairment charges against the carrying value of our investments 

table of contents on october   a bankruptcy court issued an order confirming a plan of reorganization for south edge  llc south edge  a nevada land development joint venture  which was the subject of an involuntary bankruptcy petition filed in december  pursuant to the plan of reorganization  south edge settled litigation regarding a loan made by a syndicate of lenders to south edge having a principal balance of million  for which we had executed certain completion guarantees and conditional repayment guarantees 
the confirmed plan of reorganization provided for a cash settlement to the lenders  the acquisition of land by us and the other members of south edge which are parties to the agreement  and the resolution of all claims between members of the lending syndicate representing of the outstanding amounts due under the loan  the bankruptcy trustee and the members of south edge which are parties to the agreement 
we believe we have made adequate provision at october  for the settlement  including the accrual for our share of the cash payments required under the agreement  any remaining exposure to lenders which are not parties to the agreement and recording impairments to reflect the estimated fair value of land to be acquired 
in november  we made a payment of million as our share of the settlement 
our investments in these entities are accounted for using the equity method 
results of operations the following table compares certain items in our statement of operations for fiscal  and amounts in millions revenues cost of revenues selling  general and administrative interest expense loss from operations other loss income from unconsolidated entities interest and other income expenses related to early retirement of debt loss before income taxes income tax benefit provision net income loss note amounts may not add due to rounding 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal revenues and cost of revenues revenues for fiscal were lower than those for fiscal by approximately million  or 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of homes delivered 
the decrease in the number of homes delivered in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to the lower number of homes in backlog at the beginning of fiscal  as compared to the beginning of fiscal cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal in fiscal and  we recognized inventory impairment charges and write offs of million and million  respectively 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues  excluding impairments  was of revenues in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the decrease in cost of revenues  excluding inventory impairment charges  as a percentage of revenue in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to lower costs  as a percentage of revenues  on the homes delivered in fiscal than those delivered in fiscal the lower percentage was primarily due to the delivery of fewer quick delivery homes in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as our supply of quick delivery homes has dwindled  the reduction in costs realized from our new centralized purchasing initiatives  and reduced costs realized in fiscal because fewer homes were delivered from certain higher cost communities  as compared to fiscal  as these communities delivered their final homes 
generally  the cost  as a percentage of revenues  of a quick delivery home is higher than our standard contract and build homes to be built homes 
the reduction in costs was offset  in part  by higher interest costs in fiscal  as compared to fiscal in fiscal and  interest cost as a percentage of revenues was and  respectively 
the higher interest cost as a percentage of revenue was due to inventory generally being held for a longer period of time and  over the past several years  fewer qualifying assets to which interest can be allocated which resulted in higher amounts of capitalized interest allocated to qualifying inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a decreased by million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenues  sg a was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the increase in sg a  as a percentage of revenues  was due primarily to increased compensation costs and increased sales and marketing costs  offset  in part  by an insurance claim recovery and the reversal of previously accrued costs due to changes in estimates 
the increased compensation and sales and marketing costs were due primarily to the increased number of communities we had open in fiscal  as compared to fiscal interest expense interest incurred on average homebuilding indebtedness in excess of average qualified inventory is charged directly to the statement of operations in the period incurred 
interest expensed directly to the statement of operations in fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the amount of interest expensed directly was due to a higher amount of qualified inventory and a lower amount of debt in fiscal  as compared to fiscal due to the increase in qualified inventory and the decrease of our indebtedness in the last six months of fiscal  we did not have any directly expensed interest in that period 
loss income from unconsolidated entities we are a participant in several joint ventures 
we recognize our proportionate share of the earnings and losses from these entities 
the trends  uncertainties or other factors that have negatively impacted our business and the industry in general and which are discussed in the overview section of this md a have also impacted the unconsolidated entities in which we have investments 
most of our joint ventures are land development projects or high rise mid rise construction projects and do not generate revenues and earnings for a number of years during the development of the property 
once development is complete  the joint ventures will generally  over a relatively short period of time  generate revenues and earnings until all the assets of the entity are sold 
because there is not a steady flow of revenues and earnings from these entities  the earnings recognized from these entities will vary significantly from year to year 
in fiscal  we recognized million of losses from unconsolidated entities  as compared to million of income in fiscal the loss in fiscal included million of impairment charges that we recognized on our investments in unconsolidated entities 
no impairment charges were recognized in fiscal see off balance sheet arrangements in this md a for information related to these impairment charges 
the income from unconsolidated entities in fiscal  excluding the impairment charges recognized  was million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the increase was due principally to higher income generated in fiscal from two of our high rise construction ventures which had significantly more deliveries in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  income generated from our structured asset joint venture and distributions in fiscal from ventures in excess of our cost basis in the ventures of million  offset  in part  by the reversal in fiscal of million of accrued costs related to litigation against us and an unconsolidated entity in which we had an investment  due to settlement of the litigation for an amount that was less than we had previously estimated 

table of contents interest and other income for fiscal and  interest and other income was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in interest and other income in fiscal was primarily due to a decline of million of retained customer deposits in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  offset  in part  by increased management fee income  an increase in interest income and a profit participation received in fiscal from the sale of a non core asset in fiscal  as compared to fiscal expenses related to early retirement of debt in fiscal  we purchased million of our senior notes in the open market at various prices and expensed million related to the premium paid on  and other debt redemption costs of  our senior notes

the large reversal of valuation allowances previously recognized in fiscal was due to our expected recovery of certain deferred tax assets through our ability to carryback fiscal tax losses to prior years and receive a refund of the applicable federal taxes 
the recovery of deferred tax assets principally related to inventory impairments and impairments of investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities recognized for income tax purposes in fiscal that were recognized for book purposes in prior years

table of contents revenues and cost of revenues revenues in fiscal were lower than those in fiscal by approximately million  or 
this decrease was attributable to a decrease in the number of homes delivered and a decrease in the average price of the homes delivered 
the decrease in the number of homes delivered in fiscal was primarily due to a decline in the number of homes in backlog at october   as compared to october   offset  in part  by a increase in the number of net contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the decrease in the average price of the homes delivered in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to a shift in product mix to lower priced product  offset  in part  by a decrease in sales incentives  as a percentage of the homes gross sales price  given on homes closed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal average sales incentives given on homes delivered in fiscal amounted to approximately  per home or of the gross price of the home delivered  as compared to approximately  per home or of the gross price of the home delivered in fiscal the decrease in per home sales incentives in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to lower sales incentives provided on contracts in backlog at october   as compared to value of sales incentives on contracts in backlog at october   and the decrease in sales incentives given on contracts signed in fiscal that were delivered in fiscal  as compared to contracts signed in fiscal and delivered in fiscal cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal in fiscal and  we recognized inventory impairment charges and write offs of million and million  respectively 
interest cost as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the higher interest cost as a percentage of revenue was due to inventory generally being held for a longer period of time  fewer qualifying assets to which interest can be allocated which resulted in higher amounts of capitalized interest allocated to qualifying inventory  and lower average prices of homes delivered 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues  excluding impairments and interest  was of revenues in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal this decline was primarily due to lower incentives given on homes delivered and lower overhead and closing costs  offset  in part  by higher cost of land  land improvement and house construction costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a expense decreased by million  or  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenues  sg a was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the reduction in sg a expense in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to lower compensation and related costs  reduced advertising  promotion and model operating costs  reduced insurance costs and a decrease in the write off of deferred marketing costs related to closed communities 
interest expense interest incurred on average homebuilding indebtedness in excess of average qualified inventory is charged directly to the statement of operations in the period incurred 
interest expensed directly to the statement of operations in fiscal was million  as compared to million in fiscal due to the lower amounts of qualified inventory 
income loss from unconsolidated entities in fiscal  we recognized million of income from unconsolidated entities  as compared to a million loss in fiscal the loss in fiscal included million of impairment charges that we recognized on two of our investments in unconsolidated entities 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed million of accrued costs related to litigation against us and an unconsolidated entity in which we had an investment  due to settlement of the litigation for an amount that was less than we had previously estimated 
interest and other income interest and other income were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in interest and other income in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to declines in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  of million of retained customer deposits and million in interest income 

table of contents expenses related to early retirement of debt in fiscal  we purchased million of our senior notes in open market purchases at various prices and expensed million related to the premium paid and other debt redemption costs of our senior notes and the write off of the unamortized costs related to our revolving credit facility that was terminated in october in fiscal  we redeemed million principal amount of senior subordinated notes  conducted a tender offer for million principal amount of senior notes and incurred million of expenses related to the redemption and the tender offer  representing the call premium  the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and costs incurred to complete the tender offer 
loss before income tax benefit provision in fiscal and  we reported a loss before income tax benefit provision of million and million  respectively 
income tax benefit provision in fiscal and  we recognized an income tax benefit of million and an income tax provision of million  respectively 
excluding the valuation allowances recognized against our federal and state deferred tax assets in fiscal and and recoveries of previously recognized valuation allowances  we recognized a tax benefit in fiscal and of million and million  respectively 
in fiscal and  we recognized million and million of valuation allowance  respectively 
in addition  in fiscal  we reversed million of valuation allowances previously recognized 
the decline in the valuation allowances recognized in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to the decline in the amount of inventory impairments and impairments of investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities recognized in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the reversal of valuation allowances previously recognized in fiscal is due to our expected recovery of certain deferred tax assets through our ability to carryback fiscal tax losses to prior years and receive a refund of the applicable federal taxes 
the recovery of deferred tax assets principally related to inventory impairments and impairments of investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities recognized for income tax purposes in fiscal that were recognized for book purposes in prior years 
see critical accounting policies income taxes valuation allowance  above  for information regarding the valuation allowances against our net deferred tax assets 
excluding valuation adjustments  the difference in the effective tax rate for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to a the reversal in fiscal of million of accruals against potential tax assessments  which were no longer needed due to our settlement of various federal and state audits and the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for federal and state tax purposes  as compared to million in fiscal  b the recording of million of unrecognized tax benefits in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal  c the recognition of million of interest and penalties in fiscal  as compared to million of interest and penalties recognized in fiscal  d the recognition of a million state tax benefit  before valuation allowance  in fiscal  as compared to a million state tax benefit  before valuation allowance  recognized in fiscal  and e the loss of tax credits recognized in years prior to fiscal that were lost due to the elimination of taxable income in those years as a result of the carryback of fiscal tax losses 
the increase in the interest and penalties recognized is due to the increase in number of tax years open to assessment and potential additional taxes due 
the decline in the state tax benefit is due primarily to the decline in the reported loss in fiscal  as compared to fiscal capital resources and liquidity funding for our business has been and continues to be provided principally by cash flow from operating activities before inventory additions  unsecured bank borrowings and the public debt and equity markets 
prior to fiscal  we used our cash flow from operating activities before inventory additions  bank borrowings and the proceeds of public debt and equity offerings to acquire additional land for new communities  fund additional expenditures for land development  fund construction costs needed to meet the requirements of our backlog  invest in unconsolidated entities  purchase our stock and repay debt 
between october  and october   we increased our cash position including marketable securities by approximately million and reduced debt by approximately million 

table of contents at october   we had billion of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand and approximately million available under our million revolving credit facility which extends to october in fiscal  cash flow provided by operating activities was million 
cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was primarily from our earnings before inventory and joint venture impairments  and depreciation and amortization  the receipt of a million federal income tax refund and a decrease in restricted cash  offset  in part  by an increase in inventory 
we used million of cash in our investing activities in fiscal  primarily for investments made in non performing loan portfolios and marketable securities and the purchase of property  construction and office equipment  offset  in part  by the return of investments from unconsolidated entities and from our non performing loan portfolios 
we also used million of cash in financing activities in fiscal  principally for the million redemption of senior notes  the net repayment of million of loans payable and the purchase of million of treasury stock  offset  in part by proceeds received from our stock based benefit plans 
during november and december of  we used million of our available cash for the acquisition of the camwest assets  million to fund the litigation settlement related to south edge and million to fund a new joint venture project in new york city 
at october   we had billion of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand  a decrease of million compared to october  in fiscal  cash flow used in operating activities was million 
cash used in operating activities during fiscal was primarily used to acquire inventory  collateralize approximately million of letters of credit and fund an increase in mortgage loan originations in excess of mortgage loan sales  offset  in part  by cash flow generated from our earnings before inventory impairments  depreciation and amortization 
we used million of cash in our investing activities in fiscal  primarily for investments in marketable securities and for investments made in our unconsolidated entities 
we also used million of cash in financing activities in fiscal  principally for the repayment of our million bank term loan  million for the redemption of senior and senior subordinated notes  and repayment of million of other loans payable  offset  in part  by million of net borrowings on our mortgage company warehouse loan  million of proceeds from stock based benefit plans and million of tax benefits from stock based compensation 
in fiscal  our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by million 
in fiscal  cash flow provided by operating activities was million 
cash provided by operating activities was primarily generated by a reduction in inventory and the receipt of income tax refunds on previously paid taxes  offset  in part  by the payment of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and income tax payments made for the settlement of previously accrued tax audits 
the decreases in inventory  accounts payable and accrued liabilities were primarily due to the decline in our business as previously discussed 
we used million of cash in our investing activities in fiscal  primarily for investments in marketable securities and for investments in our unconsolidated entities 
we also generated a net of million of cash from financing activities in fiscal  principally from the issuance of an aggregate of million principal amount of senior notes in the public debt markets net proceeds amounted to million  million of other borrowings primarily from our mortgage company warehouse loan  and issuance of securities under our stock based benefit plans and the tax benefits of stock based compensation  offset  in part  by the redemption of  and tender for  an aggregate of million principal amount of senior and senior subordinated notes  million of expenses related to such redemption and tender offer  and the repayment of million of other borrowings  of which million was on our mortgage company warehouse loan 
in general  our cash flow from operating activities assumes that  as each home is delivered  we will purchase a home site to replace it 
because we own several years supply of home sites  we do not need to buy home sites immediately to replace those which we deliver 
in addition  we generally do not begin construction of our single family detached homes until we have a signed contract with the home buyer  although in the past several years  due to the high cancellation rate of customer contracts and the increase in the number of attached home communities from which we were operating all of the units of which are generally not sold prior to the commencement of construction  the number of speculative homes in our inventory increased significantly 
should our business remain at its current level or further decline  we believe that our inventory levels would continue to decrease as we complete and deliver the homes under construction but do not commence construction of as many new homes  as we complete the improvements on the land we already own and as we sell and deliver the speculative homes that are currently in inventory  resulting in additional cash flow from operations 
in addition  we might continue to delay or curtail our acquisition of additional land  as we have since the second half of fiscal  which would further reduce our inventory levels and cash needs 
at october   we owned or controlled through options  home sites  as compared to  at october    at october  and  at april   the high point of our home sites owned and controlled 
of the  home sites owned or controlled through options at october   we owned  of our owned home sites  significant improvements were completed on approximately  of them 

table of contents at october   the aggregate purchase price of land parcels under option and purchase agreements was approximately million including million of land to be acquired from joint ventures in which we have invested 
of the million of land purchase commitments  we had paid or deposited million and  if we acquire all of these land parcels  we will be required to pay an additional million 
the purchases of these land parcels are scheduled over the next several years 
we have additional land parcels under option that have been excluded from the aforementioned aggregate purchase amounts since we do not believe that we will complete the purchase of these land parcels and no additional funds will be required from us to terminate these contracts 
during the past several years  we have had a significant amount of cash invested in either short term cash equivalents or short term interest bearing marketable securities 
in addition  we have made a number of investments in unconsolidated entities related to the acquisition and development of land for future home sites or in entities that are constructing or converting apartment buildings into luxury condominiums 
our investment activities related to marketable securities and to investments in and distributions of investments from unconsolidated entities are contained in the consolidated statements of cash flows under cash flow used in investing activities 
in october  we entered into an million revolving credit facility with banks  which extends to october the facility replaced a billion credit facility consisting of a billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a million term loan facility with banks  which extended to march  prior to the closing of the new credit facility  we repaid the term loan under the old credit facility from cash on hand 
at october   we had no outstanding borrowings under the new credit facility but had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
at october   interest would have been payable on borrowings under our credit facility at subject to adjustment based upon our debt rating and leverage ratios above the eurodollar rate or at other specified variable rates as selected by us from time to time 
we are obligated to pay an undrawn commitment fee of subject to adjustment based upon our debt rating and leverage ratios based on the average daily unused amount of the credit facility 
under the terms of the credit facility  we are not permitted to allow our maximum leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement to exceed to  and we are required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth as defined in the credit agreement of approximately billion at october  at october   our leverage ratio was approximately to  and our tangible net worth was approximately billion 
based upon the minimum tangible net worth requirement  our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock was limited to an aggregate amount of approximately million at october  in addition  at october   we had million of letters of credit outstanding with three banks which were not part of our new credit facility  these letters of credit were collateralized by million of cash deposits 
we believe that we will be able to continue to fund our current operations and meet our contractual obligations through a combination of existing cash resources and our existing sources of credit 
due to the deterioration of the credit markets and the uncertainties that exist in the economy and for home builders in general  we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace existing financing or find sources of additional financing in the future 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our estimated contractual payment obligations at october  amounts in millions thereafter total senior notes a loans payable a mortgage company warehouse loan a operating lease obligations purchase obligations b retirement plans c other 
table of contents a amounts include estimated annual interest payments until maturity of the debt 
of the amounts indicated  billion of the senior notes  million of loans payable and million of the mortgage company warehouse loan were recorded on the october  consolidated balance sheet 
b amounts represent our expected acquisition of land under options or purchase agreements and the estimated remaining amount of the contractual obligation for land development agreements secured by letters of credit and surety bonds 
amounts do not include the million payment to acquire substantially all of the assets of camwest and the million payment made to settle the south edge litigation 
c amounts represent our obligations under our deferred compensation and supplemental executive retirement plan and our k salary deferral savings plans 
of the total amount indicated  million was recorded on the october  consolidated balance sheet 
inflation the long term impact of inflation on us is manifested in increased costs for land  land development  construction and overhead 
we generally contract for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin 
accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes will affect our profits 
prior to the current downturn in the economy and the decline in demand for homes  the sales prices of our homes generally increased 
because the sales price of each of our homes is fixed at the time a buyer enters into a contract to purchase a home and because we generally contract to sell our homes before we begin construction  any inflation of costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
we generally attempt to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with our subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
the slowdown in the homebuilding industry over the past several years and the decline in the sales prices of our homes  without a corresponding reduction in the costs  have had an adverse impact on our profitability 
in general  housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates and housing costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect our interest costs 
if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance home purchases  our revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford new homes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates 
we utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair market value of the debt instrument but do affect our earnings and cash flow 
we do not have the obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until we are required to refinance such debt 

table of contents at october   our debt obligations  principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value were as follows amounts in thousands fixed rate debt variable rate debt a weighted weighted average average interest interest fiscal year of maturity amount rate amount rate thereafter discount total fair value at october  a based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at october  and holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each increase in interest rates would increase the interest incurred by us by approximately million per year
