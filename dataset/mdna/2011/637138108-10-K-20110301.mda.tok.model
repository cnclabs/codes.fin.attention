effective july  dodd frank imposes more extensive federal regulatory changes on financial institutions with more than billion in assets 
because the assets of national penn do not exceed billion  dodd frank does not  for example  subject national penn to examination by the consumer financial protection bureau or limit the debit card interchange fees charged by national penn bank 
dodd frank also permanently raised the current standard maximum deposit insurance amount to  the higher coverage limit is intended to enhance the safety and security of all deposit accounts 
gramm leach bliley act the gramm leach bliley act of glba repealed various provisions of the glass steagall act to permit commercial banks to affiliate with investment banks securities firms and insurance related businesses 
amended the bhca to permit qualifying bank holding companies to engage in any type of financial activity 
permits subsidiaries of national banks to engage in a broad range of financial activities that are not permitted for national banks themselves 
the result is that banking companies are generally able to offer a wider range of financial products and services and are more readily able to combine with other types of financial companies  such as securities firms and insurance companies 
glba created a new kind of bank holding company called a financial holding company a fhc that is authorized to engage in any activity that is financial in nature or incidental to financial activities and any activity that the federal reserve determines is complementary to financial activities and does not pose undue risks to the financial system 
a bank holding company qualifies to become a fhc if it files an election with the federal reserve and if each of its depository institution subsidiaries is well capitalized  well managed  and cra rated satisfactory or better 
national penn has not become a fhc 
national penn has  instead  utilized the authority of national banks to create operating subsidiaries to expand its business products and services 
glba also authorizes national banks to create financial subsidiaries 
this is in addition to the present authority of national banks to create operating subsidiaries 
a financial subsidiary is a direct subsidiary of a national bank that satisfies the same conditions as a fhc  plus certain other conditions  and is approved in advance by the occ 
a financial subsidiary can engage in most  but not all  of the activities newly authorized for a fhc 
national penn bank has not created any financial subsidiaries 
in addition  glba includes significant provisions relating to the privacy of consumer and customer information 
these provisions apply to any company the business of which is engaging in activities permitted for a fhc  even if it is not itself an fhc 
thus  they apply to national penn 
glba requires a financial institution to adopt and disclose its privacy policy  give consumers and customers the right to opt out of most disclosures to non affiliated third parties  not disclose any account information to non affiliated third party marketers and follow regulatory standards to protect the security and confidentiality of consumer and customer information 
although the long range effects of glba cannot be predicted  national penn believes glba will continue to narrow the differences and intensify competition among commercial banks  investment banks  insurance firms and other financial services companies 
fair credit reporting act in  the federal banking agencies issued regulations implementing the affiliate marketing provisions added to the fair credit reporting act by the fair and accurate credit transactions act 
the regulations  which carried a mandatory compliance date of october   require a financial institution to provide consumers with notice and an opportunity to opt out before certain information can be received from  or disclosed to  an affiliate for the purpose of making a marketing solicitation 
usa patriot act in recent years  a major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing 
the usa patriot act of the patriot act gave the federal government new powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures  expanded surveillance powers and increased information sharing 
it also substantially broadened the scope of federal anti money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence policies  creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra territorial jurisdiction of the united states 
the united states treasury department has issued a number of regulations to implement various provisions of the patriot act 
these regulations impose obligatio ns on national penn to maintain appropriate policies  procedures and controls to detect  prevent and report potential money laundering and terrorist financing activities and to verify the identity of its customers 
failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing or to comply with all of the relevant laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on national penn s business 
interest on reserves drawing upon its accelerated authority under eesa see troubled asset relief program  below  the federal reserve issued a final rule directing that interest be paid on the required and excess reserve balances held by depository institutions at federal reserve banks 
the regulation became effective with the reserve maintenance period beginning july  fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program national penn has enrolled in the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlg  which was established by the fdic in october as an initiative to counter the then current system wide crisis in the nation financial sector 
the tlg provides two limited guarantee programs 
first  the debt guarantee program dgp guarantees newly issued senior unsecured debt of insured depository institutions and their affiliated bank holding companies 
debt  including promissory notes  commercial paper  inter bank funding  and any unsecured portion of secured debt issued on or before june   is fully protected in the event the issuing institution subsequently fails  or its holding company files for bankruptcy 
the dgp debt guarantee is triggered by payment default rather than bankruptcy or receivership  and short term debt issued for one month or less is not covered 
the dgp guarantee expires on june   even for debt that matures after that date 
fees to participate in the dgp are based on the length to maturity of the debt 
second  the transaction account guarantee program tag guaranteed noninterest bearing transaction accounts  regardless of dollar amount  held by insured depository institutions 
in addition to traditional demand deposit accounts  the tag covers business payroll accounts  low interest now accounts and funds held in trust by attorneys  called iolta accounts 
for tag participants  a basis point annual rate surcharge is added to an institutions current fdic insurance assessment to cover noninterest bearing transaction account amounts over  the fdic terminated the tag as of december  under dodd frank  beginning december   for a two year period  noninterest bearing transaction accounts are fully covered by federal deposit insurance 
coverage applies to all fdic insured depository institutions 
in contrast to the tag  no institution may opt out and low interest now accounts are no longer covered 
on december   congress passed a bill to include iolta accounts within the definitions of non interest bearing transaction accounts 
troubled asset relief program on october   the emergency economic stabilization act eesa was signed into law for the purpose of providing the treasury with the authority and facilities to restore liquidity and stability to the us economy 
central to the eesa is the troubled asset relief program tarp  under which the treasury can purchase troubled assets from any financial institution subject to appropriate terms and conditions that minimize the long term negative impact on us taxpayers 
on october   in a joint statement with the fdic and the federal reserve  the treasury announced the creation of the tarp capital purchase program cpp to enable the treasury to make capital investments in public and private banking institutions 
under cpp  treasury can purchase up to billion of senior preferred shares on standardized terms from qualifying us controlled banks  savings associations  and certain bank and savings and loan holding companies 
a participating institution may sell shares of its senior preferred stock valued between and of its risk weighted assets 
senior preferred stock ranks senior to common stock and pari passu with existing senior preferred stock  is non voting  and is callable at par after three years 
shares of senior prefe rred stock pay a cumulative annual dividend of for the first five years and in later years 
as part of the purchase transaction  the treasury also receives warrants to purchase common stock in the institution equating to of the market price of its investment in the senior preferred stock at the time of issuance 
national penn applied to participate in cpp and received treasury approval to do so 
on december   by letter agreement  which included cpp standardized terms  national penn issued and sold to the treasury i  shares of national penn s series b fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock having a liquidation preference of  per share and ii a warrant to purchase up to  shares of the national penn s common stock  without par value  at an initial exercise price  subject to anti dilution adjustments  of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
the number of shares subject to the warrants was reduced to  in the fourth quarter of rules issued by the treasury and certain provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra require participating institutions  including national penn  to adopt certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the treasury holds cpp senior preferred stock 
under these standards  the amount of bonus and incentive compensation that may be paid each year is limited  incentive compensation must not be designed to encourage executives to take excessive risks or to manipulate earnings  bonuses and incentive compensation based on materially inaccurate financial statements must be returned  golden parachute payments are prohibited  and federal income tax deductions are limited to the first thousand of compensation per individual 
these restrictions generally apply to the chief executive officer  chief financial officer  and the next three most highly compensated executive officers but  in some instances  apply to a larger group of executives 
in addition  arra requires cpp participants to hold a non binding say on pay shareholder vote to approve the compensation of their executives 
participating institutions are also restricted from increasing their common stock dividend and from redeeming or repurchasing shares of their common stock while the treasury owns the institution s senior preferred stock 
see dividend restrictions above 
these dividend restrictions and executive and corporate governance standards must remain in place for so long as the treasury holds the cpp participant s senior preferred stock 
arra allows cpp participants  with the consent of the treasury and the federal reserve  to redeem at any time the senior preferred stock sold to the treasury 
upon the redemption of the senior preferred stock  the participant will no longer be required to comply with the dividend restrictions and executive compensation and corporate governance standards 
item a 
risk factors national penn s failure to comply with regulatory requirements may harm its business and financial results 
national penn is supervised by the federal reserve  and national penn bank is supervised by the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ 
as such  both national penn and national penn bank are subject to extensive regulation and may be the subject of supervisory enforcement action 
on january   national penn bank entered into a memorandum of understanding with the occ 
under this informal agreement  national penn bank agreed to develop and implement initiatives to enhance the oversight of problem assets  to enhance its process for the allowance for loan and lease losses  and to strengthen its internal loan review and credit administration functions 
implementing and completing these initiatives have required  and may continue to require  substantial oversight of our senior management team and directors and may constrain our operations 
additionally  national penn bank agreed to maintain  after march   a tier leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
at december   national penn bank s tier leverage ratio  tier risk based capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio were  and  respectively 
if national penn bank fails to comply with the memorandum of understanding or is unable to maintain its capital ratios at the agreed upon levels  or if national penn or national penn bank fail to meet any other regulatory requirements  national penn may be subject to further  formal supervisory enforcement actions  which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operation and business 
national penn may need to  or may be compelled to  raise additional capital in the future 
however  capital may not be available when needed and on terms favorable to current shareholders 
federal banking regulators require national penn and national penn bank to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their operations 
these capital levels are determined and dictated by law  regulation and banking regulatory agencies 
in addition  capital levels are also determined by national penn management and board of directors based on capital levels that they believe are necessary to support national penn business operations 
to be well capitalized under current bank regulatory guidelines  banking companies generally must maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
as noted above  national penn bank is required to maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
if national penn raises capital through the issuance of additional shares of its common stock or other securities  it would likely dilute the ownership interests of current investors and could dilute the per share book value and earnings per share of its common stock 
please refer to the risk factor below titled there may be future sales or other dilution of national penn equity  which may adversely affect the market price of national penn common stock 
furthermore  a capital raise through issuance of additional shares may have an adverse impact on national penn stock price 
new investors may also have rights  preferences and privileges senior to national penn current shareholders  which may adversely impact its current shareholders 
national penn ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital ma rkets at that time  which are outside of its control  and on its financial performance 
accordingly  national penn cannot be certain of its ability to raise additional capital on terms and time frames acceptable to it or to raise additional capital at all 
if national penn cannot raise additional capital in sufficient amounts when needed  its ability to comply with regulatory capital requirements could be materially impaired 
additionally  the inability to raise capital in sufficient amounts may adversely affect national penn operations  financial condition and results of operations 
deterioration in credit quality  particularly in commercial  construction and real estate loans  has adversely impacted national penn and may continue to adversely impact national penn 
in late  national penn began to experience a downturn in the overall credit performance of its loan portfolio  as well as acceleration in the deterioration of general economic conditions 
national penn believes that this deterioration  as well as a significant increase in national and regional unemployment levels and decreased sources of liquidity  have been the primary drivers of increased stress being placed on many borrowers and is negatively impacting borrowers ability to repay 
national penn s credit quality may remain challenging and at elevated levels of risk throughout further deterioration in the quality of national penn credit portfolio could significantly increase non performing loans  require additional increases in loan loss reserves  elevate charge off levels and have a material adverse effect on national penn capital  financial condition and results of operations 
national penn allowance for loan and lease losses may prove inadequate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposure 
national penn depends on the creditworthiness of its customers 
national penn periodically reviews the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses  considering economic conditions and trends  collateral values and credit quality indicators  including past charge off experience and levels of past due loans and non performing assets  classified assets and other regulatory requirements 
as a result of these considerations  national penn has from time to time increased its allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses may not be adequate over time to cover credit losses because of unanticipated adverse changes to the economy caused by recession  inflation  unemployment or other factors beyond national penn control 
if the credit quality of national penn customer base materially decreases  if the risk profil e of a market  industry or group of customers changes materially  or if the allowance for loan losses is not adequate  national penn business  financial condition  liquidity  capital and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
because its operations are concentrated in eastern pennsylvania  national penn performance and financial condition may be adversely affected by regional economic conditions and real estate values 
national penn loan activities are largely based in counties in eastern pennsylvania 
to a lesser extent  national penn deposit base is also generated from this area 
as a result  national penn consolidated financial performance depends largely upon economic conditions in this region 
weak local economic conditions during  and have caused national penn to experience an increase in loan delinquencies  an increase in the number of borrowers who defaulted on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans 
a continued downturn in the regional real estate market could further harm national penn financial condition and results of operations because of the geographic concentration of loans within this regional area and because a large percentage of its loans are secured by real property 
if there is a further decline in real estate values  the collateral for national penn loans will provide less security 
as a result  national penn ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate will be diminished  and national penn will be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans 
declines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely impact the value of national penn investments  financial performance and capital 
national penn maintains an investment portfolio that includes  but is not limited to  municipal bonds  bank equity securities  or individual trust preferred securities 
the market value of investments may be affected by factors other than the underlying performance of the issuer or composition of the bonds themselves  such as ratings downgrades  adverse changes in business climate and lack of liquidity for resales of certain investment securities 
national penn periodically  but not less than quarterly  evaluates investments and other assets for impairment indicators 
national penn may be required to record additional impairment charges if investments suffer a decline in value that is considered other than temporary 
if national penn determines that a significant impairment has occurred  national penn would be required to charge against earnings the credit related portion of the other than temporary impairment  which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the period in which the write off occurs 
national penn investment portfolio includes million in capital stock of the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh as of december  this stock ownership is required of all home loan bank members as part of the overall home loan bank capitalization 
the home loan bank is experiencing a potential capital shortfall  has suspended its quarterly cash dividend  and could possibly require its members  including national penn  to make additional capital investments in the home loan bank 
in order to avail itself of correspondent banking services offered by the home loan bank  national penn must remain a member of the home loan bank 
if the home loan bank were to cease operations  or if national penn were required to write off its investment in the home loan bank  national penn business  financial condition  liquidity  capital and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
national penn may incur impairments to goodwill 
at december   national penn had approximately million recorded as goodwill 
national penn tests its goodwill for impairment at least annually as of june th 
significant negative industry or economic trends  including the lack of recovery in the market price of national penn common stock  or reduced estimates of future cash flows or disruptions to national penn business could result in impairments to goodwill 
national penn valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely on projections of future operating performance 
national penn operates in competitive environments and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results 
if national penn analysis resul ts in additional impairment to its goodwill  national penn would be required to record an impairment charge to earnings in its financial statements during the period in which such impairment is determined to exist 
any such change could have a material adverse effect on national penn results of operations and stock price 
national penn s ability to realize its deferred tax asset may be reduced  which may adversely impact results of operations 
realization of a deferred tax asset requires national penn to exercise significant judgment and is inherently uncertain because it requires the prediction of future occurrences 
national penn s deferred tax asset may be reduced in the future if estimates of future income or our tax planning strategies do not support the amount of the deferred tax asset 
if it is determined that a valuation allowance of its deferred tax asset is necessary  national penn may incur a charge to earnings and a reduction to regulatory capital for the amount included therein 
negative conditions in the general economy and financial services industry may limit national penn access to additional funding and adversely impact liquidity 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on national penn liquidity 
national penn access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities could be impaired by factors that affect it specifically or the financial services industry in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact national penn access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of its business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against it 
national penn ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are nonspecific to national penn  such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative news and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole as evidenced by recent turmoil in the domesti c and worldwide credit markets 
national penn s business operations are subject to pervasive and comprehensive federal and state legislation  regulation and supervision which could adversely affect national penn 
business operations of national penn and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and state legislation  regulation  and supervision that govern almost all aspects of business operations 
this regulatory framework is primarily designed to protect consumers  depositors and the government s deposit insurance funds  and to accomplish other governmental policy objectives such as combating terrorism 
areas such as bank secrecy act bsa compliance including bsa and related anti money laundering regulations and real estate secured consumer lending such as truth in lending regulations  changes in real estate settlement procedures act regulations  implementation of licensing and registration requirements for mortgage originators and more recently  heightened regulatory attention to mortgage a nd foreclosure related activities and exposures are being confronted with escalating regulatory expectations and scrutiny 
in addition  national penn is subject to governmental oversight and regulation of its business as a participant in the us treasury s capital purchase program 
failure by national penn to comply with these requirements could result in adverse action by regulators  which would negatively affect national penn s reputation and could adversely affect national penn s ability to manage its business  and as a result  could be materially adverse to national penn s shareholders 
the impact of recent legislation  proposed legislation  and government programs intended to stabilize the financial markets cannot be predicted at this time  and such legislation is subject to change 
on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was signed into law 
under the eesa  the us treasury has the authority to  among other things  invest in financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
pursuant to this authority  the us treasury adopted its capital purchase program the cpp  under which it purchased preferred stock and warrants in eligible institutions  including national penn  to increase the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and to support the economy 
in accordance with the terms of the cpp  national penn issued to the us treasury shares of series b preferred stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of national penn common stock at per share the warrant  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the number of shares subject to the warrant was reduced to  after national penn completion in the third quarter of a qualifying equity offering of more than million 
participation in the cpp subjects national penn to increased oversight by the us treasury  regulators and congress 
on february   the eesa was amended by the american recovery and reinvestment act of the arra 
the eesa  the arra and the rules issued under these acts contain executive compensation restrictions and corporate governance standards that apply to all cpp participants  including national penn 
for example  participation in the cpp imposes restrictions on national penn ability to pay cash dividends on  and to repurchase  its common stock 
with regard to increased oversight  the us treasury has the power to unilaterally amend the terms of the cpp purchase agreement to the extent required to comply with changes in applicable federal law and to inspect national penn corporate books and records t hrough its federal banking regulator 
in addition  the us treasury has the right to appoint two persons to national penn board of directors if national penn misses dividend payments for six dividend periods  whether or not consecutive  on the preferred stock 
the eesa  the arra and the related rules subject national penn to restrictions on executive compensation that are complex  far reaching  and unprecedented  and that could materially affect national penn ability to attract  motivate  and or retain key executives and other key personnel 
congress has held hearings on implementation of the cpp and the use of funds and may adopt further legislation impacting financial institutions that have obtained funding under the cpp or changing lending practices that legislators believe should be changed 
although it is unclear what  if any  additional legislation will be enacted into law or rules will be issued  certain laws or rules may be enacted or imposed administratively by the us treasury that could further restrict national penn operations or increase governmental oversight of its businesses and its corporate governance practices 
the special inspector general for the troubled asset relief program  or tarp  has requested information from national penn and other tarp participants  including a description of past and anticipated uses of the tarp funds 
national penn and othe r cpp participants are also required to submit monthly reports about their lending and financial intermediation activities to the us treasury 
it is unclear at this point what the ramifications of such disclosure are or may be in the future 
the ultimate impact that the eesa  the arra and their implementing regulations  or any other legislation or governmental program  will have on the financial markets is unknown at this time 
the failure of the financial markets to stabilize and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect national penn business  results of operations  financial condition  access to funding and the trading price of national penn common stock 
new or changed governmental legislation or regulation and accounting industry pronouncements could adversely affect national penn 
in addition to the eesa and the arra  other changes in federal and state legislation and regulation may affect national penn s operations 
on july   the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act was signed into law 
the dodd frank act will implement significant changes to the us financial system  including among others new requirements on banking  derivative and investment activities  including the repeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on business demand accounts  debit card interchange fee requirements  and the volcker rule  which restricts the sponsorship  or the acquisition or retention of ownership interests  in private equity funds  the creation of a new bureau of consumer financial protection with supervisory authority  including the power to conduct examinations and take enforcement actions with respect to financial institutions with assets of billion or more  the creation of a financial stability oversight council with authority to identify institutions and practices that might pose a systemic risk  provisions affecting corporate governance and executive compensation of all companies subject to the reporting requirements of the securities and exchange act of  as amended  a provision that would broaden the base for fdic insurance assessments  and a provision that would require bank regulators to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as strong as those required for their insured depository subsidiaries  subject to a grandfather clause for holding companies with less than billion in assets as of december  in addition  under the dodd frank act and the eesa  national penn is required to submit its executive compensation program to an advisory non binding shareholder vote 
while a few of the dodd frank act s provisions became effective immediately  most are to be implemented by rules promulgated within six to eighteen months of signing 
in addition to the regulatory requirements of the dodd frank act  national penn is subject to changes in accounting rules and interpretations 
national penn cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in financial market regulation or accounting rules and interpretations will have on national penn 
national penn will have to devote a substantial amount of management and financial res ources to ensure compliance with such regulatory changes  including all applicable provisions of the dodd frank act and any implementing rules  which may increase national penn s costs of operations 
in addition  in some cases  national penn s ability to comply with regulatory changes may be dependent on third party vendors taking timely action to achieve compliance 
any such changes may also negatively affect national penn s financial performance  its ability to expand its products and services and or to increase the value of its business and  as a result  could be materially adverse to national penn s shareholders 
national penn may be required to pay significantly higher fdic premiums or special assessments that could adversely affect our earnings 
recent bank failures have severely depleted the fdic s insurance fund 
in response  the fdic adopted a final rule effective april   which differentiates for risk in calculating assessment rates 
the fdic levied a special assessment to all insured institutions payable june  to replenish the fund and at december   required insured institutions to pay insurance premiums in advance 
on april   the fdic voted to propose assessing higher fees on large  higher risk financial institutions and possibly lower fees for many small and less risky big banks 
the dodd frank act requires the fdic to increase reserves against future losses  which will require increased assessments that are to be borne primarily by institutions with assets of greater than billion 
although the precise impact on national penn will not be clear until implementing rules are adopted  any future increases in assessments or higher periodic fees could adversely affect national penn s earnings 
competition from other financial institutions may adversely affect national penn profitability 
national penn bank faces substantial competition in originating loans  both commercial and consumer 
this competition comes principally from other banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking companies and other lenders 
many of national penn competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources and higher lending limits  a wider geographic presence  the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives  as well as lower origination and operating costs 
additionally  several of national penn banking competitors are financial institutions that received multi million or multi billion dollar infusions of capital from the us treasury or other support from federal programs  which strengthened their balance sheets and enhanced their ability to withstand the uncertainty of the current economi c environment 
intensified competition from these institutions and or economic conditions could reduce national penn net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that national penn bank originates and the interest rates it may charge on these loans 
in attracting business and consumer deposits  national penn bank faces substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks  savings institutions and credit unions  as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives  including money market funds 
many of national penn competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources from participation in the cpp or otherwise  more aggressive marketing campaigns  better brand recognition and more branch locations 
these competitors may offer higher interest rates than national penn  which could decrease the deposits that national penn attracts or require national penn to increase its rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits 
increased deposit competition could adversely affect national penn ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations 
as a result  national penn may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase national penn cost of funds 
national penn bank and national penn non banking subsidiaries also compete with non bank providers of financial services  such as brokerage firms  consumer finance companies  credit unions  insurance agencies and governmental organizations which may offer more favorable terms 
some of national penn non bank competitors are subject to less extensive regulations than those governing national penn banking operations 
as a result  such non bank competitors may have advantages over national penn bank and non banking subsidiaries in providing financial products and services 
this competition may reduce or limit national penn margins on banking and non banking services reduce its market share and adversely affect its earnings and financial condition 
inability to hire or retain key personnel could adversely affect national penn s business 
national penn subsidiaries face intense competition with various other financial institutions for the attraction and retention of key personnel  specifically those who generate and maintain national penn customer relationships and serve in other key operation positions in the areas of finance  credit administration  loan functions and information technology 
these competitors may not be subject to the limitations on executive compensation imposed under the eesa and the arra  may not be subject to federal taxation  and may offer greater compensation and other benefits  which could result in the loss of potential and or existing key personnel  which may result in the loss of potential and or existing substantial customer relationships 
variations in interest rates may negatively affect national penn financial performance 
changes in interest rates may reduce profits 
the primary source of income for national penn currently is the differential  or the net interest spread  between the interest earned on loans  securities and other interest earning assets  and the interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
as prevailing interest rates change  net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and re pricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans  and rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations 
an increase in the general level of interest rates may also adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers to repay their obligations 
in a dec lining interest rate environment  national penn may be unable to re price deposits downward in the same magnitude and or with the same timing as the movement in its interest sensitive assets 
accordingly  changes in levels of market interest rates  whether upward or downward  could materially adversely affect national penn net interest spread  loan origination volume  asset quality and overall profitability 
if national penn information systems are interrupted or sustain a breach in security  those events may negatively affect national penn financial performance and reputation 
in conducting its business  national penn relies heavily on its information systems 
maintaining and protecting those systems is difficult and expensive  as is dealing with any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems  whether due to acts or omissions by national penn or by a third party and whether intentional or not 
any such failure  interruption or breach could result in failures or disruptions in national penn customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
the policies  procedures and technical safeguards put in place by national penn to prevent or limit the effect of any failure  interruption or security breach of its information systems may be insufficient to prevent or remedy the effects of any such occurrences 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security bre aches of national penn information systems could damage national penn reputation  result in a loss of customer business and data  subject national penn to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose national penn to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on national penn financial condition and results of operations 
if national penn information technology is unable to keep pace with its growth or industry developments  national penn financial performance may suffer 
effective and competitive delivery of national penn products and services is increasingly dependent upon information technology resources and processes  both those provided internally as well as those provided through third party vendors 
in addition to better serving customers  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables national penn to reduce costs 
national penn future success will depend  in part  upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services to enhance customer convenience  as well as to create additional efficiencies in its operations 
many of national penn competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
additionally  as technology in the financial services industry changes and evolves  keeping pace becomes increasi ngly complex and expensive for national penn 
there can be no assurance that national penn will be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services  which could reduce its ability to compete effectively 
national penn internal control systems are inherently limited 
national penn systems of internal controls  disclosure controls and corporate governance policies and procedures are inherently limited 
the inherent limitations of national penn system of internal controls include the use of judgment in decision making that can be faulty  breakdowns can occur because of human error or mistakes  and controls can be circumvented by individual acts or by collusion of two or more people 
the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and any design may not succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
because of the inherent limitation of a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected  which may have an adverse effect on national penn business  results of operations or financial condition 
additionally  any plans of remediation for any identified limitations may be ineffective in improving national penn internal controls 
there may be future sales or other dilution of national penn shareholders  which may adversely affect the market price of national penn common stock 
national penn is not restricted from issuing additional common shares  including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for  or that represent the right to receive  common shares 
national penn is currently authorized to issue up to million common shares  of which million shares were outstanding as of december   and up to one million shares of preferred stock  none of which are outstanding other than  shares of series b preferred stock  which national penn issued to the us treasury in connection with participation in the cpp 
in addition  national penn s board of directors has made shares available for compensation purposes  including under its employee stock purchase plan  as well as for compensation including shares available for purchase under national penn dividend reinvestment and s tock purchase plan 
the employee stock purchase plan allows employee shareholders to purchase shares of national penn common shares at a discount from market value 
in addition  shares are issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock units and or exercise of stock options that have been  or stock options  stock appreciation rights  stock awards and restricted stock that may be  issued under national penn equity compensation plans 
the us treasury may  at its option  exercise its warrant to purchase  of national penn common shares the number of shares remaining subject to the warrant after national penn s completion in the third quarter of a qualifying equity offering of more than million 
should the us treasury exercise its warrant or should national penn experience strong participation in the employee stock purchase plan or the dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan  the issuance of the required shares of common stock will dilute the ownership of na tional penn shareholders 
national penn also has the ability to issue an unlimited amount of securities including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares and securities warrants  from time to time at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of sale under an active shelf registration statement  which it filed with the sec on november  national penn board of directors has authority  without action or vote of the shareholders  to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares 
these authorized but unissued shares could be issued on terms or in circumstances that could dilute the interests of other shareholders 
in addition  national penn may decide to repurchase the series b preferred stock issued to the us treasury in connection with national penn participation in the cpp 
to repurchase the preferred stock  national penn is required to obtain the approval of national penn primary federal regulator which may require national penn to raise additional capital prior to repurchasing the series b preferred stock 
should national penn choose to raise capital by selling shares of common stock for any reason  including  without limitation  for the purpose of repurchasing its series b preferred stock or for increasing its regulatory capital  the issuance would have a dilutive effect on national penn other shareholders and could have a material negative effect on the market price of national penn common stock 
national penn relies on dividends it receives from its subsidiaries  may further reduce or eliminate cash dividends on its common stock  and is subject to restrictions on its ability to declare or pay cash dividends and repurchase shares of common stock 
as a bank holding company  national penn ability to pay dividends depends primarily on its receipt of dividends from its direct and indirect subsidiaries 
its bank subsidiary  national penn bank  is national penn primary source of dividends 
dividend payments from national penn bank are subject to legal and regulatory limitations  generally based on net profits and retained earnings  imposed by bank regulatory agencies 
the ability of national penn bank to pay dividends is also subject to profitability  financial condition  regulatory capital requirements  capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements

there can be no assurance that national penn will pay dividends to its shareholders in the future  or if dividends are paid  that national penn will increase its dividend to historical levels or otherwise 
national penn ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is not only subject to limitations imposed by the terms of the cpp  but also by limitations and guidance issued by the board of governors of the federal reserve system  or the federal reserve 
for example  under federal reserve guidance  bank holding companies gene rally are advised to consult in advance with the federal reserve before declaring dividends  and to strongly consider reducing  deferring or eliminating dividends  in certain situations  such as when declaring or paying a dividend that would exceed earnings for the fiscal quarter for which the dividend is being paid  or when declaring or paying a dividend that could result in a material adverse change to the organization capital structure 
importantly  federal reserve limitations and guidance are relevant not only to dividends paid on national penn common stock  but also to those payable in respect of national penn preferred stock held by the us treasury 
national penn failure to pay dividends on its preferred stock or common stock could have a material adverse effect on its business  operations  financial condition  access to funding and the market price of its common stock 
under the terms of national penn purchase agreement with the us treasury pursuant to which national penn issued the series b preferred stock and the warrant  national penn ability to declare or pay dividends on any of its stock is restricted 
specifically  national penn may not declare dividend payments on common  junior preferred or pari passu preferred stock if it is in arrears on the dividends on the series b preferred stock 
further  national penn may not pay quarterly cash dividends on its common stock above per share  without the us treasury approval until december   unless all of the series b preferred stock has been redeemed or transferred 
national penn ability to repurchase its common stock is also restricted under the terms of the purchase agreement with the us treasury 
the us treasury consent generally is required for national penn to make any stock repurchases until december   unless all of the series b preferred stock has been redeemed or transferred 
further  common  junior preferred or pari passu preferred shares may not be repurchased if national penn is in arrears on the series b preferred stock dividends 
there can be no assurance that national penn will repurchase the series b preferred stock and the warrant or that national penn regulators would approve such redemption and repurchase 
to repurchase the series b preferred stock and the warrant  national penn must obtain regulatory approval 
there can be no assurance when or if the series b preferred stock or the warrant can be repurchased or what the redemption price for the warrant will be 
until such time as the series b preferred stock and the warrant are repurchased  national penn will remain subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement with the us treasury  the series b preferred stock and the warrant  which  among other things impose restrictions on quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and  with some exceptions  on repurchases of its common stock 
further  national penn continued participation in the cpp subjects it to increased regulatory and legislative oversight

national penn may be a defendant from time to time in a variety of litigation and other actions  which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
national penn and its subsidiaries may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation arising out of its business

should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation exceed national penn insurance coverage  they could have a material adverse effect on national penn s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  national penn may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future  nor may national penn be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms  if at all

risk factors  which is incorporated by reference into this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and predominant practices within the banking industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the discussion below outlines the company s critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan and lease losses the methodology for determining the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance is considered by management to be a critical accounting policy due to the high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the assumptions utilized and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the allowance for loan losses considered 
the company continually reassesses the allowance and charges off uncollectible loans against the allowance when circumstances do not warrant continuance of the loan as a viable asset 
recoveries of assets previously written off  if any  are credited to the allowance when they are received 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb probable loan and lease losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on quarterly evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others  expected defaults  estimated loss in event of default  and the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows or collateral liquidation values on impaired loans 
the process also considers historical loss experience  economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of acquired net assets in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing at least annually  which the company performs as of june th each year 
on an interim basis  the company evaluates whether circumstances are present that would indicate potential impairment of its goodwill 
these circumstances include prolonged trading value of the company s common stock relative to its book value  adverse changes in the business or legal climate  actions by regulators  or loss of key personnel 
when the company determines that these or other circumstances are present  the company tests the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at an interim date 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test in which the company identifies its reporting units and compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying amount  inclusive of the goodwill assigned it 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value  an indicator of goodwill impairment exists and a second step test is performed to determine if any goodwill impairment exists 
in the second step  the company calculates the implied value of goodwill by emulating a business combination for each reporting unit 
this step subtracts the estimated fair value of net assets in the reporting unit from the step one estimated fair value to determine the implied value of goodwill 
if the implied value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill all ocated to the reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired  but if the implied value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit  a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the difference in the consolidated statement of operations with a corresponding reduction to goodwill on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company s business segments are its reporting units which are community banking and other for purposes of the goodwill impairment test 
in performing its evaluation of goodwill impairment  the company makes significant judgments  particularly with respect to estimating the fair value of each reporting unit and if the second step test is required  estimating the fair value of net assets 
the company utilizes a third party specialist who assists with valuation techniques to evaluate each reporting unit and estimate a fair value as though it were an acquirer 
the estimates utilize historical data  cash flows  and market and industry data specific to each reporting unit 
industry and market data is used to develop material assumptions such as transaction multiples  required rates of return  control premiums  transaction costs and synergies of a transaction  and capitalization 
other intangible assets are specifically identified intangible assets created from a business combination 
core deposit intangibles represent the value of checking  savings and other acquired  low cost deposits 
core deposit intangibles are amortized over the lesser of the estimated lives of deposit accounts or ten years on an accelerated basis 
decreases in deposit lives may result in increased amortization and or an impairment charge 
other intangible assets also include customer lists and covenants not to compete 
these assets are amortized over the lesser of their contractual life or estimated economic life on a straight line basis 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet for future tax consequences that arise from the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
changes in tax rates are recognized in the company s financial statements during the period they are enacted 
when a deferred tax asset or liability  or a change thereto  is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet  deferred tax expense or benefit is recorded within the income tax expense line of the consolidated statement of operations for purposes of determining the current period s net income 
the principal types of differences between assets and liabilities for financial statement and tax return purposes are net operating losses  allowance for loan and lease losses  deferred loan fees  deferred compensation and unrealized gains or losses on investment securities available for sale 
deferred tax assets are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at net realizable value 
the company performs an assessment each reporting period to evaluate the amount of deferred tax asset it is more likely than not to realize 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount of taxable income expected in future periods  as tax benefits require taxable income to be realized 
if a valuation allowance is required  the deferred tax asset on the consolidated balance sheet is reduced via a corresponding income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company recognizes the benefit of a tax position in the financial statements only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
for these analyses  the company may engage attorneys to provide opinions related to certain positions 
other than temporary impairment when the fair value of an investment security is less than the carrying value  the security is considered to be impaired  and as such the company reviews the security for the presence of other than temporary impairment otti 
this analysis is performed at least quarterly  and includes consideration of numerous factors including  but not limited to  the time period for which the fair value has been less than the carrying value  curtailment or suspension of dividends or cash flows  deterioration of financial performance or the creditworthiness of the issuer  the performance of any underlying collateral  and negative trends in a particular industry or sector 
the conclusion as to whether otti exists for an investment security is ultimately based upon the company  s evaluation of the recoverability above its carrying value and its timing 
in addition  the company considers whether it plans to sell an investment security and whether it may be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its carrying value 
when the company concludes an investment security is other than temporarily impaired  a loss for the difference between the investment security s carrying value and the fair value is recognized as a reduction to non interest income in the consolidated statement of operations 
for an investment in a debt security  if the company does not intend to sell the investment security and concludes that it is not more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovering the carrying value  which may be maturity  the otti charge is separated into the credit and other components 
the other component of the otti is included in other comprehensive income  net of the tax effect  and the credit component of the otti is incl uded as a reduction to non interest income in the consolidated statement of operations

as such  understanding and evaluating economic conditions is a vital part of the company s risk management 
per federal reserve data  business activity is mixed across sectors 
retailers  auto dealers  and manufacturers reported modest increases in sales  but the service sector has experienced mixed results with healthcare and technology demonstrating growth offset by real estate and construction related activity which demonstrated weakness 
vacancy rates and rents have been nearly steady and lower rents have led to increased leasing activities 
the outlook among third district business contacts is for slow improvement 
most agreed that stronger growth will not occur until economic conditions  particularly employme nt  show significant signs of improvement 
employment data suggests that the stress in local labor markets has subsided somewhat with a slight year over year improvement 
however  employee additions in anticipation of increased activity remain limited 
demographic and employment trends resulting from the economic downturn continue to impact demand for housing in the region  which has resulted in weakness in real estate and collateral values

the annual goodwill impairment test  excluding christiana  was performed as of june   and it was concluded that there was no additional goodwill impairment 
with respect to christiana  the company determined that the announced sale  during the second quarter of  represented an indicator of impairment  since christiana was determined to be a separate business and  inclusive of its goodwill  the carrying value was in excess of the sale price 
evaluation of goodwill impairment requires substantial judgment 
the test includes estimating the fair value of each reporting unit and if the second step test is required  estimating the fair value of net assets 
third party specialists are utilized to assist in developing assumptions during the testing process 
the goodwill impairment test incorporates discounted cash flow analysis and the use of two separate market based approaches 
the step one and step two tests incorporated assumptions related to merger and acquisition values  control premiums  synergies available to a potential acquirer net of transaction expenses  views on regulatory matters  and expectations for returns given the perceived level of risk in the financial services and banking industry 
the assumptions utilized were consistent with the interim impairment test performed as of december   which reflected the continued deterioration of the industry and market data 
in addition  the analysis utilizes projected financial performance  which has been negatively impacted by credit quality as a result of economic deterioration 
the company s projections assume that the current economic climate improves gradually over several quarters 
in addition  existing legislative and regulatory require ments were assumed to continue for the duration of the analysis 
the company s business segments are its reporting units  which are community banking and other  for purposes of the goodwill impairment test 
prior to the impairment test  the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the community banking reporting unit was million and the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the other reporting unit was million  exclusive of christiana 
upon testing  the other reporting unit passed the step one test with its fair value substantially in excess of its carrying value  inclusive of goodwill assigned to it 
as a result  no further analysis was performed for the other reporting unit 
the step two goodwill impairment test for the community banking reporting unit was intended to be a measure of the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  resulting from failure of the step one test 
in the performance of the step two test  management measured the implied fair value of goodwill in the community banking reporting unit as if an acquirer of the community banking reporting unit in a business combination 
this was achieved by estimating and assigning fair values to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the fair value of net assets fair value of all assets other than goodwill  minus the fair value of liabilities was subtracted from the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to determine the implied value of goodwill 
the difference betw een the community banking reporting units implied value of goodwill from the step two tests exceeded the carrying value of goodwill  and therefore goodwill was determined to not be impaired 
the unrecorded adjustments to material assets and liabilities not already measured at fair value on the company s balance sheet for purposes of the step two test for the community banking reporting unit included core deposit intangibles loans certificates of deposit borrowings fhlb advances and repurchase agreements in periods subsequent to the annual impairment test  management evaluated whether indicators were present which would require an interim goodwill impairment test and determined there to be none 
the conclusions of the goodwill impairment evaluation are subject to assumptions or changes thereto  and any additional  adverse economic developments that cause further deterioration in the industry or adversely affect the company s financial performance could negatively affect the assumptions underlying our analysis and the estimates management made 
such developments could require the performance of additional tests which could result in impairment

non interest expense for the year ended december  compared to exclusive of million and million of goodwill impairment in and  respectively  non interest expense totaled million for the year ended december  and continued efforts to control expenses caused a million reduction to salaries  wages  and employee benefits which totaled million for the year ended december  also  net premises and equipment expense decreased million to million compared to million for other operating expenses decreased slightly compared to and totaled million for this reduction offset the million increase to fdic insurance expense which totaled million for the expense reductions reflect the company s efforts to control expenses and mitigate the negative impact of regulatory compliance costs and workout expe nses 
also  included a million benefit from insurance proceeds which reduced non interest expense 
non interest expense for the year ended december  compared to non interest expense was million for the twelve months ended december   a million increase as compared with million for the same period in the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to million of goodwill impairment expense recorded in and a million increase in fdic insurance expense due to the special assessment and other increases in assessment rates 
other operating expenses increased million from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to million of loan collection expense  million of shares tax  million of fhlb prepayment penalties  and million of additional marketing expenses 
these increases were offset by a million fraud recovery received in  compared to million of fraud loss in income tax expense income tax expense totaled million for the year ended december  income tax expense during was comprised primarily of expenses resulting from the redemption of the company s separate account boli policies  which totaled million  and expense on the tax gain resulting from the sale of christiana  which totaled million 
the company was able to utilize its net operating loss nol carry forward to alleviate the taxes otherwise payable in cash to the irs 
the tax expense inclusive of the boli redemption and sale of christiana resulted in an effective tax rate of during income taxes were a benefit of million with an effective tax rate of for income tax benefit was million in with an effective tax rate of 
the company s effective tax rate was less than the statutory rate in and due primarily to the tax advantaged investment and life insurance income 
as of december   after careful analysis  management determined that the net deferred tax asset was realizable  and therefore a valuation allowance was not required 
in reaching this conclusion positive and negative evidence were both carefully considered 
negative evidence considered included the pre tax net loss in and the effect it had in evaluating cumulative losses for a period of time including through december  management considered the drivers of the loss and their nature 
specifically  management considered the goodwill impairment charge and the losses recorded on the cdo s to be aberrations 
the goodwill impairment charge of million was identified  since it was non tax deductible  and the losses from the credit deterioration and subsequent exit of the cdos investments in and w ere also considered to be non recurring 
the cdos had a higher risk profile than the company s historical and existing investment strategy  and the credit risk was significantly different than the high credit quality of the remaining investment portfolio 
positive evidence considered included operating profits and the ability to utilize a significant portion of the nol carry forward during the year 
in addition  the ability to carry back a portion of the losses to prior years  strong earnings history  and a projected ability to fully utilize the net deferred tax asset with substantial excess  prior to the implementation of any tax planning strategies  all were considered 
projections incorporated current financial results  including the impact of regulatory and credit costs in the current economic environment 
in future periods  the current economic climate was assumed to improve gradually  but existing legislative and regulatory requirements were assumed to continue 
the assumptions used in analyzing the realizability of the net deferred tax asset are consistent with other analyses and judgments made in the preparation of these financial statements 
however  if there are substantial  adverse economic developments that further deteriorate credit quality or profitability  the judgments made regarding the company s ability to utilize the deferred tax asset may change 
this would result in additional income tax expense being recorded in the statement of operations 
these types of events or a valuation allowance would impact regulatory capital by the amount currently included in tier capital

liquidity and interest rate sensitivity the primary function of asset liability management is to ensure adequate liquidity and to support the efficient management of risk and performance in managing the company s financial assets and liabilities 
the company s board of directors establishes general liquidity guidelines for management to meet  which can be summarized as the ability to generate and maintain adequate amounts of cash to meet the demand from depositors who wish to withdraw funds  borrowers who require funds  and capital expansion 
liquidity consists of cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities 
the company also employs a diverse capital raising strategy which may include issuance of additional equity capital 
the company s largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the deposit base that comes from retail  corporate and institutional banking deposit customers 
the company also utilizes wholesale funding that comes from a diverse mix of short and long term funding sources 
wholesale funding is defined here as funding sources outside of the core deposit base  such as correspondent bank borrowings  secured borrowing lines from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh fhlb  the federal reserve bank of philadelphia frb and brokered cds 
the company s principal source of day to day liquidity is its liquid cash reserve on hand generated from core deposit operations 
should demand exceed this reserve and normal deposit authority efforts  funds are obtained through wholesale ch annels  details of which are set out in within liabilities in item and footnote in item of this report 
the company did not incrementally draw on these lines in as it was unnecessary 
the liquidity and credit crises faced by many financial and commercial institutions in recent years have not negatively affected the company s liquidity 
funds continue to be available at reasonable rates  and dependence on borrowings has been reduced throughout despite actual funding needs  management continues to actively monitor and manage liquidity and current available funding channels to ensure an appropriate contingency funding strategy plan is in place 
the company s levels of liquidity at december   included million of the million of interest earning deposits with banks represents unencumbered on hand liquidity 
fhlb borrowing limit of billion  of which million was drawn at december   leaving an unused capacity of billion 
million in overnight borrowing capacity from correspondent banks 
as of and for the year ended december   the company had no need to access these lines and the full amount was available for use 
as measured using the consolidated statement of cash flow  for the year ended december   the company generated million in net cash and equivalents compared to million in and million in net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in  and million in investing activities generated million of cash during  compared to million used in and million used in cash in was generated principally from repayments of proceeds from investments of million and net loan repayments of million 
during  cash was deployed to purchase investment securities totaling million 
the primary difference in cash provided from investing activities compared to the prior year was an increase in net loan repayment of million 
in  million of cash was used for net loan originations and correspondingly investment purchases were million 
cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million and million generated from financing activities in and  respectively 
disciplined deposit pricing efforts in led to reductions in deposits totaling million  compared to million and million of increased deposits in and  respectively  of this decline  million was attributable to managed reduction of higher cost jumbo cds 
also in  million of cash was provided from the issuance of shares of national penn common stock  net of issuance costs compared to million in and million in however  in  million of cash was provided by the company s issuance of preferred stock to the us treasury as part of the cpp program 
the cash provided from the issuance of common share s in was primarily from the october th investment by warburg pincus llc 
warburg pincus agreed to invest million via a direct purchase of newly issued common stock at per share  of which the initial million receipt was completed in october  and the remaining million was received in january the company s largest business segment is its community banking segment  whose business activities principally includes accepting deposits and making loans 
as a result  the company s largest source of revenue is net interest income  which subjects it to movements in market interest rates 
management s objective for interest rate risk management is to understand the company s susceptibility to changes in interest rates and develop and implement strategies to minimize volatility while maximizing net interest income 
the board of directors establishes policies that govern interest rate risk management 
this is accomplished via a centralized asset liability management committee alco 
alco is comprised of various members of the company s busi ness lines who are responsible for managing the components of interest rate risk timing differences between contractual maturities and or repricing of assets and liabilities repricing gap  risk that assets will repay or customers withdraw prior to contractual maturity prepayments  changes in the slopes and the shape of the yield curve yield curve risk  and timing of changes in interest rates the time period it takes for one interest rate index to change compared to another  given changes in market conditions basis risk 
alco employs various techniques and instruments to implement its developed strategies 
these generally include one or more of the following changes to interest rates offered on products  changes to maturity terms offered on products  changes to types of products offered  and or use of wholesale products such as advances from the fhlb or interest rate swaps 
the company uses a simulation model to identify and manage its interest rate risk profile 
the model measures projected net interest income at risk and anticipated changes in net income and economic value of equity 
the model is based on expected cash flows and repricing characteristics for all financial instruments at a point in time and incorporates company developed  market based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on these financial instruments 
the company also incorporates assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income 
while actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies  this model has proven to be an important guidance tool for alco 
the following table demonstrates the timing of repriced assets and scheduled maturities for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  repricing periods three months one year within through through over dollars in thousands three months one year five years years interest earning assets interest bearing deposits at banks investment securities and other securities loans and leases total interest earning assets  cumulative total interest earning assets  liabilities and equity non maturity deposits time deposits borrowed funds subordinated debt total interest bearing liabilities  cumulative total interest bearing liabilities interest earning assets less interest bearing liabilities cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due 
fixed rate loans are included in the period in which they are scheduled to be repaid and are adjusted to take into account estimated prepayments based upon assumptions estimating the expected prepayments in the prevailing interest rate environment 
the table assumes prepayments and scheduled principal amortization of fixed rate loans and mortgage backed securities  and assumes that adjustable rate mortgages will reprice at contractual repricing intervals 
there has been no adjustment for the impact of future commitments and loans in process 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the company s assets and liabilities 
these characteristics in terms of volumes are stratified into time buckets identifying pricing gaps  thus repricing risk 
minimizing maturity and repricing risk is a continual focus in a changing rate environment 
the company s gap position  as reflected in the above table  indicates a liability sensitive position in the short term 
however  the company is net asset sensitive overall 
an interest rate gap table does not present a complete picture of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
first  changes in the general level of interest rates do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
 second  assets and liabilities which can contractually reprice within the same period may not  in fact  reprice at the same time or to the same extent 
third  the table represents a one day position  variations occur daily as the company adjusts its interest sensitivity throughout the year 
fourth  assumptions must be made to construct such a table 
finally  the repricing distribution of interest sensitive assets may not be indicative of the liquidity of those assets 
gap analysis is a useful measurement of asset and liability management  however  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on this measure 
therefore  the company supplements gap analysis with the calculation changes in net interest income from various shocked interest rate environments 
the following table demonstrates the expected effect that a parallel interest rate shift would have on the company s net interest income dollars in thousands change in december  december  interest rates change in net interest income change in net interest income in basis points as measured by the net interest income analysis  the company should benefit in the short run by an increase in interest rates 
this reflects a similar profile as in the prior year 
the results of the net interest income analysis fall within the compliance guidelines established by alco 
the company uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity 
alco approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging 
the derivatives employed by the company currently include forward sales of mortgage commitments  hedging of interest rate derivatives provided to customers  and cash flow hedges 
the company does not use any of these instruments for trading purposes 
for details of derivatives  refer to footnote included in item of this report 
contractual obligations and other commitments the following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of december  after one after three less than year to years to more than dollars in thousands total one year three years five years five years remaining contractual maturities of time deposits loan commitments federal home loan bank advances subordinated debentures letters of credit dividends preferred stock minimum annual rentals or non cancelable operating leases total term is unlimited assumed year term for this table
