index recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  an amendment of asc topic  revenue recognition 
asu no 
provides amendments to the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
as a result of these amendments  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements will be separated in more circumstances than under existing us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the asu does this by establishing a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
a vendor will be required to determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis 
this asu also eliminates the residual method of allocation and will require that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method  which allocates any discount in the overall arrangement proportionally to each deliverable based on its relative selling price 
expanded disclosures of qualitative and quantitative information regarding application of the multiple deliverable revenue arrangement guidance are also required under the asu 
the asu does not apply to arrangements for which industry specific allocation and measurement guidance exists  such as long term construction contracts and software transactions 
asu no 
is effective for the company in the fiscal year beginning february  the company is currently evaluating the impact asu no 
will have on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this update provides amendments to subtopic that require new disclosures on the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and reasons for the transfers and in the reconciliation for level fair value measurements  the separate presentation of information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements 
the new disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of this update to asc topic did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues from product sales or services provided when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
fasb asc topic  revenue recognition  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with fasb asc topic depreciation and amortization property  plant and equipment  finite lived intangible assets and certain other long lived assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
property  plant and equipment  as well as intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 

index goodwill in accordance with fasb asc topic  goodwill  the company s unamortized goodwill balance is being assessed  at least annually  for impairment 
the company performs its annual impairment test for each reporting unit using a fair value approach 
the test for goodwill impairment involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units  which comprise our operating segments 
in calculating the fair value of the reporting units using the present value of estimated future cash flows method  we rely on a number of assumptions including sales and related gross margin projections  operating margins  anticipated working capital requirements and market rate of returns used in discounting projected cash flows 
these assumptions were based upon market and industries outlooks  our business plans and historical data 
inherent uncertainties exist in determining and applying such factors 
the discount rate used in the projection of fair value represents a weighted average cost of capital applicable to the company 
during the fiscal year ended january   we performed an impairment analysis on each of the company s reporting units that carry goodwill on their balance sheets 
in each case  the fair value exceeded the carrying amount  including goodwill  by a significant amount  except for flex kleen which represents of the total company wide goodwill 
for flex kleen  the carrying value as of january  and amounted to million and million  respectively 
the fair value of flex kleen as of january  and totaled million and million  respectively 
as a result  the fair value exceeded the carrying amount  including goodwill  by million and million at january  and  respectively 
therefore  as of january   flex kleen s goodwill was not impaired 
flex kleen  which initially performed well after being acquired in  thereafter had several years of declining performance which we attributed primarily to a general weakness in its served markets  followed by improved performance in the fiscal years ended january   and in the fiscal years ended january   and  actual results exceeded the projected results used in our impairment model 
during the fiscal year ended january   flex kleen s net sales and operating profit were below the projections in our impairment model  which we believe was a reflection of the downturn in global business and economic conditions during this period of time and was not due to any new development specific to flex kleen 
in the fiscal year ended january   flex kleen s net sales were below the projections but operating profit was slightly above the projections in our impairment model 
our impairment model requires that flex kleen s sales and operating profit improve during each of the next several fiscal years in order for us to avoid a potential impairment charge 
because of market conditions and or potential changes in strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
based on current projections  a one percent decrease in revenue growth  a one percent decrease in gross margin or a one percent increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value for flex kleen by million  million  and million  respectively 
additionally  the company cannot predict the occurrence of unknown events that might adversely affect the reportable value of its goodwill 
pension obligations the determination of our obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and our future expense 

index forward looking statements  factors that may affect future results our prospects are subject to certain uncertainties and risk 
this annual report on form k also contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these forward looking statements may be identified by words describing our belief or expectation  such as where we say that we believe  expect or anticipate  or where we characterize something in a manner in which there is an express or implicit reference to the future  such as non recurring or unusual  or where we express that our view is based upon the current status of a given matter  or upon facts as we know them as of the date of the statement 
the content and or context of other statements that we make may indicate that the statement is forward looking 
we claim the safe harbor provided by the private securities reform act of for all forward looking statements 
results may differ materially from our current results and actual results could differ materially from those suggested in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors  including but not limited to those set forth below  other one time events  other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in met pro s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the following important factors  along with those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  could affect our future financial condition and results of operations  and could cause our future financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from those expressed in our sec filings and in our forward looking statements the write down of goodwill  as a result of the determination that the acquired business is impaired 
flex kleen  which initially performed well after being acquired by met pro  thereafter had several years of declining performance which we attributed primarily to a general weakness in its served markets  followed by improved performance in the fiscal years ended january   and during the fiscal year ended january   flex kleen s net sales and operating profit were below the projections in our impairment model  which we believe was a reflection of the downturn in global business and economic conditions during this period of time and was not due to any new development specific to flex kleen 
in the fiscal year ended january   flex kleen s net sales were below that which is required by our impairment model  while the fiscal year operating profit was slightly higher than the amount which is required by our impairment model 
during the fiscal year ended january   we performed an impairment analysis of the million of goodwill that the company carries for flex kleen and concluded that no impairment had occurred 
our impairment model requires that flex kleen s sales and operating profit improve during each of the next several fiscal years in order for us to avoid a potential impairment charge 
while we project that flex kleen s performance during the fiscal year ending january  will be sufficient to avoid an impairment charge  our projections are forward looking statements where the actual results may not be as we presently anticipate  materially adverse changes in economic conditions i in the markets served by us or ii in significant customers of ours  material changes in available technology  adverse developments in the asbestos cases that have been filed against the company  including without limitation the exhaustion of insurance coverage  the imposition of punitive damages or other adverse developments in the availability of insurance coverage 
during the fiscal year ended january   a rehabilitation order was entered against one of our insurers  based upon its alleged insolvency 
it appears that our remaining insurers have assumed prospectively the share of the defense and indemnity obligations that this one insurer had agreed to assume  and despite the alleged insolvency of this one insurer  we continue to believe that our insurance coverage is adequate for the cases currently pending against us and  assuming the continuation of the current profile and volume of cases  for the cases that may be filed against us in the foreseeable future  changes in accounting rules promulgated by regulatory agencies  including the sec  which could result in an impact on earnings  the cost of compliance with sarbanes oxley and other applicable legal and listing requirements  and the unanticipated possibility that met pro may not meet these requirements  weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  which either alone or combined with actions by our employees intended to circumvent our internal control over financial reporting  to violate our policies  or to commit fraud or other bad acts  could lead to incorrect reporting of financial results 
we believe that our internal control over financial reporting as of january  is effective  however  there are limits to any control system and we cannot give absolute assurance that our internal control is effective or that financial statement misstatements will not occur or that policy violations and or fraud within the company will not occur  unexpected results in our product development activities  loss of key customers  changes in product mix and the cost of materials  with effect on margins

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
for met pro corporation  these exposures are primarily related to changes in interest rates 
we do not currently hold any derivatives or other financial instruments purely for trading or speculative purposes 
the carrying value of the company s total long term debt and current maturities of long term debt  at january  was million 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease increase in future earnings and cash flows resulting from a hypothetical increase decrease in the company s estimated weighted average borrowing rate at january  although most of the interest on the company s debt is indexed to either the libor or euribor market rates  there would be no material effect on the future earnings or cash flows related to the company s total debt for such a hypothetical change 
the company has only a limited involvement with derivative financial instruments 
the company has one interest rate swap agreement to hedge against the potential impact on earnings from increases in market interest rates 
effective april   the company entered into a fifteen year interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount equal to the balance on the bond payable maturing april the company swapped the ninety day libor for a fixed rate of 
as of january  the effective fixed interest rate was as a result of the swap agreement plus the interest rate floor provision of basis points 
the interest rate swap agreement is accounted for as a fair value hedge that qualifies for treatment under the short cut method of measuring effectiveness in accordance with fasb asc topic  derivatives and hedging 
there was no hedge ineffectiveness as of january  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement resulted in a decrease in equity of  net of tax and  net of tax at january  and  respectively 
these results are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive loss section of shareholders equity 
see note  debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company has wholly owned subsidiaries located in the netherlands  canada and the people s republic of china 
in the past  we have not hedged our foreign currency exposure  and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results 
future changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively impact our revenues  operating expenses and earnings 
due to the fact that most of our foreign sales are denominated in the local currency  we do not anticipate that exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations will be material in the fiscal year ending january
