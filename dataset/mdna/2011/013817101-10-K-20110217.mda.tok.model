overview our business alcoa is the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum  fabricated aluminum  and alumina combined  through its active and growing participation in all major aspects of the industry technology  mining  refining  smelting  fabricating  and recycling 
aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the london metal exchange lme and priced daily based on market supply and demand 
aluminum and alumina represent more than of alcoa s revenues  and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of alcoa 
nonaluminum products include precision castings and aerospace and industrial fasteners 
alcoa s products are used worldwide in aircraft  automobiles  commercial transportation  packaging  building and construction  oil and gas  defense  and industrial applications 

table of contents alcoa is a global company operating in countries 
based upon the country where the point of sale occurred  the us and europe generated and  respectively  of alcoa s sales in in addition  alcoa has investments and operating activities in australia  brazil  china  guinea  iceland  russia  and saudi arabia  all of which present opportunities for substantial growth 
governmental policies  laws and regulations  and other economic factors  including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  affect the results of operations in these countries 
management review of and outlook for the future in  management was faced with the challenge of preserving alcoa s future while navigating the company through a global economic downturn that coupled an unprecedented decline in lme pricing levels began in the second half of with a collapse in demand from aluminum product end markets 
management adopted a holistic response to this situation by initiating various actions  including curtailing additional refinery and smelter capacity necessitating further layoffs  reducing the quarterly common stock dividend  issuing new equity and debt instruments  optimizing alcoa s business and investment portfolio  and instituting a two year program to achieve targets related to procurement efficiencies  overhead rationalization  and working capital improvements 
all of these actions were aimed at reducing costs  improving cash levels  and preserving liquidity 
upon achieving the established performance targets in year one of this program  management continued to steer the company through the downturn during  by seeking to increase procurement efficiencies  overhead rationalization  and working capital improvements above and beyond levels that had been achieved in in addition  management set out to reduce debt and refinance long term debt set to mature over the next three years 
the following financial information reflects the results of management s achievements in sales of  a increase over  selling  general administrative  and other expenses of less than  the lowest level since  income from continuing operations of  or per diluted share  an improvement of  compared to  cash from operations of  highest since  capital expenditures of  a reduction of more than from cash on hand at the end of the year of  in excess of  for the second consecutive year  reduction in total debt of  and  over the past two years  and debt to capital ratio of  a basis point improvement for the second consecutive year 
management is projecting a increase in the global consumption of primary aluminum in  similar to the improvement in china  india  brazil  and russia are all expected to have double digit increases in aluminum demand 
management also anticipates market conditions for aluminum products in all global end markets to improve  particularly in aerospace  automotive  and industrial gas turbine 
on the cost side  energy prices and currency movements are expected to continue to be a challenge 
management has established and is committed to achieving the following specific goals in sustaining the savings realized in and from procurement  overhead  and working capital programs  generating positive cash flow from operations that will exceed capital spending  and maintaining a debt to capital ratio between and 
looking ahead over the next three to five years  the company has established aggressive goals  focusing on cost reductions for the upstream operations and significant profitable growth in the midstream and downstream operations 

table of contents results of operations earnings summary income from continuing operations attributable to alcoa for was  or per diluted share  compared with a loss from continuing operations of  or per share  in the improvement of  in continuing operations was primarily due to the following continued increases in realized prices for alumina and aluminum  ongoing net costs savings and productivity improvements across all segments  and the absence of both a charge associated with a european commission electricity pricing matter in italy and a loss on the sale of an equity investment  partially offset by net unfavorable foreign currency movements  higher energy costs  unfavorable changes in lifo last in  first out inventories  additional depreciation charges and operating costs for growth projects  and the absence of gains on the exchange of equity interests and on the acquisition of bauxite and refinery interests 
loss from continuing operations attributable to alcoa for was  or per share  compared with income from continuing operations of  or per share  in the decline of  in continuing operations was primarily due to the following significant declines in realized prices for alumina and aluminum  large volume decreases in the midstream and downstream operations  a charge associated with a european commission electricity pricing matter in italy  a loss on the sale of an equity investment  charges related to restructuring programs  and higher depreciation and interest charges  all of which was partially offset by procurement and overhead cost savings across all businesses  the absence of the charges associated with restructuring programs  net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar  favorable lifo inventory adjustments  various discrete income tax benefits and a significant fluctuation in income taxes due to a change in the results of operations from pretax income to a pretax loss  a gain on the exchange of equity interests  a gain on the acquisition of an entity in the republic of suriname  and net income of various other nonoperating items 
net income attributable to alcoa for was  or per share  compared with a net loss of  or per share  in  and a net loss of  or per share  in in  the net income of included a loss from discontinued operations of  and in and  the net loss of  and included a loss from discontinued operations of  and  respectively 
in march  alcoa announced a series of operational and financial actions  which were in addition to those announced at the end of  to significantly improve alcoa s cost structure and liquidity 
operational actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs and working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements 
financial actions included a reduction in the quarterly common stock dividend from per share to per share  which began with the dividend paid on may   and the issuance of million shares of common stock and in convertible notes that collectively yielded  in net proceeds 
in january  alcoa announced further operational actions to not only maintain the procurement and overhead savings and working capital improvements achieved in  but to improve on them throughout also  a further reduction in capital expenditures was planned in order to achieve the level necessary to sustain operations without sacrificing the quality of alcoa s alumina and aluminum products 
in late  management made the decision to reduce alcoa s aluminum and alumina production in response to the then significant economic downturn 
as a result of this decision  reductions of kmt  or  of annualized output from alcoa s global smelting system were implemented includes previous curtailment at rockdale  tx in june 
accordingly  reductions in alumina output were also initiated with a plan to reduce production by  kmt per year across the global refining system 
the aluminum and alumina production curtailments were completed in early as planned 
smelters in rockdale kmt per year and tennessee kmt per year were fully curtailed while another kmt per year was partially curtailed at various other locations 
the refinery in point comfort  tx was partially curtailed by approximately  kmt per year between the end of and the beginning of kmt per year remains curtailed as of december  
in mid  further action became necessary resulting in the decision to fully curtail the massena east  ny smelter kmt per year and partially curtail the suralco suriname refinery kmt per year represented alcoa world alumina and chemicals awac previous ownership interest at the time of curtailment total curtailed is approximately kmt 

table of contents in the first half of  alcoa plans to restart certain idled potlines at three smelters located in the us massena east  ny three potlines or kmt per year  wenatchee  wa one potline or kmt per year  and ferndale  wa intalco kmt per year 
these restarts are expected to increase alcoa s aluminum production by kmt during and by kmt on an annual basis thereafter and are occurring to help meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand and to meet obligations outlined in power agreements with energy providers 
in june  alcoa temporarily idled half of the aluminum production three of six operating potlines or kmt at its rockdale smelter due to ongoing power supply issues with rockdale s onsite supplier and the uneconomical power that alcoa was forced to purchase in the open market as a result of such issues 
in september  alcoa announced it was temporarily idling the remaining three potlines  or kmt  as a result of the cumulative effect of operating only half of the smelter  well known issues regarding the cost and long term reliability of the power supply  and overall market conditions 
in  the earnings impact of the idled potlines was pretax 
alcoa sought damages and other relief from its power supplier through litigation in  a trial was held and the verdict resulted in no award of monetary damages to alcoa although the company may submit certain disputed amounts up to to accounting arbitration and may audit the books and record of its power supplier 
additionally  in conjunction with the idling of all six potlines  alcoa recorded restructuring charges in of pretax mostly for the layoff of approximately employees see restructuring and other charges below for additional information 
also in june  a major gas supplier to alcoa s western australia refining operations part of alcoa of australia suffered a pipeline rupture and fire  which resulted in a complete shutdown of the supplier s gas production operations at a certain hub and a declaration of force majeure by the supplier to all customers 
the disruption in gas supply caused an immediate reduction in alcoa of australia s production capacity and required the purchase of alternative fuel at a much higher cost than the natural gas displaced resulting in a significant negative impact on operations 
as a result  shortly thereafter  alcoa of australia notified its own customers that it was declaring force majeure under its alumina supply contracts 
during the second half of  the supplier partially restored the gas supply to alcoa of australia full restoration occurred in the first half of 
in addition  insurance recoveries of were received in the second half of net of insurance benefits  alcoa s earnings impact of the disruption in gas supply was before tax and noncontrolling interest in the alumina segment was impacted by before tax and the remaining impact of before tax was reflected in corporate due to alcoa s captive insurance program 
in  additional insurance recoveries of were received  which benefited the results of alcoa by before tax and noncontrolling interest and the alumina segment by before tax 
alcoa of australia is part of awac  which is owned by alcoa and owned by alumina limited 
sales sales for were  compared with sales of  in  an improvement of  or 
the increase was mainly driven by a continued rise in realized prices for alumina and aluminum  as a result of significantly higher london metal exchange lme prices  favorable pricing in the midstream operations  and sales from the smelters in norway acquired on march  increase of  slightly offset by the absence of sales from divested businesses transportation products europe and most of global foil decrease of and unfavorable mix in the downstream operations 
sales for were  compared with sales of  in  a decline of  or 
the decrease was primarily due to a drop in realized prices for alumina and aluminum  driven by significantly lower lme prices  volume declines in the midstream and downstream operations due to continued weak end markets  unfavorable foreign currency movements  mostly the result of a weaker euro and australian dollar  and the absence of sales from the businesses within the former packaging and consumer segment in  all of which was slightly offset by sales from the acquired smelters in norway increase of 
cost of goods sold cogs as a percentage of sales was in compared with in the percentage was positively impacted by the continued significant rise in realized prices for alumina and aluminum  net cost savings and productivity improvements across all segments  and the absence of a charge related to a european commission s decision on electricity pricing for smelters in italy  somewhat offset by net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar  unfavorable lifo adjustments  as a result of the considerable rise in 
table of contents lme prices  and a significantly smaller reduction in lifo inventory quantities  increases in energy costs  and higher operating costs for brazil growth projects placed in service 
cogs as a percentage of sales was in compared with in the percentage was negatively impacted by significant declines in realized prices for alumina and aluminum  lower demand in the midstream and downstream operations  and a charge related to a european commission s decision on electricity pricing for smelters in italy 
these items were somewhat offset by procurement and overhead cost savings across all businesses  net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar  and positive lifo adjustments 
in  alcoa recognized after tax in income due to the reductions in lifo inventory quantities and the considerable drop in lme prices 
of this amount  occurred in the second half of the year 
selling  general administrative  and other expenses sg a expenses were  or of sales  in compared with  or of sales  in the decline of was mostly due to continued reductions in expenses for contractors and consultants  lower deferred compensation  as a result of a decline in plan performance  and decreases in bad debt expense and information technology expenditures 
an increase in labor costs  principally due to higher annual incentive and performance compensation and employee benefits costs employer matching savings plan contributions for us salaried participants were suspended during somewhat offset the aforementioned expense reductions 
sg a expenses were  or of sales  in compared with  or of sales  in the decline of was primarily due to reductions in labor costs  mainly as a result of implemented severance programs  decreases in expenses for travel  contractors and consultants  information technology  selling and marketing  and various other administrative items as part of alcoa s cost reduction initiatives  the absence of the businesses within the former packaging and consumer segment in  and a decrease in bad debt expense  all of which was partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation  mostly the result of the plans improved performance  and an increase due to sg a of the acquired smelters in norway 
research and development expenses r d expenses were in compared with in and in the increase in as compared to was mainly driven by incremental increases across varying expenses necessary to support r d activities 
the decline in as compared to was principally due to the implementation of alcoa s cost reduction initiatives and the absence of the businesses within the former packaging and consumer segment in 
provision for depreciation  depletion  and amortization the provision for dd a was  in compared with  in the increase of  or  was principally the result of the assets placed into service during the second half of related to the juruti bauxite mine development and s o lu s refinery expansion in brazil  the smelters in norway acquired on march   the new bohai china flat rolled product facility  and a high quality coated sheet line at the samara russia facility  slightly offset by the cessation in dd a due to the decision to permanently shutdown and demolish two us smelters in early see restructuring and other charges below 
the provision for dd a was  in compared with  in the increase of  or  was mostly due to the acquired smelters in norway and assets placed into service during  including the juruti bauxite mine and s o luis refinery in brazil  the new bohai flat rolled product facility  and a high quality coated sheet line at the samara facility 
these increases were slightly offset as a result of the cessation of dd a  which began in january  related to the global foil and transportation products europe businesses due to the classification of these businesses as held for sale and a reduction in dd a as a result of the extension of depreciable lives for the majority of rolled products and hard alloy extrusions locations based upon a review  which was completed in mid  of estimated useful lives 
table of contents restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges for each year in the three year period ended december  were comprised of the following asset impairments layoff costs other exit costs reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs restructuring and other charges actions in  alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of after tax and noncontrolling interests  which were comprised of the following components after tax and noncontrolling interests in asset impairments and after tax and noncontrolling interests in other exit costs related to the permanent shutdown and planned demolition of certain idled structures at five us locations see below  after tax and noncontrolling interests for the layoff of approximately employees in the engineered products and solutions segment  in the primary metals segment  in the flat rolled products segment  in the alumina segment  and in corporate  after tax in net charges including after tax for asset impairments related to divested and to be divested businesses automotive castings  global foil  transportation products europe  and packaging and consumer for  among other items  the settlement of a contract with a former customer  foreign currency movements  working capital adjustments  and a tax indemnification  after tax and noncontrolling interests for various other exit costs  and after tax and noncontrolling interests for the reversal of prior periods layoff reserves  including a portion of those related to the portovesme smelter in italy due to the execution of a new power agreement 
in early  management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the following structures  each of which was previously temporarily idled for different reasons the eastalco smelter located in frederick  md capacity of kmt per year  the smelter located in badin  nc capacity of kmt per year  an aluminum fluoride plant in point comfort  tx  a paste plant and cast house in massena  ny  and one potline at the smelter in warrick  in capacity of kmt per year 
this decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility 
factors leading to this decision included current market fundamentals  cost competitiveness  other existing idle capacity  required future capital investment  and restart costs  as well as the elimination of ongoing holding costs 
the asset impairments of represent the write off of the remaining book value of properties  plants  and equipment related to these facilities 
additionally  remaining inventories  mostly operating supplies  were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of after tax and noncontrolling interests  which was recorded in cogs 
the other exit costs of represent after tax and noncontrolling interests in asset retirement obligations and after tax in environmental remediation  both triggered by the decision to permanently shutdown and demolish these structures  and after tax and noncontrolling interests in other related costs 
as of december   approximately of the employees were terminated 
the remaining terminations are expected to be completed by the end of in  cash payments of were made against layoff reserves related to restructuring programs 
actions in  alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of after tax and noncontrolling interests  which were comprised of the following components after tax and noncontrolling interests for the layoff of approximately  employees  in the engineered products and solutions segment   in the flat rolled products segment   in the primary metals segment  in the alumina segment  and in corporate to address the impact of the global economic downturn on alcoa s businesses and a after tax curtailment charge due to the remeasurement of pension plans as a result of the workforce reductions  after tax in adjustments to the global foil and transportation products europe businesses held for sale due to unfavorable foreign currency movements for both businesses and a change in the estimated fair value for the global foil business 
table of contents and after tax in other asset impairments  after tax for the write off of previously capitalized third party costs related to potential business acquisitions due to the adoption of changes to accounting for business combinations and net charges of after tax and noncontrolling interests for various other items  such as accelerated depreciation and lease termination costs for shutdown facilities  and after tax and noncontrolling interests for reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs due to normal attrition and changes in facts and circumstances 
as of december   approximately  of the  employees were terminated 
the total number of employees associated with restructuring programs was updated to reflect changes in plans eg  the previously mentioned new power agreement at the portovesme smelter in italy see activity above  natural attrition  and other factors 
the remaining terminations are expected to be completed by the end of in and  cash payments of and  respectively  were made against layoff reserves related to restructuring programs 
actions in late  alcoa took specific actions to reduce costs and strengthen its portfolio  partly due to the economic downturn 
such actions included targeted reductions  curtailments  and plant closures and consolidations  which will reduce headcount by approximately  resulting in layoff charges of after tax and noncontrolling interests  asset impairments of after tax and noncontrolling interests  and other exit costs of after tax 
the significant components of these actions were as follows as a result of market conditions  the primary metals segment reduced production by thousand metric tons kmt and the alumina segment reduced production by a total of  kmt fully implemented in early  further reductions occurred later in 
these production curtailments as well as targeted reductions will result in the elimination of approximately  positions totaling in layoff costs 
asset impairments of related to these two segments were also recognized  including the write off of in engineering costs related to a  kmt planned expansion of jamalco s clarendon  jamaica refinery 
the flat rolled products segment was restructured through the following actions restructuring and downsizing of the mill products businesses in europe and north america  resulting in severance charges of for the reduction of approximately positions  alignment of production with demand at operations in russia  through the elimination of approximately  positions resulting in severance charges of  the shutdown of the foil business in bohai  resulting in severance charges of for the reduction of approximately positions  asset impairments of  and other exits costs of  primarily related to lease termination costs 
the engineered products and solutions segment was restructured through the following actions exiting of the auto cast wheel business  through the closure of the only remaining facility  which employed approximately  by june for severance costs of  consolidation of operations in the building and construction systems business to maximize operating efficiencies and align capacity with the decline in the commercial building and construction markets  resulting in severance charges of for the elimination of approximately positions  alignment of production with demand across the power and propulsion business  resulting in the reduction of approximately positions for a cost of  optimization of the global hard alloy extrusion operations  resulting in severance charges of for a headcount reduction of approximately and asset impairments of  other severance charges of for the elimination of approximately positions  asset impairments of  and other exit costs of in order to reduce overhead serving various businesses  approximately positions were eliminated at corporate  resulting in severance charges of and other exits costs of 
table of contents in addition to the above actions  alcoa intends to sell its global foil the sabi nigo  spain and shanghai  china plants were sold in late and transportation products europe sold in businesses in order to streamline its portfolio 
as a result of this decision  the assets and related liabilities of the global foil and transportation products europe businesses were classified as held for sale 
asset impairments of after tax and after tax were recognized to reflect the estimated fair values of the global foil and transportation products europe businesses  respectively 
also  alcoa and orkla asa agreed to exchange their stakes in the sapa ab and elkem aluminium ans joint ventures 
this portfolio action resulted in an impairment charge of after tax to reflect the estimated fair value of alcoa s investment in sapa ab 
earlier in  alcoa recorded after tax in charges  which consisted of after tax for the layoff of approximately employees and related curtailment of postretirement benefits and after tax for other exit costs  associated with the complete production curtailment of the rockdale  tx smelter kmt due to ongoing power supply issues with rockdale s onsite supplier and the uneconomical power that alcoa was forced to purchase in the open market as a result of such issues 
also during  alcoa recorded a loss of after tax on the sale of its packaging and consumer businesses 
the remaining net charges in were comprised of after tax and noncontrolling interests for layoff related to a reduction in headcount of approximately  for other exit costs after tax  and after tax and noncontrolling interests for reversals of previously recorded costs  slightly more than half of which related to the reversal of a reserve related to a shutdown facility 
as of december   the terminations associated with restructuring programs were essentially complete 
the total number of employees associated with restructuring programs was updated during to reflect changes in plans  natural attrition  and other factors resulting in terminations of approximately  previously 
in and  cash payments of and  respectively  were made against layoff reserves related to restructuring programs 
alcoa does not include restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments 
the pretax impact of allocating such charges to segment results would have been as follows alumina primary metals flat rolled products engineered products and solutions packaging and consumer segment total corporate total restructuring and other charges interest expense interest expense was in compared with in  resulting in an increase of  or 
the increase was principally caused by a decline in interest capitalized  mainly the result of placing the juruti and s o lu s growth projects in service during the second half of  and a net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes in purchase premiums paid partially offset by a gain for in the money interest rate swaps  mostly offset by a lower average debt level  primarily due to the absence of commercial paper resulting from alcoa s improved liquidity position  and lower amortization expense of financing costs  principally related to the fees paid fully amortized in october for the former  day senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

table of contents interest expense was in compared with in  resulting in an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily due to a higher average debt level  mostly the result of in convertible notes issued in march and increased borrowings on loans in brazil began in april related to the juruti  s o lu s  and estreito growth projects  and a significant increase in the amortization of debt costs  mainly due to a beneficial conversion option related to the convertible notes and in fees paid for the  day senior unsecured revolving credit facility entered into in october and expired in october  both of which were slightly offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of alcoa s debt portfolio 
other expenses income  net other expenses  net was in compared with other income  net of in the change of was mostly due to the absence of a gain on the elkem sapa ab exchange transaction  a gain related to the acquisition of a bhp billiton subsidiary in the republic of suriname  and a gain on the sale of property in vancouver  wa  net foreign currency losses  and a smaller improvement in the cash surrender value of company owned life insurance  partially offset by the absence of both a realized loss on the sale of the shining prospect investment and an equity loss related to alcoa s former equity stake in elkem  and a net favorable change of in mark to market derivative contracts 
other income  net was in compared with in the increase of was mainly the result of a gain on the elkem sapa ab exchange transaction  net foreign currency gains due to a stronger us dollar  net gains related to the improvement in the cash surrender value of company owned life insurance  a gain related to the acquisition of a bhp billiton subsidiary in the republic of suriname  and a gain on the sale of property in vancouver  wa 
these positive impacts were partially offset by a realized loss on the sale of the shining prospect investment  a decline in the value of mark to market derivative contracts  a decrease in equity income related to alcoa s share of the results of elkem  sapa ab  and shining prospect prior to the exchange and sale of these investments  the absence of a negotiated partial refund of an indemnification payment  and an estimated loss on excess power at the ferndale  wa smelter 
income taxes alcoa s effective tax rate was provision on income in compared with the us federal statutory rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions  a discrete income tax benefit for the reversal of a valuation allowance as a result of previously restricted net operating losses of a foreign subsidiary now available  a discrete income tax benefit related to a canadian provincial tax law change permitting a tax return to be filed in us dollars  and a net discrete income tax benefit for various other items  partially offset by a discrete income tax charge as a result of a change in the tax treatment of federal subsidies received related to prescription drug benefits provided under certain retiree health care benefit plans that were determined to be actuarially equivalent to medicare part d and a discrete income tax charge based on settlement discussions of several matters with international taxing authorities this amount represents a decrease to alcoa s unrecognized tax benefits 
alcoa s effective tax rate was benefit on a loss in compared with the us federal statutory rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate principally due to a income tax benefit related to the noncontrolling interests share of the gain associated with the acquisition of a bhp billiton subsidiary in the republic of suriname and the following discrete tax items a benefit for the reorganization of an equity investment  a benefit for the reversal of a valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets  a benefit for a tax rate change from to in iceland  a benefit related to a canadian tax law change allowing a tax return to be filed in us dollars  a benefit related to a change in the sale structure of two locations included in the global foil business than originally anticipated  and a benefit related to the elkem sapa ab exchange transaction 
partially offsetting these benefits were items related to smelter operations in italy  which included a valuation allowance placed on existing deferred tax assets and charges not tax benefitted as follows related to a recent decision by the european commission on electricity pricing  for environmental remediation  and for layoffs 
alcoa s effective tax rate was provision on income in compared with the us federal statutory rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the following income tax charges for the asset impairments included in the restructuring program  due to a decrease in deferred 
table of contents tax assets of the iceland operations as a result of an applicable tax rate change from to  a net associated with the sale of the packaging and consumer businesses  mainly due to the allocation of sale proceeds to higher tax rate jurisdictions as opposed to the allocation previously contemplated  somewhat offset by changes in tax assumptions surrounding transaction costs and the finalization of the divestiture of certain foreign locations 
these charges were partially offset by foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions and a discrete income tax benefit related to the filing of the us income tax return 
management anticipates that the effective tax rate in will be approximately 
however  changes in the current economic environment  tax legislation  currency fluctuations  and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate 
noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was in compared with in the increase of was mostly due to higher earnings at awac  which is owned by alcoa and by alumina limited 
the improved earnings at awac were attributed primarily to a continued rise in realized prices  partially offset by net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar  higher depreciation expense and operating costs related to the juruti and s o lu s growth projects placed into service in the second half of  and the absence of a gain recognized on the acquisition of a bhp billiton subsidiary in the republic of suriname 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was in compared with in the decline of was principally due to lower earnings at awac  mainly driven by a significant drop in realized prices  somewhat offset by the gain related to the acquisition of a bhp billiton subsidiary in the republic of suriname and the absence of the impact of the gas outage in western australia 
loss from discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations in was comprised of an additional loss of pretax related to the wire harness and electrical portion of the ees business as a result of a contract settlement with a former customer of this business and an additional loss of pretax related to the electronics portion of the ees business for the settling of working capital  which was not included in the divestiture transaction 
loss from discontinued operations in was comprised of a pretax loss on the divestiture of the wire harness and electrical portion of the ees business  a pretax loss on the divestiture of the electronics portion of the ees business  and the remainder was for the operational results of the ees business prior to the divestitures 
loss from discontinued operations in was comprised of asset impairments of pretax to reflect the estimated fair value of the ees business and a net operating loss of pretax  which included restructuring charges of pretax for headcount reductions of approximately  and a charge of pretax for obsolete inventory 
in late  alcoa reclassified the ees business to discontinued operations based on the decision to divest the business 
the divestiture of the wire harness and electrical portion of the ees business was completed in june and the divestiture of the electronics portion of the ees business was completed in december the results of the engineered products and solutions segment were reclassified to reflect the movement of the ees business into discontinued operations 
segment information alcoa s operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments alumina  primary metals  flat rolled products  and engineered products and solutions the packaging and consumer segment no longer contains any operations as the businesses within this segment were divested during 
segment performance under alcoa s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors  however  the primary measure of performance is the after tax operating income atoi of each segment 
certain items such as the impact of lifo inventory accounting  
table of contents interest expense  noncontrolling interests  corporate expense general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities  along with depreciation and amortization on corporate owned assets  restructuring and other charges  discontinued operations  and other items  including intersegment profit eliminations and other metal adjustments  differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate  the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil  and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gains losses and interest income are excluded from segment atoi 
atoi for all reportable segments totaled  in  in  and  in see note q to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this form k for additional information 
the following discussion provides shipments  sales  and atoi data for each reportable segment and production data for the alumina and primary metals segments for each of the three years in the period ended december  alumina alumina production kmt third party alumina shipments kmt third party sales intersegment sales total sales atoi this segment known as upstream operations consists of alcoa s worldwide alumina system  including the mining of bauxite  which is then refined into alumina 
alumina is mainly sold directly to internal and external smelter customers worldwide or is sold to customers who process it into industrial chemical products 
a portion of this segment s third party sales are completed through the use of agents  alumina traders  and distributors 
slightly more than half of alcoa s alumina production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide  while the remainder is used internally 
in  alumina production increased by  kmt compared to the increase was mainly driven by the point comfort  tx refinery as most of the  kmt per year curtailment initiated between the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of has been restored 
in addition  production included the continued ramp up of the s o lu s  brazil refinery expansion  which began in late the alumina segment s share is approximately  kmt per year and the interest in the suralco suriname refinery acquired in mid in  alumina production decreased by kmt compared to the reduction was mostly the result of the effects of curtailments initiated in late through early  which included approximately  kmt per year at the point comfort refinery and approximately kmt per year at the suralco refinery represented awac s previous ownership interest at the time of curtailment total curtailed is approximately kmt 
partially offsetting the curtailments was increased production at the following refineries all set production records in jamalco jamaica  pinjarra and wagerup australia  and s o luis  where ramp up of the  kmt expansion began in late production also increased due to additional capacity of approximately kmt from the acquisition total acquired was approximately kmt was curtailed of bhp billiton s interest in suralco on july  of the suralco refinery s operations were reflected in this segment beginning august  
third party sales for the alumina segment rose in compared with  primarily related to a increase in realized prices  driven by significantly higher lme prices  coupled with a increase in volumes 
third party sales for this segment declined in compared with  principally due to a drop in realized prices  driven by significantly lower lme prices  and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker australian dollar  both of which were somewhat offset by an increase in volumes 

table of contents intersegment sales for the alumina segment climbed in compared with  mainly as a result of higher realized prices and an increase in demand from the primary metals segment 
intersegment sales for this segment dropped in compared with  mostly due to a drop in realized prices and a reduction in demand from the primary metals segment

primary metals aluminum production kmt third party aluminum shipments kmt alcoa s average realized price per metric ton of aluminum third party sales intersegment sales total sales atoi this segment known as upstream operations consists of alcoa s worldwide smelter system 
primary metals receives alumina  mostly from the alumina segment  and produces primary aluminum used by alcoa s fabricating businesses  as well as sold to external customers  aluminum traders  and commodity markets 
results from the sale of aluminum powder  scrap  and excess power are also included in this segment  as well as the results of aluminum derivative contracts and buy resell activity 
primary aluminum produced by alcoa and used internally is transferred to other segments at prevailing market prices 
the sale of primary aluminum represents more than of this segment s third party sales 
buy resell activity refers to when this segment purchases metal from external or internal sources and resells such metal to external customers or the midstream and downstream segments in order to maximize smelting system efficiency and to meet customer requirements 
at december   alcoa had kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of  kmt

production was restarted a few months after the flood and the smelter was at full operating rate by the end of base capacity dropped kmt between december  and due to the previously mentioned permanent curtailments 
the decision to permanently curtail these facilities was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility 
factors leading to this decision included current market fundamentals  cost competitiveness  other existing idle capacity  required future capital investment  and restart costs  as well as the elimination of ongoing holding costs 
at december   alcoa had  kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of  kmt 
in  idle capacity increased by kmt compared to due to the completion of targeted curtailment reductions  including the tennessee smelter kmt per year  the massena east  ny smelter kmt per year  and kmt at various other smelters  in response to the significant decline in lme prices and aluminum demand both as a result of the then global economic downturn

in  management continued to face the significant challenge of maintaining this approach while providing the company with the necessary liquidity to operate effectively as the global economy continues to recover from the economic downturn that began in in response to changes in the economic markets across the globe in the second half of  management initiated the following actions to conserve cash and preserve liquidity greater scrutiny over the daily management of alcoa s cash position  higher risk tolerance on raw materials with lower minimum order quantities and lower carrying levels  targeted headcount reductions across the globe  a global salary and hiring freeze lifted at the beginning of  suspension of the existing share repurchase program expired in december  and the addition of a new day  revolving credit facility expired in october 
a number of changes were also made to alcoa s capital expenditures strategy as follows capital expenditure approval levels were lowered dramatically  growth projects were halted where it was deemed economically feasible  and all non critical capital expenditures were stopped 
capital expenditures are deemed critical if they maintain alcoa s compliance with the law  keep a facility operating  or satisfy customer requirements if the benefits outweigh the costs 
the planned sale or shutdown of various businesses contributed positively to alcoa s liquidity position in in march  alcoa announced an additional series of operational and financial actions to significantly improve the company s cost structure and liquidity 
operational actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs and working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements 
financial actions included a reduction in the quarterly common stock dividend from per share to per share  which began with the dividend paid on may   and the issuance of million shares of common stock and in convertible notes that collectively yielded  in net proceeds 
in january  alcoa announced further operational actions to not only maintain the procurement and overhead savings and working capital improvements achieved in  but to improve on them throughout also  a further reduction in capital expenditures was planned in order to achieve the level necessary to sustain operations without sacrificing the quality of alcoa s alumina and aluminum products

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments  estimates  and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes 
areas that require significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions include accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  environmental and litigation matters  asset retirement obligations  the testing of goodwill  equity investments  and properties  plants  and equipment for impairment  estimating fair value of businesses to be divested  pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments  estimates  and assumptions  and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company s consolidated financial statements at any given time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this form k 
management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 

table of contents derivatives and hedging 
derivatives are held for purposes other than trading and are part of a formally documented risk management program 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing  at least quarterly  the historical high correlation of changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing  at least quarterly  the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument 
the ineffective portions of both types of hedges are recorded in sales or other income or expense in the current period 
if the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur  future gains or losses on the derivative are recorded in other income or expense 
alcoa accounts for interest rate swaps related to its existing long term debt and hedges of firm customer commitments for aluminum as fair value hedges 
as a result  the fair values of the derivatives and changes in the fair values of the underlying hedged items are reported in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
changes in the fair values of these derivatives and underlying hedged items generally offset and are recorded each period in sales or interest expense  consistent with the underlying hedged item 
alcoa accounts for hedges of foreign currency exposures and certain forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges 
the fair values of the derivatives are recorded in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the effective portions of the changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income and are reclassified to sales  cost of goods sold  or other income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged items or in the period that the transaction no longer qualifies as a cash flow hedge 
these contracts cover the same periods as known or expected exposures  generally not exceeding five years 
if no hedging relationship is designated  the derivative is marked to market through earnings 
cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the statement of consolidated cash flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions 
environmental matters 
expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized  as appropriate 
expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations  which will not contribute to future revenues  are expensed 
liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the liability may include costs such as site investigations  consultant fees  feasibility studies  outside contractors  and monitoring expenses 
estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery 
claims for recovery are recognized as agreements are reached with third parties 
the estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that alcoa has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share 
the liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress  prospective estimates of required activity  and other factors that may be relevant  including changes in technology or regulations 
litigation matters 
for asserted claims and assessments  liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable 
management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter  available defenses and case strategy  progress of the matter  views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors  applicability and success of appeals processes  and the outcome of similar historical matters  among others 
once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable  management weighs the probability of estimated losses  and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded 
if an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible  then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded 
with respect to unasserted claims or assessments  management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely  then  a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made 
legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis or sooner if significant changes in matters have occurred to determine if a change in the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a loss is necessary 

table of contents asset retirement obligations 
alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations aros related to legal obligations associated with the normal operation of alcoa s bauxite mining  alumina refining  and aluminum smelting facilities 
these aros consist primarily of costs associated with spent pot lining disposal  closure of bauxite residue areas  mine reclamation  and landfill closure 
alcoa also recognizes aros for any significant lease restoration obligation  if required by a lease agreement  and for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to the demolition of certain power facilities 
the fair values of these aros are recorded on a discounted basis  at the time the obligation is incurred  and accreted over time for the change in present value 
additionally  alcoa capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life 
certain conditional asset retirement obligations caros related to alumina refineries  aluminum smelters  and fabrication facilities have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date 
a caro is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within alcoa s control 
such uncertainties exist as a result of the perpetual nature of the structures  maintenance and upgrade programs  and other factors 
at the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement date can be made  alcoa would record a retirement obligation for the removal  treatment  transportation  storage and or disposal of various regulated assets and hazardous materials such as asbestos  underground and aboveground storage tanks  polychlorinated biphenyls  various process residuals  solid wastes  electronic equipment waste  and various other materials 
such amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are recorded 
if alcoa was required to demolish all such structures immediately  the estimated caro as of december  ranges from less than to per structure structures in today s dollars 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  instead  it is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  or slower growth rates  among others 
it is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
alcoa has nine reporting units  of which five are included in the engineered products and solutions segment 
the remaining four reporting units are the alumina segment  the primary metals segment  the flat rolled products segment  and the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil  which is included in corporate 
almost of alcoa s total goodwill is allocated to three reporting units as follows alcoa fastening systems afs  and alcoa power and propulsion app  businesses  both of which are included in the engineered products and solutions segment  and primary metals 
these amounts include an allocation of corporate goodwill 
in  the estimated fair values of all nine reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values  resulting in no impairment 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
alcoa uses a discounted cash flow model dcf model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment  as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  costs to produce  tax rates  capital spending  discount rate  and working capital changes 
most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units 
cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years 
the betas used in calculating the individual reporting units weighted average cost of capital wacc rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts 
in the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the dcf model is less than the carrying value  additional analysis would be required 
the additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s 
table of contents goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill  which may involve the use of valuation experts 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized  which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders equity 
equity investments 
alcoa invests in a number of privately held companies  primarily through joint ventures and consortiums  which are accounted for on the equity method 
the equity method is applied in situations where alcoa has the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over the investee 
management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain indicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable 
this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment from management to identify events or circumstances indicating that an equity investment is impaired 
the following items are examples of impairment indicators significant  sustained declines in an investee s revenue  earnings  and cash flow trends  adverse market conditions of the investee s industry or geographic area  the investee s ability to continue operations measured by several items  including liquidity  and other factors 
once an impairment indicator is identified  management uses considerable judgment to determine if the impairment is other than temporary  in which case the equity investment is written down to its estimated fair value 
an impairment that is other than temporary could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations 
properties  plants  and equipment 
properties  plants  and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets asset group to their carrying amount 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows 
the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets asset group over their fair value  with fair value determined using the best information available  which generally is a dcf model 
the determination of what constitutes an asset group  the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows  and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments 
discontinued operations and assets held for sale 
the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model  valuations performed by third parties  earnings multiples  or indicative bids  when available 
a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques  including the forecasting of markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  costs and expenses  and multiple other factors 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made  however  the fair values that are ultimately realized upon the sale of the businesses to be divested may differ from the estimated fair values reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions  including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases  medical costs  retirement age  and mortality 
the interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a company specific yield curve model above median developed with the assistance of an external actuary 
the cash flows of the plans projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds  which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors  including finance and banking  manufacturing  transportation  insurance  and pharmaceutical  among others 
the yield curve model parallels the plans projected cash flows  which have an average duration of years  and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company s plans obligations multiple times 
the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of of would be approximately and either a charge or credit of to after tax earnings in the following year 

table of contents the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five year market related value of plan assets a four year average or the fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non us plans 
the process used by management to develop this assumption has expanded from one that relied primarily on historical asset return information to one that also incorporates forward looking returns by asset class  as described below 
prior to developing the expected long term rate of return for calendar year  management focused on historical actual returns annual  year moving  and year moving averages when developing this assumption 
based on that process  management utilized for the expected long term rate of return for several years through for calendar year  the expected long term rate of return was reduced to due to lower future expected market returns as a result of the then global economic downturn 
this was supported by the fact that  in  the year moving average of actual performance fell below for the first time in years  although the year moving average continued to exceed 
for calendar year  management expanded its process by incorporating expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and management s own judgment 
management considered this forward looking analysis as well as the historical return information  and concluded the expected rate of return for calendar would remain at  which was between the year moving average actual return performance and the estimated future return developed by asset class 
for calendar year  management again incorporated both actual historical return information and expected future returns into its analysis 
based on strategic asset allocations and current estimates of future returns by asset class  management will be using as its expected long term rate of return for this rate again falls within the range of the year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class 
a change in the assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of of would impact after tax earnings by approximately for in  a net charge of after tax was recorded in other comprehensive income  primarily due to a basis point decrease in the discount rate  which was somewhat offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs 
in  a net charge of after tax was recorded in other comprehensive loss  primarily due to a basis point decrease in the discount rate  which was somewhat offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs 
additionally  in and  a charge of and  respectively  was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to the reclassification of deferred taxes related to the medicare part d prescription drug subsidy 
stock based compensation 
alcoa recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non substantive vesting period approach  in which the expense net of estimated forfeitures is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value 
the fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice pricing model 
determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment  including estimates for the average risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility  annual forfeiture rate  and exercise behavior 
these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 
as part of alcoa s stock based compensation plan design  individuals who are retirement eligible have a six month requisite service period in the year of grant 
equity grants are issued in january each year 
as a result  a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each year for these retirement eligible employees 
compensation expense recorded in   and was after tax  after tax  and after tax  respectively 
of this amount    and in   and  respectively  pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirement eligible employees 
plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options  stock awards  or a combination of both 
this choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable 

table of contents income taxes 
the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes 
under this approach  the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year 
deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid  and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of alcoa s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  management considers all potential sources of taxable income  including income available in carryback periods  future reversals of taxable temporary differences  projections of taxable income  and income from tax planning strategies  as well as all positive and negative evidence 
positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations  projections of future profitability within the carryforward period  including from tax planning strategies  and the company s experience with similar operations 
existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence 
negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses  projections of future losses  or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income 
deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances 
tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold 
otherwise  these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled  which means that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open 
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized
