overview we are a leading global high technology filtration company that develops  manufactures and markets specialized microporous membranes used in separation and filtration processes 
in fiscal  we generated total net sales of million 
we operate in two business segments i the energy storage segment  which accounted for approximately of our fiscal net sales  and ii the separations media segment  which accounted for approximately of our fiscal net sales 
we manufacture our products at facilities in north america  europe and asia 
net sales from foreign locations were million for fiscal we are experiencing strong demand in both of our business segments and have significant capacity expansions underway that are scheduled to come online in early through mid we operated at high rates of capacity utilization in and expect that to continue into early  when some of the new capacity begins to ramp up 
we believe long term demand drivers in our businesses remain positive  and we will continue to assess capacity needs and make investments to capitalize on these future growth opportunities 
energy storage segment in the energy storage segment  our membrane separators are a critical performance component in lithium batteries  which are primarily used in consumer electronics and electric drive vehicle edv applications  and lead acid batteries  which are used globally in transportation and numerous industrial applications 
we believe that the long term growth drivers for the energy storage business growth in asia  strong demand for consumer electronics and growing demand for edv are positive 
lithium batteries are the power source in a wide variety of applications  including consumer electronics applications such as notebook computers  tablets  mobile phones and cordless power tools  and emerging applications such as edv and electricity grid storage or energy storage systems 
table of contents ess 
growth in lithium batteries is being driven by strong demand in consumer electronic applications and accelerating demand in edv 
in order to meet the growing demand  we have four lithium capacity expansion projects underway  three of which are targeted at the edv market and one for consumer electronics in asia 
in late  we initiated a million edv targeted expansion that is being partially funded by a million grant from the us department of energy doe 
the first phase of this expansion will increase capacity at our existing charlotte  nc facility  with production ramping up in early the second phase is the construction of a new lithium battery separator facility in concord  nc which is expected to start production in mid in november  we announced another edv targeted expansion at our charlotte  nc facility 
this million expansion is expected to begin production toward the end of for consumer electronics  we initiated a million capacity expansion at our korean facility that is expected to start up in the second half of in the lead acid battery market  the high proportion of aftermarket replacement sales and the steady growth of the worldwide fleet of motor vehicles provide us with a growing recurring revenue base in lead acid battery separators 
worldwide demand for lead acid battery separators is expected to continue to grow at slightly more than annual economic growth 
the asia pacific region is the fastest growing market for lead acid battery separators 
growth in this region is driven by the increasing penetration of automobile ownership  growth in industrial and manufacturing sectors  export incentives and ongoing conversion to the polyethylene based membrane separators we produce 
we have positioned ourselves to benefit from growth in asia by expanding capacity at our prachinburi  thailand facility  acquiring battery separator manufacturing assets and subsequently expanding our operations in bangalore  india  acquiring a production facility in tianjin  china  and establishing an asian technical center in thailand 
in  we reached an agreement to enter into a joint venture with a customer  camel group co  ltd 
camel  a leading battery manufacturer in china  to produce lead acid battery separators primarily for camel use 
the joint venture  daramic xiangfan battery separator co  ltd 
daramic xiangfan  will be located at camel facility in xiangfan  china and is expected to start production in early in february  we approved an additional expansion at our prachinburi  thailand facility to be completed by mid separations media segment in the separations media segment  our filtration membranes and modules are used in healthcare and high performance filtration and specialty applications 
we believe that the separations media segment will continue to benefit from continued growth in demand for higher levels of purity in a growing number of applications 
healthcare applications include hemodialysis  blood oxygenation and plasmapheresis 
growth in demand for hemodialysis membranes is driven by the increasing worldwide population of end stage renal disease patients 
we believe that conversion to single use dialyzers and increasing treatment frequency will result in additional dialyzer market growth 
in the third quarter of  we began a million expansion of hemodialysis membrane purema production capacity at our wuppertal  germany facility and expect to start production in the second half of we produce a wide range of membranes and membrane based elements for micro  ultra and nanofiltration and gasification degasification of liquids 
micro  ultra and nanofiltration membrane element market growth is being driven by several factors  including end market growth in applications such as water treatment and pharmaceutical processing  displacement of conventional filtration media by membrane filtration due to membranes superior cost and performance attributes and increasing purity requirements in industrial and other applications 

table of contents critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based on past experience and management judgment 
because of uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
for additional accounting policies  see note of the consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are primarily composed of amounts owed to us through our operating activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information 
we charge accounts receivables off against our allowance for doubtful accounts when we deem them to be uncollectible on a specific identification basis 
during  million of specifically reserved accounts receivable were deemed not collectible and written off against the related allowance for doubtful accounts 
the determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to judgment and estimated by management 
if circumstances or economic conditions deteriorate  we may need to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
impairment of intangibles and goodwill identified intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment testing unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments 
we perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than the carrying amount 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process performed at the reporting unit level 
our reporting units are at the operating segment level 
step one compares the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using the income approach  corroborated by comparison to market capitalization and key multiples of comparable companies 
under the income approach  we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit  discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  there is no impairment 
if the reporting unit carrying amount exceeds its fair value  then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
step two calculates the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one 
in this step  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the reporting unit assets and liabilities in a hypothetical purchase price allocation as if the reporting unit had been acquired on that date 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates  strategic plans and future market conditions  among others 
there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or margin growth rates of certain reporting units are not achieved or changes in strategy or market conditions occur  we may be required to record goodwill 
table of contents impairment charges in future periods 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
in  our annual impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts 
a decrease in the estimated free cash flow assumptions used in our step one test would have resulted in a reduction in fair values of approximately million for our energy storage segment and million for our separations media segment 
a increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a reduction in fair values of million for our energy storage segment and million for our separations media segment 
none of these changes would have resulted in an impairment charge to goodwill or intangible assets 
in  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million for the lead acid reporting unit of our energy storage segment 
pension and other postretirement benefits certain assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits 
two critical assumptions  discount rate and expected return on assets  are important elements of plan expense and or liability measurement and differences between actual results and these two actuarial assumptions can materially affect our projected benefit obligation or the valuation of our plan assets 
other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement  expected increases in compensation  mortality and turnover 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the discount rate assumptions are based on the market rate for high quality fixed income investments  and are thus subject to change each year 
at january   a decrease in the discount rate would increase our projected benefit obligations and the unfunded status of our pension plans by million 
the expected rates of return on our pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return of those assets 
for  if the expected rate of return on pension plan assets were reduced by  the result would have increased our net periodic benefit expense for fiscal by million 
at january   if the actual plan assets were reduced by  the unfunded status of our pension plans would increase by million 
environmental matters environmental obligations are accrued when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
the amount of liability recorded is based on currently available information  including the progress of remedial investigations  current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the method and extent of remediation  presently enacted laws and existing technology 
accruals for estimated losses from environmental obligations are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
we do not currently anticipate any material loss in excess of the amounts accrued 
future remediation expenses may be affected by a number of uncertainties including  but not limited to  the difficulty in estimating the extent and method of remediation  the evolving nature of environmental regulations and the availability and application of technology 
if actual results are less favorable than those projected by management  we may be required to recognize additional expense and liabilities 
in connection with the acquisition of membrana in  we recorded a reserve for environmental obligations 
the reserve provides for costs to remediate known environmental issues and operational upgrades which are required in order for us to remain in compliance with local regulations 
the initial estimate and subsequent finalization of the reserve was included in the allocation of purchase price at the date of acquisition 
at january   the environmental reserve for the membrana facility was million 
we anticipate that expenditures will be made over the next three to five years 

table of contents we have indemnification agreements for certain environmental matters from acordis and akzo  the prior owners of membrana 
akzo originally provided broad environmental protections to acordis with the right to assign such indemnities to acordis successors 
akzo indemnifications relate to conditions existing prior to december  which is the date that membrana was sold to acordis 
in addition to the akzo indemnification  acordis provides separate indemnification of claims incurred from december through february  the acquisition date 
we will receive indemnification payments under the indemnification agreements as expenditures are made against approved claims 
at january  amounts receivable under the indemnification agreements were million

lithium battery separator sales  while capacity constrained  increased by due to strong demand in consumer electronics and growing demand in edv 
lead acid battery separator sales 
table of contents increased by  including the impact of advance purchases of approximately million by a north american customer 
the increase was due to continued growth in asia and global economic improvement 
sales in asia  which is the fastest growing market for lead acid separators  increased in fiscal the impact of foreign currency translation was not significant for fiscal in the energy storage segment  we operated at high capacity utilization rates in and expect that to continue in the near term 
new capacity begins to ramp up for lithium battery separators in early and for lead acid battery separators in early separations media sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  from fiscal  including the negative effect of foreign currency translation of million 
healthcare sales increased by as demand in hemodialysis and blood oxygenation applications was somewhat offset by the effect of foreign currency translation 
our hemodialysis production operated at high capacity utilization rates in  and we expect that to continue in the near term 
new capacity is expected to come online in the second half of filtration and specialty product sales increased by due to economic improvement and strong demand in all key applications  somewhat offset by the effect of foreign currency translation 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percent of net sales was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal energy storage gross profit as a percent of net sales was as compared to for fiscal the increase in gross profit margin was due to higher production volumes and production efficiencies  somewhat offset by increased costs associated with growth investments 
separations media gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to product mix and production efficiencies 
in the third and fourth quarters of  filtration production was reduced because of lower sales related to the macro economic environment at that time 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million for fiscal  primarily due to growth investments and the accrual of variable incentives under performance based compensation plans 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal decreased by million from fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to million of additional interest expense recognized in the prior year under interest rate swap agreements that expired in fiscal  the capitalization of interest expense in related to capacity expansions and the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our euro denominated debt 
in late  we paid down million of our senior subordinated notes and refinanced the remaining senior subordinated notes by issuing million of new senior notes 
the repayment and refinancing of our senior subordinated notes will provide annual interest savings of approximately million 
income taxes 
income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income from continuing operations for fiscal were as compared to for fiscal the income tax expense recorded in the financial statements fluctuates between years due to a variety of factors  including state income taxes  the mix of income between us and foreign jurisdictions taxed at varying rates  changes in estimates of permanent differences and valuation allowances and the relative size of our consolidated income loss before income taxes 
in fiscal  the effective tax rate was also impacted by the goodwill impairment charge  which decreased pre tax income with no material corresponding income tax benefit 
the mix of earnings between the tax jurisdictions has a significant impact on our effective tax rate 
each tax jurisdiction has its own set of tax laws and tax rates and income earned by our subsidiaries is taxed independently by these various jurisdictions 
currently  the applicable statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate range from to 
therefore  the amount of income tax expense in each jurisdiction as compared to our consolidated income loss before income taxes has a significant impact on our annual effective tax rate 

table of contents the effect of each of these items on our effective tax rate is quantified in the table below fiscal fiscal us federal statutory rate state income taxes mix of income in taxing jurisdictions other permanent differences and valuation allowances impact of goodwill impairment other total effective tax rate fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
net sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal energy storage sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or 
lithium battery separator sales decreased by due to the impact of the weak economic environment on consumer electronics purchases 
lead acid battery separator sales decreased by  including the negative effect of foreign currency translation of million 
the primary reason for the decline in lead acid battery separator sales in fiscal was the loss of a customer at the end of fiscal sales to this customer in fiscal were million 
in addition  demand for our lead acid battery separators was negatively impacted by the economic environment  particularly in north america and europe 
sales to our largest customer decreased approximately million in in the third and fourth quarters of  we estimate that we shipped approximately million of advance orders to this customer for usage and demand 
demand in asia  which is the fastest growing market for lead acid separators  continues to be strong as sales in this region increased in fiscal separations media sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal  including the negative effect of foreign currency translation of million 
healthcare sales remained relatively consistent with fiscal as the impact of higher sales volumes of synthetic hemodialysis membranes was offset by the negative effect of foreign currency translation 
filtration and specialty product sales decreased by due to macro economic conditions and the negative effect of foreign currency translation 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percent of net sales was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal energy storage gross profit as a percent of net sales was as compared to for fiscal  which included incremental costs associated with a strike at the owensboro  kentucky lead acid battery separator facility 
excluding the strike related costs  gross profit as a percent of sales in remained relatively consistent with fiscal separations media gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase was due primarily to production efficiencies and decreased energy costs 
in the third and fourth quarter of  filtration production was reduced because of lower sales related to the macro economic environment 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million for fiscal excluding the effect of foreign currency translation  the decrease was million  consisting primarily of reduced discretionary spending and cost savings from the restructuring plan  partially offset by million of increased costs associated with the ftc litigation 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal decreased by million from fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower interest rates under our senior credit agreement and the positive effect of foreign currency translation on our euro denominated debt

restructuring plan 
in  the north american market for lead acid battery separators had significant excess capacity and a highly consolidated customer base 
as a result of these factors and our estimates at that time about future demand requirements in north america  we implemented a restructuring plan in our energy storage segment to better align lead acid battery separator production capacity with demand in north america 
the restructuring plan included idling capacity and reducing headcount at our manufacturing facility in owensboro  kentucky 
we recognized total costs in connection with the plan of million  consisting of million for severance and benefits and other exit costs and a non cash impairment of million for buildings and equipment 
during  due to economic improvement and growing demand in asia  worldwide demand for lead acid battery separators improved from previous estimates 
as a result  we are utilizing the previously idled portions of the facility and do not expect additional restructuring costs to be incurred 
restructuring plan 
a supply contract between our lead acid battery separator business and a large customer expired on december  and was not renewed 
in response  we implemented a restructuring plan for our energy storage segment to align lead acid battery separator production capacity with demand  reduce costs and position ourselves to meet future growth opportunities 
the plan included closing our facility in potenza  italy  streamlining production at our facility in owensboro  kentucky and reducing selling  general and administrative resources associated with the lead acid battery separator business 
the total cost of the restructuring plan  including million for environmental costs recorded in the environmental reserve for the potenza  italy facility  was million 
the restructuring plan included costs associated with closing the potenza  italy facility and the termination of production employees at potenza  italy and owensboro  kentucky and certain selling  general and administrative employees 
the restructuring charge also included a non cash impairment charge of million for buildings and machinery and equipment that will no longer be used in potenza  italy 
on march   we sold of the stock of our italian subsidiary  daramic srl as a result of the stock sale  the buyer acquired all assets and liabilities of daramic srl  including restructuring obligations associated with the potenza  italy facility of million 
total cash costs for the plan  excluding the restructuring and environmental obligations assumed by the buyer of daramic srl  were million 

table of contents restructuring plan 
in december  our separations media segment exited the production of cellulosic membranes and realigned the cost structure at its wuppertal  germany facility 
the total cost of the plan was million  consisting of million for employee layoffs  million for other costs related to the shutdown of portions of the wuppertal  germany facility and a non cash impairment charge of million for buildings and equipment 
in  we reduced the cost of severance and benefits and related accrual by million to reflect actual costs incurred 
foreign operations at january   we manufacture our products at strategically located facilities in north america  europe and asia 
net sales from the foreign locations were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal typically  we sell our products in the currency of the country where the manufacturing facility that produces the product is located 
sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks  including the impact of foreign government regulations  currency fluctuations  political uncertainties and differences in business practices 
there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business or market opportunities within such governments countries 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the political  cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 
seasonality operations at our european production facilities are traditionally subject to shutdowns for approximately one month during the third quarter of each year for employee vacations 
as a result  operating income during the third quarter of fiscal was  and during the third quarter of any fiscal year in the future may be  lower than operating income in other quarters during the same fiscal year 
in view of the seasonal fluctuations  we believe that comparisons of our operating results for the third quarter of any fiscal year with those of the other quarters during the same fiscal year may be of limited relevance in predicting our future financial performance 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at january  from million at january   as we used cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities of million to support capacity expansion projects  make certain payments associated with the sale of our italian subsidiary and reduce and refinance our senior subordinated notes 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  consisting of cash flows from operations of million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
accounts receivable and inventory increased due to higher sales and production volumes associated with strong demand 
days sales outstanding is consistent with the prior year  and we have not experienced significant changes in accounts receivable aging or customer payment terms and believe that we have adequately provided for potential bad debts 
inventory is produced based on customer orders and forecasts 
inventory is generally not subject to obsolescence and does not have a shelf life  and we do not believe there is a significant risk of inventory impairment 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased due to timing of payments and higher accrued variable incentive compensation under performance based compensation plans 
investing activities 
capital expenditures increased in as we started significant capacity expansion projects in our energy storage and separations media business segments 
in energy storage  we have four lithium capacity expansion projects in progress  three of which are targeted at the edv market and one for consumer electronics 
the total cost of the lithium expansion projects is expected to be approximately million  of which million will be reimbursed under a grant from the 
table of contents doe 
in our separations media segment  we announced in the second quarter of a million expansion of hemodialysis membrane purema production capacity at our wuppertal  germany facility 
capital expenditures for these expansion projects are expected to be incurred beginning in through mid total capital expenditures  including normal maintenance activities  were million net of doe grant awards of million in fiscal based on approved and announced investments  we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately million net of the doe grant awards in fiscal as a result of the march  stock sale of our italian subsidiary  daramic srl  the buyer acquired the potenza  italy manufacturing facility and assumed all liabilities of the subsidiary  including environmental obligations and severance costs associated with closing this facility in as a result of the stock sale  we were required to make net cash payments to the buyer of million 
financing activities 
during fiscal  we used million of cash in financing activities 
the primary financing activity consisted of a million net use of cash from issuing new senior notes  purchasing the senior subordinated notes and paying related transaction expenses 
we also made principal payments of million on our term loans  including a million mandatory prepayment associated with the fiscal excess cash flow calculation as defined in our senior secured credit agreement 
we intend to fund our ongoing operations with cash on hand  cash generated by operations and borrowings available under the senior secured credit agreement 
our senior secured credit agreement provides for a us dollar term loan facility million outstanding at january   a euro term loan facility million outstanding at january  and a million revolving credit facility 
at january   we had million of borrowings available under the revolving credit facility  consisting of the million facility less undrawn standby letters of credit 
the term loans mature in july and the revolving credit facility matures in july interest rates under the senior secured credit agreement are  at our option  equal to either an alternate base rate or the eurocurrency base rate plus a specified margin 
at january   interest rates on the us dollar term loan and eurodollar term loan were and  respectively 
when loans are outstanding under the revolving credit facility  we are required to maintain a senior leverage ratio of indebtedness to adjusted ebitda of less than to 
at january   our senior leverage ratio was to and therefore  had no effect on borrowings available under the revolving credit facility 

table of contents adjusted ebitda  as defined under the senior secured credit agreement  was as follows in millions fiscal net income add subtract depreciation and amortization interest expense  net income taxes stock based compensation foreign currency gain loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment business restructuring gain on sale of italian subsidiary costs related to purchase of senior subordinated notes costs related to the ftc litigation other non cash or non recurring charges adjusted ebitda the calculation of the senior leverage ratio as defined under the senior secured credit agreement as of january  was as follows in millions fiscal indebtedness adjusted ebitda actual leverage ratio x calculated as the sum of outstanding borrowings under the senior secured credit agreement  less cash on hand not to exceed million 
the senior secured credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants which  among other things  limit capital spending  the incurrence of additional indebtedness  investments  dividends  transactions with affiliates  asset sales  acquisitions  mergers and consolidations  prepayments of other indebtedness  liens and encumbrances and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements 
the agreement also contains certain customary events of default  subject to grace periods  as appropriate 
we believe that annual capital expenditure limitations imposed by the senior credit agreement will not significantly inhibit us from meeting our ongoing capital expenditure needs 
the senior notes will mature on november  and are guaranteed by most of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions 
except under certain circumstances  the senior notes do not require principal payments prior to their maturity in interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually on may and november the senior notes contain customary covenants and events of default  including covenants that limit our ability to incur debt  pay dividends and make investments 
future principal debt service payments are expected to be paid out of cash flows from operations  borrowings on our revolving credit facility and future refinancing of our debt 
our cash interest requirements for the next twelve months are estimated to be million 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements over both the short next twelve months and long term in relation to our debt service requirements 
in evaluating the sufficiency of our liquidity  we considered cash on hand  expected cash flow to be generated from operations and available borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement compared to our 
table of contents anticipated cash requirements for debt service  working capital  cash taxes and capital expenditures and funding requirements for long term liabilities 
we anticipate that our cash on hand and operating cash flow  together with borrowings under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due for at least the next twelve months 
however  our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control 
see item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k 
from time to time  we may explore additional financing methods and other means to lower our cost of capital  which could include equity or debt financings and the application of the proceeds therefrom to the repayment of bank debt or other indebtedness 
in addition  in connection with any future acquisitions  we may require additional funding which may be provided in the form of an additional equity or debt financing or a combination thereof 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
environmental matters environmental obligations are accrued when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
the amount of liability recorded is based on currently available information  including the progress of remedial investigations  current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the method and extent of remediation  presently enacted laws and existing technology 
accruals for estimated losses from environmental obligations are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
costs of future expenditures for environmental obligations are not discounted to their present value 
we do not currently anticipate any material loss in excess of the amounts accrued 
future remediation expenses may be affected by a number of uncertainties including  but not limited to  the difficulty in estimating the extent and method of remediation  the evolving nature of environmental regulations and the availability and application of technology 
we do not expect the resolution of such uncertainties to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity 
recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recognized as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
at january   environmental reserves  which are predominately euro denominated  were million 
on march   we sold of the stock of our italian subsidiary  daramic srl as a result of the stock sale  the buyer acquired all assets and liabilities of daramic srl  including the potenza  italy facility and environmental obligations of million associated with the potenza site 
the buyer has fully indemnified us with regard to environmental  health and safety matters related to this site 
in connection with the acquisition of membrana in  we recorded a reserve for environmental obligations 
the reserve provides for costs to remediate known environmental issues and operational upgrades which are required in order for us to remain in compliance with local regulations 
the initial estimate and subsequent finalization of the reserve was included in the allocation of purchase price at the date of acquisition 
at january   the environmental reserve for the membrana facility was million 
we anticipate that expenditures will be made over the next three to five years 
we have indemnification agreements for certain environmental matters from acordis and akzo  the prior owners of membrana 
akzo originally provided broad environmental protections to acordis with the right to assign such indemnities to acordis successors 
akzo indemnifications relate to conditions existing prior to december  which is the date that membrana was sold to acordis 
in addition to the akzo indemnification  acordis provides separate indemnification of claims incurred from december through february  the acquisition date 
we will receive indemnification

as discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data  we have long term liabilities for pension and postretirement benefits of million as of january  our contributions for these benefit plans are not included in the table above since the timing and amount of payments are dependent upon many factors  including when an employee retires or leaves the company  certain benefit elections by employees  return on plan assets  minimum funding requirements and foreign currency exchange rates 
we estimate that contributions to the pension and postretirement plans in fiscal will be million 
as discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data  we have net environmental obligations of million  consisting of environmental obligations of million less related indemnification receivables of million 
payments related to these obligations are made and then submitted against approved indemnification claims 
these amounts are not included in the table above since the timing of payments and receipts is not certain 
in  we received net cash receipts of million and in  we estimate net cash payments will be million 
we expect that net payments of million will occur over the next three to five years 

table of contents as discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data  we have recorded a liability at january  of million for uncertain tax positions 
payments related to this liability are not included in the table above since the timing and actual amounts of the payments  if any  are not known 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  which are potential losses arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign exchange fluctuations 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk at january   we had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million 
to reduce the interest rate risk inherent in our variable rate debt  we may utilize interest rate swap agreements to convert all or a portion of the variable rate debt to a fixed rate obligation 
as of january   there were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
the pre tax earnings and cash flow impact resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt  holding other variables constant  would be million per year 
currency risk outside of the united states  we maintain assets and operations in europe and asia 
the results of operations and financial position of our foreign operations are principally measured in their respective currency and translated into us dollars 
as a result  exposure to foreign currency gains and losses exists 
the reported income of these subsidiaries will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
our subsidiaries and affiliates also purchase and sell products and services in various currencies 
as a result  we may be exposed to cost increases relative to the local currencies in the markets in which we sell 
because the percentage of our sales in foreign currencies differs from the percentage of our costs in foreign currencies  a change in the relative value of the us dollar could have a disproportionate impact on our sales compared to our costs  which could impact our margins 
a portion of our assets are based in our foreign locations and are translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each period  with the effect of such translation reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
accordingly  our consolidated shareholders equity will fluctuate depending upon the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency  primarily the euro 
the dollar euro exchange rates used in our financial statements for the fiscal years ended as set forth below were as follows period end rate period average rate our strategy for management of currency risk relies primarily on conducting our operations in a country respective currency and may  from time to time  involve foreign currency derivatives 
as of january   we did not have any foreign currency derivatives outstanding
