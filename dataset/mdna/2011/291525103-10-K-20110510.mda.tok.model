item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
general the following discussion pertains to emmis communications corporation ecc and its subsidiaries collectively  emmis or the company 
we own and operate radio and publishing properties located primarily in the united states 
our revenues are mostly affected by the advertising rates our entities charge  as advertising sales represent more than of our consolidated revenues 
these rates are in large part based on our entities ability to attract audiences subscribers in demographic groups targeted by their advertisers 
arbitron inc generally measures radio station ratings weekly for markets measured by the portable people meter tm and four times a year for markets measured by diaries 
because audience ratings in a station s local market are critical to the station s financial success  our strategy is to use market research  advertising and promotion to attract and retain audiences in each station s chosen demographic target group 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the broadcasting industry  our revenues and operating income are usually lowest in our fourth fiscal quarter 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  stations typically exchange advertising time for goods or services  which can be used by the station in its business operations 
these barter transactions are recorded at the estimated fair value of the product or service received 
we generally confine the use of such trade transactions to promotional items or services for which we would otherwise have paid cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to preempt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade 

table of contents the following table summarizes the sources of our revenues for the past three years 
all revenues generated by our international radio properties are included in the local category 
the category non traditional principally consists of ticket sales and sponsorships of events our stations and magazines conduct in their local markets 
the category other includes  among other items  revenues generated by the websites of our entities  and barter 
year ended february  of total of total of total net revenues local national political publication sales non traditional other total net revenues a significant portion of our expenses varies in connection with changes in revenue 
these variable expenses primarily relate to costs in our sales department  such as salaries  commissions and bad debt 
our costs that do not vary as much in relation to revenue are mostly in our programming and general and administrative departments  such as talent costs  syndicated programming fees  utilities  office expenses and salaries 
lastly  our costs that are highly discretionary are costs in our marketing and promotions department  which we primarily incur to maintain and or increase our audience and market share 
known trends and uncertainties although advertising revenues are on an upswing following the recent global recession  domestic radio revenue growth has been challenged for several years 
management believes this is principally the result of three factors the proliferation of advertising inventory caused by the emergence of new media  such as various media distributed via the internet  telecommunication companies and cable interconnects  as well as social networks and social coupon sites  all of which are gaining advertising share against radio and other traditional media  the perception of investors and advertisers that satellite radio and portable media players diminish the effectiveness of radio advertising  and the adoption of a new method of gathering ratings data  which has shown an increase in cumulative audience size  but a decrease in time spent listening as compared to the previous method of gathering ratings data 
the company and the radio industry have begun several initiatives to address these issues 
the radio industry is working aggressively to increase the number of portable digital media devices that contain an fm tuner  including smartphones and music players 
in many countries  fm tuners are common features in portable digital media devices 
the radio industry is working with leading united states network providers  device manufacturers  regulators and legislators to ensure that fm tuners are included in future portable digital media devices 
including fm as a feature on these devices has the potential to increase radio listening and improve perception of the radio industry while offering network providers the benefits of a proven emergency notification system  reduced network congestion from audio streaming services  and a host of new revenue generating applications 
the company has also aggressively worked to harness the power of broadband and mobile media distribution in the development of emerging business opportunities by becoming one of the fifteen largest streaming audio providers in the united states  developing highly interactive websites with content that engages our listeners  using sms texting and delivering real time traffic to navigation devices 
along with the rest of the radio industry  the majority of our stations have deployed hd radio 
hd radio offers listeners advantages over standard analog broadcasts  including improved sound quality and additional digital channels 
to make the rollout of hd radio more efficient  a consortium of broadcasters representing a majority of the radio stations in nearly all of our markets have agreed to work together in each radio market to ensure the most diverse consumer offering possible and to accelerate the rollout of hd radio receivers  particularly in automobiles 
in addition to offering secondary channels  the hd radio spectrum allows broadcasters to transmit other forms of data 
we are participating in a joint venture with other broadcasters to provide the bandwidth that a third party will use to transmit location based data to hand held and in car navigation devices 
it is unclear what impact hd radio will have on the markets in which we operate 

table of contents arbitron inc  the supplier of ratings data for united states radio markets  has developed technology to passively collect data for its ratings service 
the portable people meter tm ppm tm is a small  pager sized device that does not require any active manipulation by the end user and is capable of automatically measuring radio  television  internet  satellite radio and satellite television signals that are encoded for the service by the broadcaster 
the ppm tm offers a number of advantages over the traditional diary ratings collection system including ease of use  more reliable ratings data and shorter time periods between when advertising runs and when audience listening or viewing habits can be reported 
this service began in the new york  los angeles and chicago markets in october  in the st 
louis market in october  and the austin and indianapolis markets in the fall of in each market in which the service has launched  there has been a compression in the relative ratings of all stations in the market  increasing the competitive pressure within the market for advertising dollars 
in addition  ratings for certain stations when measured by the ppm tm as opposed to the traditional diary methodology can be materially different 
the company continues to evaluate the impact ppm tm will have on our revenues in these markets 
as discussed below  our radio stations in los angeles and chicago have trailed the performance of their respective markets 
management believes this relative underperformance is principally due our lack of scale in these markets 
we are overly dependent on the performance of one or two stations in these markets  and as the competitive environment shifts  our ability to adapt is limited 
furthermore  some of our competitors operate larger station clusters in los angeles and chicago than we do  enabling them to use their market share to extract a greater percentage of available advertising revenue through discounting unit rates 
on april   emmis entered into an lma and a put and call agreement for kmvn fm in los angeles with a subsidiary of grupo radio centro  sab de c 
v grc  a mexican broadcasting company 
the lma for kmvn fm commenced on april  and will continue for up to seven years 
the lma requires million in annual payments plus reimbursement of certain expenses 
grc paid the first two years of lma payments in advance at closing 
at any time during the lma  grc has the right to purchase the station for million 
at the end of the term  emmis has the right to require grc to purchase the station for the same amount 
under the lma  emmis continues to own and operate the station  with grc providing emmis with broadcast programming 
in connection with the lma  the call letters of the station changed from kmvn fm to kxos fm 
the performance of emmis other los angeles radio station  kpwr fm  trailed the performance of the overall market 
for the twelve month period ended february   kpwr fm s gross revenues were down whereas the independent accounting firm miller  kaplan  arase co 
miller kaplan reported that the los angeles market total gross revenues were up versus the same period of the prior year 
our radio cluster in chicago trailed the performance of the overall chicago radio market during the twelve month period ended february  for the twelve month period ended february   our chicago radio stations gross revenues were down  whereas miller kaplan reported that chicago radio market total gross revenues were up versus the same period of the prior year 
while our performance in los angeles and chicago during the twelve month period ended february  was disappointing  all of our remaining markets for which miller kaplan data is available new york  st 
louis  indianapolis and austin outperformed their respective markets 
as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of radio stations  publishing properties and other businesses that we believe hold promise for long term appreciation in value and leverage our strengths 
however  emmis operating company s the company s principal operating subsidiary  hereinafter eoc credit agreement substantially limits our ability to make acquisitions 
we also regularly review our portfolio of assets and may opportunistically dispose of assets when we believe it is appropriate to do so 
in particular  we have one radio station in new york city and two radio stations in chicago where we believe the sale value could exceed the prospects for cash flow generation as part of our portfolio 
although we remain optimistic about the growth potential of these stations  we are exploring the sale of one or more of these stations to reduce our indebtedness 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that encompass significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially derive materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those described below 
revenue recognition broadcasting revenue is recognized as advertisements are aired 
publication revenue is recognized in the month of delivery of the publication 
both broadcasting revenue and publication revenue recognition is subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time the advertisement is aired for broadcasting revenue and upon delivery of the publication for publication revenue 
advertising revenues presented in the financial statements are reflected on a net basis  after the deduction of advertising agency fees  usually at a rate of of gross revenues 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded based on management s judgment of the collectability of receivables 
when assessing the collectability of receivables  management considers  among other things  historical loss experience and existing economic conditions 
fcc licenses and goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to fcc licenses and goodwill assets 
as of february   we have recorded approximately million in goodwill and fcc licenses  which represents approximately of our total assets 
in the case of our us radio stations  we would not be able to operate the properties without the related fcc license for each property 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor our stations compliance with the various regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our fcc licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective periods  and we expect that all fcc licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
we consider our fcc licenses to be indefinite lived intangibles 
our foreign broadcasting licenses expire during periods ranging from december to february we will need to submit applications to extend our foreign licenses upon their expiration to continue our broadcast operations in these countries 
while there is a general expectancy of renewal of radio broadcast licenses in most countries and we expect to actively seek renewal of our foreign licenses  most of the countries in which we operate do not have the regulatory framework or history that we have with respect to license renewals in the united states 
this makes the risk of non renewal or of renewal on less favorable terms of foreign licenses greater than for united states licenses  as was demonstrated in hungary when our broadcasting license was not renewed in november under circumstances that even a hungarian court ruled violated hungarian law and various bilateral investment treaties 
we treat our foreign broadcasting licenses as definite lived intangibles and amortize them over their respective license periods 
we do not amortize goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets  but rather test for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
when evaluating our radio broadcasting licenses for impairment  the testing is performed at the unit of accounting level as determined by accounting standards codification asc topic in our case  radio stations in a geographic market cluster are considered a single unit of accounting  provided that they are not being operated under a local marketing agreement by another broadcaster 
we complete our annual impairment tests on december of each year and perform additional interim impairment testing whenever triggering events suggest such testing is warranted 
valuation of indefinite lived broadcasting licenses fair value of our fcc licenses is estimated to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
to determine the fair value of our fcc licenses  the company uses an income valuation method when it performs its impairment tests 
under this method  the company projects cash flows that would be generated by each of its units of accounting assuming the unit of accounting was commencing operations in its respective market at the beginning of the valuation period 
this cash flow stream is discounted to arrive at a value for the fcc license 
the company assumes the competitive situation that exists in each market remains unchanged  with the exception that its unit of accounting commenced operations at the beginning of the valuation period 
in doing so  the company extracts the value of going concern and any other assets acquired  and strictly values the fcc license 
major assumptions involved in this analysis include market revenue  market revenue growth rates  unit of accounting audience share  unit of accounting revenue share and discount rate 
each of these assumptions may change in the future based upon changes in general economic conditions  audience behavior  consummated transactions  and numerous other variables that may be beyond our control 

table of contents the projections incorporated into our annual license valuations take into consideration the recent economic recession and credit crisis  which has led to a further weakened and less profitable radio marketplace with a higher cost of capital 
between its october  interim impairment assessment and its december  annual assessment  the company incorporated several more conservative estimates into its assumptions to reflect the deterioration in both the us economy and the radio marketplace as well as the repricing of risk 
specifically  discount rates increased from to in the october  assessment to a range of to in the december  assessment 
also  operating profit margins decreased from a range of to in the october  assessment to a range of to in the december  assessment 
assumptions incorporated into the annual impairment testing as of december  were similar to those used in our december  annual impairment testing  although revenue growth rates were slightly higher as a result of the pace of the industry s recent revenue recovery  which also helped to lower the discount rates 
we expect the ongoing recovery in radio revenues to continue throughout our fiscal below are some of the key assumptions used in our annual and interim impairment assessments 
the methodology used to value our fcc licenses has not changed in the three year period ended february  october  december  august  december  december  discount rate long term revenue growth rate years revenue growth rate all years mature market share operating profit margin valuation of goodwill asc topic requires the company to test goodwill for impairment at least annually using a two step process 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of impairment 
the company conducts the two step impairment test on december of each fiscal year  unless indications of impairment exist during an interim period 
when assessing its goodwill for impairment  the company uses an enterprise valuation approach to determine the fair value of each of the company s reporting units radio stations grouped by market and magazines on an individual basis 
management determines enterprise value for each of its reporting units by multiplying the two year average station operating income generated by each reporting unit current year based on actual results and the next year based on budgeted results by an estimated market multiple 
the company uses a blended station operating income trading multiple of publicly traded radio operators as a benchmark for the multiple it applies to its radio reporting units 
there are no publicly traded publishing companies that are focused predominantly on city and regional magazines as is our publishing segment 
therefore  the market multiple used as a benchmark for our publishing reporting units is based on recently completed transactions within the city and regional magazine industry or analyst reports that include valuations of magazine divisions within publicly traded media conglomerates 
for the annual assessment performed as of december   the company applied a market multiple of times and times the reporting unit s operating performance for our radio and publishing reporting units  respectively 
management believes this methodology for valuing radio and publishing properties is a common approach and believes that the multiples used in the valuation are reasonable given our peer comparisons and recent market transactions 
to corroborate the step one reporting unit fair values determined using the market approach described above  management also uses an income approach  which is a discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of the reporting unit 
this enterprise valuation is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit for the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
if the reporting unit exhibits impairment  the company proceeds to the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
for its step two testing  the enterprise value is allocated among the tangible assets  indefinite lived intangible assets fcc licenses valued using a direct method valuation approach and unrecognized intangible assets  such as customer lists  with the residual amount representing the implied fair value of the goodwill 
to the extent the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the difference is recorded as an impairment charge in the statement of operations 
the methodology used to value our goodwill has not changed in the three year period ended february  
table of contents sensitivity analysis based on the results of our december  annual impairment assessment  the fair value of our broadcasting licenses was approximately million which was in excess of the million carrying value by million  or 
the fair values exceeded the carrying values of all of our units of accounting except our austin radio cluster  where we recorded an impairment charge of million 
should our estimates or assumptions worsen  or should negative events or circumstances occur in the units that have limited fair value cushion  additional license impairments may be needed 
radio broadcasting licenses as of february  december  percentage by which fair unit of accounting carrying value fair value value exceeds carrying value new york cluster kxos fm los angeles chicago cluster austin cluster st 
louis cluster indianapolis cluster kpwr fm los angeles terre haute cluster total our annual impairment testing on december  resulted in an impairment charge of million 
if we were to assume a change in any of our three key assumptions a reduction in the long term revenue growth rate  a reduction in local commercial share or an increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of our broadcasting licenses on december   the resulting impairment charge would have been an incremental million  million and million  respectively 
also  if we were to assume a market multiple decrease of one or a decrease in the two year average station operating income  two of the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our goodwill on december   the resulting estimates of enterprise valuations would still exceed the carrying values of the enterprises 
as such  step two of the goodwill impairment testing would not be required 
thus no impairment would be recognized if these two key assumptions were lowered 
the sharp economic downturn in late and throughout calendar negatively impacted the radio broadcasting industry as advertising revenues declined and expectations for near term growth declined throughout most of calendar the projected revenue growth levels for the industry when we completed our interim impairment testing on august  were lower than we had originally forecasted when we completed our fiscal annual impairment test on december  this decline caused us to record further impairment to broadcasting licenses and goodwill as part of our august  impairment review 
as revenues decline  profitability levels are also negatively impacted as fixed costs represent a significant component of a radio station s operating expenses 
as a result  the fair value of our asset base is particularly sensitive to the impact of declining revenues 
deferred taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequence of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or income tax returns 
income taxes are recognized during the year in which the underlying transactions are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
deferred taxes are provided for temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities as recorded for financial reporting purposes and amounts recorded for income tax purposes 
after determining the total amount of deferred tax assets  the company determines whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if the company determines that a deferred tax asset is not likely to be realized  a valuation allowance will be established against that asset to record it at its expected realizable value 
insurance claims and loss reserves the company is self insured for most healthcare claims  subject to stop loss limits 
claims incurred but not reported are recorded based on historical experience and industry trends  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances 
the company had million and million accrued for employee healthcare claims as of february  and  respectively 
the company also maintains large deductible programs ranging from thousand to thousand per occurrence for workers compensation  employment liability  automotive liability and media liability claims 

table of contents acquisitions  dispositions and investments the transactions described below impact the comparability of operating results for the three years ended february  during the quarter ended may   emmis completed a series of transactions with its noncontrolling partners of two of our bulgarian radio networks that gave emmis ownership in those networks 
the purchase price of these transactions totaled million in cash  and a substantial portion was allocated to goodwill which was then determined to be substantially impaired 
emmis recorded an impairment loss of million related to bulgarian goodwill during the quarter ended may  on may   emmis sold the stock of its belgium radio operation to alfacam group nv  a belgian corporation  for euros 
emmis recognized a gain on the sale of its belgium radio operations of million  which included a gain of million related to the transfer of cumulative translation adjustments 
the gain on sale of the belgium radio operations is included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
emmis desired to exit belgium as its financial performance in the market failed to meet expectations 
the sale allowed emmis to eliminate further operating losses 
on july   emmis completed the sale of its sole remaining television station  wvue tv in new orleans  la  to louisiana media company llc for million in cash 
the company recognized a loss on the sale of wvue tv of million  net of tax benefits of million  which is included in income from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in connection with the sale  the company paid discretionary bonuses to the employees of wvue tv totaling million  which is included in the calculation of the loss on sale 
the sale of wvue tv completes the sale of our television division which began on may   when emmis announced that it had engaged advisors to assist in evaluating strategic alternatives for its television assets 
results of operations year ended february  compared to year ended february  net revenues for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands net revenues radio publishing total net revenues radio net revenues increased principally as a result of general economic growth in our domestic radio markets as the economy recovers from the recent recession 
we typically monitor the performance of our domestic radio stations against the aggregate performance of the markets in which we operate based on reports for the periods prepared by the independent accounting firm miller kaplan 
miller kaplan reports are generally prepared on a gross revenue basis and exclude revenues from barter arrangements 
for the year ended february   revenues of our domestic radio stations were up  whereas miller kaplan reported that revenues of our domestic radio markets were up 
we significantly outperformed in our middle markets st 
louis  indianapolis and austin  which offset weakness at our los angeles and chicago radio stations 
the recovery in radio advertising has put greater demand on our advertising inventory 
in fiscal  our average minute rate was up and our number of minutes sold was up 
our international radio properties did not see the same level of recovery as our domestic radio properties and net revenues were down for the fiscal year 
publishing net revenues also increased principally due to the better economic climate  though the recovery in advertising for our publishing division has been slower to develop than what we have seen in our radio division

for the year ended february   revenues of our domestic radio stations were down  whereas miller kaplan reported that revenues of our domestic radio markets were down 
the relative underperformance of our domestic radio stations is principally due to our lack of scale in the new york and los angeles markets and the introduction of ppm tm to those markets in october market weakness and our stations weakness have led us to discount our rates charged to advertisers 
in fiscal  our average unit rate was down and our number of units sold was up 
the company s national representation firm guaranteed a minimum amount of national sales for the years ended february  and february  actual national sales  as defined by the representation agreement  were approximately million lower than the guaranteed minimum amount of national sales in fiscal and the national representation firm has paid the shortfall to emmis

our ability to access our share of these international cash balances net of noncontrolling interests is limited by country specific statutory requirements

since we manage cash on a consolidated basis  any cash needs of a particular segment or operating entity are met by intercompany transactions

table of contents operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities were million and million for the years ended february  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was mainly attributable to changes in working capital 
the decrease in cash provided by working capital was largely driven by the receipt of million related to our national representation firm s performance guarantee and the collection of million for the first two years of lma fees for kxos fm  both of which occurred in the year ended february  these fiscal receipts are partially offset by the receipt of million related to the previously discussed federal tax refund during the year ended february  cash flows provided by operating activities were million and million for the years ended february  and  respectively

we exercised our early buyout option on the jet and immediately began marketing it for sale 
we closed on the sale of the corporate jet on april  and received million in cash 
we recognized a million impairment loss on the corporate jet in fiscal as its carrying value  which included million of previously capitalized major maintenance costs  exceeded its fair value as of february  we expect that future requirements for capital expenditures will include capital expenditures incurred during the ordinary course of business 
we expect to fund such capital expenditures with cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our credit agreement

we had entered into two separate interest rate exchange agreements that effectively fixed the rate we paid on a portion of the debt outstanding under our credit agreement

the terms of emmis preferred stock provide for a quarterly dividend payment of 
per share on each january  april  july and october emmis has not declared a preferred stock dividend since october  as of february   cumulative preferred dividends in arrears total million 
failure to pay the dividend is not a default under the terms of the preferred stock 
however  since dividends have remain unpaid for more than six quarters  the holders of the preferred stock are entitled to elect two persons to our board of directors 
the company has received nominations for these director positions for the annual meeting of shareholders expected to be held in july the second amendment and third amendment to our credit agreement prohibit the company from paying dividends on the preferred stock during the suspension period as defined in the credit agreement see liquidity and capital resources 
subject to the restrictions of the credit agreement  payment of future preferred stock dividends is at the discretion of the company s board of directors 
at april   we had million available for additional borrowing under our credit facility  which is net of million in outstanding letters of credit 
availability under the credit facility depends upon our continued compliance with certain operating covenants and financial ratios 
emmis was in compliance with these covenants as of february  as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of radio stations  publishing properties and other businesses that we believe hold promise for long term appreciation in value and leverage our strengths 
however  emmis operating company s credit agreement  as amended  substantially limits our ability to make acquisitions 
we also regularly review our portfolio of assets and may opportunistically dispose of assets when we believe it is appropriate to do so 
in particular  we have one radio station in new york city and two radio stations in chicago where we believe the sale value could exceed the prospects for cash flow generation as part of our portfolio 
although we remain optimistic about the growth potential of these stations  we are exploring the sale of one or more of these stations to reduce our indebtedness 
intangibles as of february   approximately of our total assets consisted of intangible assets  such as fcc broadcast licenses  goodwill  subscription lists and similar assets  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our businesses 
in the case of our domestic radio stations  we would not be able to operate the properties without the related fcc license for each property 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations for compliance with regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our fcc licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all of our fcc licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
our various foreign broadcasting licenses in slovakia and bulgaria expire in january and february we will need to submit applications to seek to extend our foreign licenses upon their expiration to continue our broadcast operations in these countries 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no 
 improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
these amended standards eliminate a mandatory quantitative approach to determine whether a variable interest provides the entity with a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity in favor of a qualitatively focused analysis  and require an ongoing reassessment of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary 
these amended standards were effective march  the adoption of these standards did not have any effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
seasonality our results of operations are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations  which result in higher second and third quarter revenues and operating income 
for our radio operations  this seasonality is due to the younger demographic composition of many of our stations 
advertisers increase spending during the summer months to target these listeners 
in addition  advertisers generally increase spending across all segments during the months of october and november  which are part of our third quarter  in anticipation of the holiday season 
inflation the impact of inflation on operations has not been significant to date 
however  there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on operating results  particularly since a significant portion of our senior bank debt is comprised of variable rate debt 
off balance sheet financings and liabilities other than interest rate swap agreements  which are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  and lease commitments  legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of business  contractual commitments to purchase goods and services and employment contracts for key employees  all of which are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company does not have any material off balance sheet financings or liabilities
