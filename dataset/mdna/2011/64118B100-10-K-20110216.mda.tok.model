item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading fabless semiconductor company that designs  develops and sells proprietary high performance processors and high speed integrated circuits that are used to enhance the performance  functionality and energy efficiency of advanced mobile wireless infrastructure  data center  enterprise  metro ethernet  edge and core infrastructure networks 
our market leading product portfolio includes high performance multi core communications processors  knowledge based processors  high speed gigabit ethernet physical layer devices  network search engines  and ultra low power embedded processors 
these products are designed into high performance systems such as switches  routers  wireless base stations  access aggregation  radio network controllers  security appliances  networked storage appliances  service gateways and connected media devices offered by leading original equipment manufacturers oems such as alcatel lucent  brocade communications systems  cisco systems  dell inc  ericsson  finisar corporation  hewlett packard  huawei technologies co 
ltd  juniper networks  inc  mcafee  inc  motorola  inc  nokia siemens networks  tellabs  inc  and zte corporation 
the products and technologies we have developed and acquired are targeted to enable our customers to develop systems that support the increasing speeds and complexity of internet protocol ip networks 
we believe there is a growing need to include high performance multi core processors  knowledge based processors and high speed physical layer devices in a larger number of ip equipment as networks transition to all internet protocol packet processing at increasing speeds and complexity 
the equipment and systems that use our products are technically complex 
as a result  the time from our initial customer engagement design activity to volume production can be lengthy and may require considerable support from our design engineering  research and development  sales  and marketing personnel in order to secure the engagement and commence product sales to the customer 
once the customer s equipment is in volume production  however  it generally has a life cycle of three to five years and requires less ongoing support 
we derive revenue primarily from sales of semiconductor products to oem and their contract manufacturers  and to our distributors and international sales representatives 
usually  we initially sell product for a new design directly to oem customers 
once their design enters production  the oem customers frequently outsource their manufacturing to contract manufacturers that purchase our products directly from us or from our distributors and international sales representatives 
we maintain inventory  or hubbing  arrangements with some of these customers  including our largest customer  cisco and its supplier  wintec industries 
pursuant to these arrangements  we deliver products to a customer  an intermediary or a designated third party warehouse based upon the customer s projected needs  but do not recognize product revenue unless and until the customer  intermediary or third party warehouse reports it has removed  or pulled  our product from the warehouse to be incorporated into the customers end products 
we also use distributors to provide valuable assistance to end users in delivery of our products and related services 
our distributors are used to support our international sales logistic principally in asia 
in accordance with standard market practice  our distributor agreements generally limit the distributor s ability to return product up to a portion of purchases in the preceding quarter and limit price protection for inventory on hand if it subsequently lowers prices on our products 
we recognize revenue from sales through distributors at the time of shipment to end customers reported by our distributors 
as a fabless semiconductor company  our business is less capital intensive than others because we rely on third parties to manufacture  assemble  and test our products 
in general  we do not anticipate making significant capital expenditures aside from business acquisitions that we might make from time to time 
in the future  as we launch new products or expand our operations  however  we may require additional funds to procure product mask sets  order elevated quantities of wafers from our foundry partners  perform qualification testing and assemble and test those products 
because we purchase all wafers from suppliers with fabrication facilities and outsource the assembly and testing to third party vendors  a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments to third party vendors 

table of contents recent acquisitions on october   we completed our acquisition of rmi corporation rmi  a provider of high performance and low power communication  multi threaded processors and delivered merger consideration of approximately million shares of the our common stock valued at million and million cash to the paying agent for distribution to the former holders of rmi capital stock 
additionally  in december we issued approximately million shares of our common stock and paid million cash to the former holders of rmi capital stock as earn out consideration based upon achievement of of revenue targets for the month period from november  through october  on july   we completed the idt nse acquisition 
the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination during the third quarter of as purchase consideration we paid million in cash  net of a price adjustment based on a determination of the actual amount of inventory received 
on october   we completed the acquisition of aeluros  inc which was accounted for as a business combination during the fourth quarter of we paid million in cash upon the closing of the transaction 
under the terms of the definitive agreement  we paid additional million cash in february based on the attainment of revenue performance milestones for the acquired business during the one year period following the close of the transaction 
our results of operations for the year ended december  and did not include revenues and costs associated with the rmi and idt nse acquisitions prior to their respective acquisition dates of october  and july  whereas the results of operations in reflect revenues and costs attributable to the combined company and consequently are substantially higher than the results in and outlook and challenges our year over year net revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a result of our rmi and idt acquisitions  and also due the improved demand of all of our products due to the continued growth for demand of products that enable the build out of the wireless internet infrastructure 
in order to support our growing business operations we increased our worldwide hiring by adding new employees and improving our processes and systems related to our management information and enterprise resource planning systems to keep in pace with our breadth and scale of business while maintaining regulatory compliance 
our integration of the idt nse business and rmi included the continued assimilation of employees  retention of key personnel and existing customers  and acquitision of new customers 
our product revenue is concentrated among a small number of large customers 
for the year ended december   our top five customers in terms of revenue accounted for approximately of total product revenue 
although we believe our revenues will continue to be concentrated among our largest customers  because of concentration in the networking equipment business  we expect that continued favorable market trends  such as the increasing number of gigabit ports as enterprises and datacenters upgrade their legacy networks to better accommodate the proliferation of video and virtualization applications  and the growing mobile wireless infrastructure and iptv markets  will enable us to broaden our customer base 
additionally  our expanding product portfolio will also help us further diversify our customer and product revenues as well as expand our offerings to our existing customers 
for  of our product revenue was realized through inventory  or hubbing  arrangements with certain customers  including our largest customer  cisco and its supplier  wintec industries 
we expect more of our larger customers to adopt these hubbing arrangements in the future 
pursuant to these arrangements  we deliver products to a customer  an intermediary or a designated third party warehouse based upon the customer s projected needs  but do not recognize product revenue unless and until the customer  intermediary or third party warehouse reports it has removed  or pulled  our product from the warehouse to be incorporated into the customers end products 
historically  we have had reasonable visibility of our customers requirements within a quarter  and typically commit resources and incur expense based on our projections 
however  if a customer that uses a hubbing arrangement does not take delivery of products in accordance with the schedule it originally provided to us  our predicted future revenue stream could vary substantially from our forecasts  and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  although we own the inventory physically located at these hubs  our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be restricted  causing our total inventory levels to increase 
this  in turn  could increase our expenses associated with excess and obsolete product and negatively impact our cash flows 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make fair and reasonable estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities and operating expenses during the period reported 
the following accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period they are determined to be necessary 
if actual results differ significantly from management estimates  our financial statements could be materially impacted 
our estimates are guided by observing the following critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from sales of semiconductor products 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria have been met i persuasive evidence of a binding arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and iv collection is probable 
the price is considered fixed or determinable at the execution of an agreement  based on specific products and quantities to be delivered at specified prices  which is often memorialized with a customer purchase order 
we assess the ability to collect from our customers based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness and any past transaction history of the customer 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of revenue 
revenue consists primarily of sales of our products to oem customers and their contract manufacturers  and to our distributors and international sales representatives 
initial sales of our products for a new design are usually made directly to oem customers as they design and develop their product 
once their design enters production  they often outsource their manufacturing to contract manufacturers that purchase our products directly from us or from our distributors and international sales representatives 
we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment to oem customers and their contract manufacturers and our international sales representatives 
product revenue and costs relating to sales made through distributors with rights of return and price credits are deferred until the distributors sell the product to end customers because the selling price is not fixed and determinable and we are not able to estimate future returns 
revenue recognition depends on notification from the distributor that product has been sold to an end customers 
on each reporting date we record a reduction in accounts receivable and deferred revenue based on our estimate of the margin to be ultimately recognized upon sale of the product to end customers 
we deliver and maintain inventory  or hubbing arrangements with certain customers  including our largest customer  cisco and its supplier  wintec industries  as described above 
we generally recognize revenue when the customer  intermediary or third party warehouse reports it has removed  or pulled  our product from the warehouse to be incorporated into the customers end products 
we have also entered into licensing agreements with some of our customers 
for these license arrangements we recognize revenue under the proportionate performance method provided that fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
when such license arrangements contain multiple elements eg  license grants and services  we review each element to determine the separate units of accounting that exist within the agreement 
if more than one unit of accounting exists  we generally allocate consideration payable to us under the agreement to each unit of accounting using the relative fair value method 
we recognize revenue for each unit of accounting when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for that unit of accounting 
inventory valuation and adverse purchase commitments 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we record inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
these estimates are generally based on a month forecast prepared by management 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those expected by management  additional adjustment to inventory valuation may be required 
the carrying value of inventory and the determination of possible adverse purchase commitments are dependent on our estimate of the yield that will be achieved  or the percent of good products identified when the product is tested 
warranty accrual 
we provide a limited warranty on our products for a period ranging from one to five years from the date of sale 
we accrue for the estimated future costs of repair or replacement when revenue is recognized for products sold 
the warranty accrual is estimated based on historical claims compared to actual revenue 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
in order to determine the collectability of our accounts receivable  we continually assess factors such as previous customer transactions and the credit worthiness of the customer 
to date  our accounts receivable write offs have been immaterial 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to make required payments 
in general  we establish allowances for accounts aged over days from the invoice date  unless specific circumstances indicate that the balance is collectible 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of timing differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized 
we also recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process prescribed in accounting standards code asc  income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on many factors  including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
we diversify our deposits with high credit quality financial institutions 
deposits held in money market funds are stated at cost  which approximates market value 
money market deposits are readily convertible to cash and are classified as cash equivalents 
marketable securities held by us  which are all available for sale investments and carried at fair value  consist of us government agency securities and us treasury securities 
the cost of securities sold is accounted for based on the specific identification method 
marketable securities with remaining contractual maturities on the date of purchase greater than days are classified as short term even though the contractual maturities may be greater than one year because such investments  which are highly liquid  represent funds available for use in current operations 
these investments are monitored for impairment periodically and reductions in carrying value are recorded against earnings when the declines are determined to be other than temporary 
long term investments 
from time to time we make debt and equity investments in non publicly traded companies where we are not the primary beneficiary 
these investments are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
debt investments are available for sale investments and are carried at fair value 
equity investments are accounted for under the cost method as we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the respective investee s operating and financial policies 
we monitor our available for sale debt investments and cost method equity investments in non publicly traded companies for impairment on a quarterly basis and record appropriate reductions in carrying values against earnings when such impairments are determined to be other than temporary 
factors considered in determining an impairment include  but are not limited to  the current business environment including competition and uncertainty of financial condition  going concern considerations such as the rate at which the investee company utilizes cash and the investee company s ability to obtain additional private financing to fulfill its stated business plan  the need for changes to the investee company s existing business model due to changing business environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes  and comparable valuations 
if an investment is determined to be impaired  a further assessment is made as to whether such impairment is other than temporary 
long lived assets and intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we estimate the future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset from its use or eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows  which includes revenue  is less than the carrying amount of those assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
goodwill 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least on an annual basis or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flow 
we perform goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired 
we perform our goodwill impairment assessment at the company level  which is our sole reporting unit 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter and concluded there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended december   and stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan awards using the black scholes merton valuation model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option expected life  the price volatility of the underlying stock  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
when establishing the expected life assumption  we review on a semi annual basis the historical employee exercise behavior with respect to grants and awards with similar vesting periods 
the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using a combination of the historical and implied volatility of the company common stock 
changes in the subjective assumptions required in the valuation models may significantly affect the estimated value of the awards  the related stock based compensation expense and  consequently  our results of operations

capital resources we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million as of december  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
we settled our payment obligations of approximately million in cash and approximately million shares of our stock under the earn out provisions of the rmi merger agreement to the former holders of rmi common stock during december our future cash needs will depend on many factors  including the amount of revenue we generate  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity  and the continuing market acceptance of our products  and any future business acquisitions that we might undertake 
we may seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing  and have a shelf registration allowing us to sell up to million of our securities from time to time during the next three years 
we also might decide to raise additional capital at such times and upon such terms as management considers favorable and in our interests  including  but not limited to  from the sale of our debt and or equity securities before reductions for expenses  underwriting discounts and commissions under our existing shelf registration statement or one or more automatic shelf registration statements that we could file from time to time without advance public disclosure 
we cannot be certain  however  that we will be able to complete offerings of our securities at such times and on such terms as we may consider desirable for us 
contractual obligations our principal commitments as of december  are summarized below in thousands total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations software license obligations wafer purchases total in addition to the enforceable and legally binding obligations quantified in the table above  we have other obligations for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business 
these obligations  however  are either not enforceable or legally binding or are subject to change based on our business decisions 
due to uncertainty with respect to timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have not been included in the contractual obligations table above 
see note income taxes or a discussion on income taxes 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item a ii of regulation s k  other than the indemnities  commitments and guarantees discussed below

these include agreements to indemnify our customers with respect to liabilities associated with the infringement of other parties technology based upon our products  obligations to indemnify our lessors under facility lease agreements  and obligations to indemnify our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the state of delaware 
the duration of such indemnification obligations  commitments and guarantees varies and  in certain cases  is indefinite 
we have not recorded any liability for any such indemnification obligations  commitments and guarantees in the accompanying balance sheets 
we do  however  accrue for losses for any known contingent liability  including those that may arise from indemnification provisions  when future payment is estimable and probable 
we have undertaken specific obligations in the event of an epidemic product failure under master purchase agreements with certain customers 
in the event of an epidemic product failure  our obligations under these arrangements may have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing the risk of loss 
some of the investment securities permitted under our cash management policy may be subject to market risk for changes in interest rates 
to mitigate this risk  we plan to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalent and short term investments in a variety of securities which may include investment grade commercial paper  money market funds  government debt issued by the united states of america  state debt  certificates of deposit and investment grade corporate debt 
presently  we are exposed to minimal market risks associated with interest rate changes 
we manage the sensitivity of our results of operations to these risks by maintaining investment grade short term investments 
our cash management policy does not allow us to purchase or hold derivative or commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
additionally  our policy stipulates that we periodically monitor our investments for adverse material holdings related to the underlying financial solvency of the issuer 
as of december   our marketable securities consisted primarily of deposits in money market funds  us treasuries and government agency securities 
our results of operations and financial condition would not be significantly impacted by either a increase or decrease in interest rates 
our sales outside the united states are transacted in us dollars  accordingly our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes 
our operating expenses are denominated primarily in us dollars  except for expenses incurred by our wholly owned subsidiaries which are denominated in the local currency 
to date  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations
