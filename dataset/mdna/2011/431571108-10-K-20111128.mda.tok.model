hillenbrand recognized of sales tax recoveries as a benefit within operating expenses 
the total net income tax benefit related to these items was results include antitrust litigation expenses and separation costs classified as operating expenses 
the total net income tax benefit related to these items was while we report financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap  we also provide a non gaap measure  earnings before interest  income tax  depreciation  and amortization ebitda 
we have previously discussed our strategy to seek to prudently acquire selected manufacturing businesses that have a record of success and could benefit from our core competencies to spur faster and more profitable growth 
given that strategy  it is a natural consequence to incur related expenses such as amortization from acquired intangible assets and additional interest expense from debt funded acquisitions 
accordingly  we use ebitda  among other measures  to monitor our business performance 
while ebitda is not in accordance with  nor is it a substitute for  a gaap measure  we believe it enables investors to better understand the ongoing operating performance of the company 
investors should consider non gaap measures in addition to  not as a substitute for  or as superior to  measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap

batesville s gross profit margin was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year  with the decline due primarily to rising commodity costs 
process equipment group s gross profit margin increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year  primarily due to inventory step up charges related to acquisitions that were higher in fiscal year compared to fiscal year operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased basis points compared to the prior year 
amortization of intangible assets acquired was in fiscal year compared to in the prior year primarily because fiscal year had months of amortization related to the k tron acquisition versus six months in the prior year 
these amounts include backlog amortization of in and in batesville recorded in recoveries from sales tax overpayments in fiscal year compared to in the prior year that reduced operating expenses 
business acquisition costs were in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year interest expense increased compared to the prior year due primarily to the senior notes issued in july fiscal year included months of related interest expense versus only three months in fiscal year the proceeds from the notes were used to pay down our revolving credit facility  which has a lower interest rate than the senior notes 
investment income and other decreased compared to the prior fiscal year 
interest income related to the forethought note was less in fiscal year due to the early collection of the note in april income from investments in auction rate securities and limited partnerships was higher in fiscal year compared to the prior year 
bank charges primarily for customer payments by credit card were higher in fiscal year see note for more detailed information 
the income tax rate was compared to in the prior year 
the rate was favorably impacted by a decrease in the current and deferred state income tax rates due to enacted law changes  an increase in the percentage of foreign source income in lower rate jurisdictions  an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction  and non deductible business acquisition costs incurred in the previous period

process equipment group s gross profit margin was in fiscal year  which included six months of operations for this group and reflected of inventory step up expensed shortly after the acquisition in operating expenses increased in fiscal year compared to the prior year  and on a percentage of sales basis  it increased to from in the prior year 
the k tron acquisition added of operating expenses in fiscal year this included of amortization of acquired intangible assets  of which was backlog step up amortization 
batesville s operating expenses increased due to increases in compensation and pension  antitrust litigation  and new business initiatives  offset in part by in recoveries from sales tax overpayments that served to reduce operating expenses 
business acquisition costs and restructuring charges were incurred in fiscal year  but not in fiscal year 
table of contents interest expense increased in fiscal year compared to the prior year due to increased borrowings to fund the k tron acquisition  including the issuance of the senior notes in july investment income and other increased in compared to the prior year 
our equity in the results of affiliates represented a gain in fiscal year versus a loss in the prior year 
partially offsetting this was a loss on the sale of auction rate securities in fiscal year see note for more detailed information 
our income tax rate was in fiscal year compared to in the prior year 
the increase in the tax rate was primarily due to non deductible business acquisition costs  higher state income tax rates  and adjustments resulting from periodic reconciliation of our tax accounts to subsequent tax filings  offset in part by favorable changes in our income tax reserves

burial unit volume decreased and was the primary contributor to the reduction  although improved volume on non burial products helped limit the impact 
we believe the volume decrease was attributable to increased cremation rates 
offsetting this impact was a modest increase in average selling price that contributed to revenue 
gross profit batesville s gross profit margin for the year decreased basis points to from in the prior year due primarily to increased commodity costs  in particular  fuel and steel 
operating expenses batesville operating expenses decreased by over the prior year  a basis point improvement in the ratio of operating expense to sales over the prior year 
the primary drivers for this improvement were reductions in antitrust litigation expenses  bad debt expense  and incentive compensation 
this impact was partially offset by restructuring costs and less benefit from recoveries from sales tax overpayments 
in fiscal year  we recovered from sales tax recoveries compared to recovered in the prior year 
we do not expect additional recoveries

commodity costs  particularly for steel  spiked in the first quarter of fiscal year  then declined sharply toward the end of fiscal year  and began to increase again in fiscal year operating expenses batesville operating expenses increased compared to the prior year  an unfavorable basis point change in the operating expense to sales ratio 
this was primarily due to increased variable compensation and pension  increased antitrust litigation expense  additional spending on new business initiatives  offset in part by recoveries from sales tax overpayments 
during fiscal year  batesville discovered that it had over remitted sales tax in certain jurisdictions and recorded of sales tax recoveries  which lowered operating expenses in fiscal year fiscal year ended september  a b process equipment group results in millions amount of revenue amount of revenue revenue gross profit operating expenses operating income depreciation and amortization a fiscal year includes one month of rotex operations since the acquisition on august  b fiscal year includes six months of k tron operations since the acquisition on april  comparative results are not presented for fiscal year as k tron was acquired on april  process equipment group fiscal year ended september   compared to fiscal year ended september  revenue process equipment group revenue increased in fiscal year compared to the prior year  or on a constant currency basis 
fiscal year included months of k tron operations and one month of rotex operations compared to fiscal year that included only six months of k tron operations 
we expect that future revenue associated with process equipment group will be influenced by order backlog 
there is a lead time involved in manufacturing specialized equipment and parts for customers 
backlog can be an indicator of future revenue  however  it may not include many projects and parts orders that are booked and shipped within the same quarter 
the timing of order placement  size  and customer delivery dates can create unusual fluctuations in backlog and revenue 
backlog is also affected by foreign exchange fluctuations for orders denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
based upon an increased level of new orders accepted  including those related to the rotex acquisition  minus orders completed and shipped during the period  process equipment group s backlog increased from on september   to on september  gross profit process equipment group s gross profit margin increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year step ups in inventory value were recorded at the time of the k tron acquisition in april and were subsequently expensed when the inventory was sold in the third quarter of fiscal year  resulting in a reduction to gross profit of similarly  of inventory step ups related to the rotex acquisition were recorded in fiscal year  representing of the inventory step up for this acquisition 
operating expenses process equipment group operating expenses increased compared to the prior year due to months of operations from the k tron businesses and one month from the rotex businesses included in fiscal year compared to only six months of business activity in the prior year 
on an operating expense to sales ratio basis  this represents an improvement of basis points 
amortization of intangible assets acquired was in fiscal year compared to in the prior year primarily because fiscal year had months of 
table of contents amortization related to the k tron acquisition and one month related to the rotex acquisition versus six months related to the k tron acquisition in the prior year 
corporate results fiscal year ended september  in millions operating expenses business acquisition costs restructuring costs separation costs depreciation and amortization excluding business acquisition  restructuring  and separation costs 
operating expenses operating expenses excluding business acquisition and restructuring costs increased for fiscal year compared to the prior year 
long term incentive compensation increased by in our corporate operations  in total for the company  due to having a total of three years of long term incentive compensation grants outstanding in fiscal year versus two years in fiscal year our annual grants began in fiscal year and vest over three years  therefore  fiscal year had two outstanding grants incurring expense and fiscal year had three outstanding grants incurring expense 
going forward  our year over year comparisons will both include three years of related expense 
increases in employee compensation and benefits and legal expenses were incurred in fiscal year compared to as we continue to execute on our global growth strategy  we have incurred additional compensation expense related to our corporate infrastructure and the continued development of our international footprint 
business acquisition costs during fiscal year  we incurred of business acquisition costs related to our acquisitions of rotex and k tron  of which was incurred by our corporate operations 
during fiscal year  we incurred of business acquisition costs related to our acquisition of k tron  of which was incurred by our corporate operations 
restructuring costs during fiscal year  we incurred of restructuring charges related to our joint ownership interests in corporate aircraft distributed to us when we separated from hill rom 
these restructuring charges resulted from our collective plans with hill rom to sell or dispose of two of our jointly owned aircraft and modifications to our aviation access and use agreements 
the charges are primarily related to asset impairments for the two aircraft 
this restructuring will reduce our future costs related to these aviation assets 
liquidity and capital resources we believe the ability to generate cash is critical to the value of the company 
in this section  we tell you about our ability to generate and access cash to meet our business needs 
we will describe actual results in generating and utilizing cash by comparing the last three years 
we will also talk about any significant trends to help you understand how this could impact us going forward 
we will tell you about how we see operating  investing  and financing cash flows being impacted for the next months 
while it is not a certainty  we will tell you where we think cash will come from and how we intend to use it 
we will also talk about significant risks or possible changes that could impact those expectations 
finally  we will tell you about other significant matters that could affect our liquidity on an ongoing basis 

table of contents fiscal year ended september  in millions cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash provided by operating activities was higher in fiscal year compared to fiscal year we received a payment of interest in conjunction with the final settlement of the forethought note in  compared to the contractual payment received in the prior year 
process equipment group s core pre tax operating cash flows contributed approximately more to our consolidated operating cash flows in fiscal compared to the prior year  as months of operations were included in compared to six months in the prior year 
cash payments for income taxes decreased in fiscal year cash provided by operating activities was lower in fiscal year compared to fiscal year cash payments for income taxes increased in fiscal year compared to the prior year  primarily due to the addition of k tron 
k tron s core pre tax operating cash flows contributed approximately to our consolidated operating cash flows for the last six months of fiscal we paid in business acquisition costs in fiscal year we received a interest payment from forethought in we made cash payments of to fund our deferred compensation program in fiscal year we paid less in defined benefit plan contributions in fiscal year investing activities cash used for investing activities was lower in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the rotex acquisition required a net cash payment in fiscal year compared to paid for k tron in the prior year 
we received a repayment of of principal on the forethought note in fiscal year capital project spending was more in fiscal year compared to the prior year 
we received from our auction rate securities and investments  representing a decrease from the prior year 
cash used for investing activities was higher in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the k tron acquisition required a net cash payout in capital project spending was more in fiscal year compared to the prior year 
we received from the partial liquidation of our auction rate securities and investments  representing a increase from the prior year 

table of contents financing activities cash used in financing activities was in fiscal year compared to net cash receipts of in the prior year 
we used of proceeds from the collection of the forethought note to pay down our revolving credit facilities 
we borrowed under our revolving credit facilities to fund the acquisition of rotex 
cash provided by financing activities increased in fiscal year compared to the prior year 
we borrowed under our revolving credit facilities to fund the acquisition of k tron 
we received from the issuance of the senior unsecured notes notes 
these proceeds were subsequently used to pay owed on our revolving credit facility and the remaining amount was used to fund working capital needs 
month outlook we believe that our cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and cash available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund operations  working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements  and financing obligations 
we may use additional cash generated by the business to pay down our revolving credit facility  depending on our working capital needs 
the cash at our foreign subsidiaries totaled at september  repatriation of these funds for use in domestic operations would expose us to a potential additional tax impact 
approximately of these funds are permanently reinvested and we have no plans to repatriate these funds 
we expect that our available borrowing capacity combined with cash flows expected from existing business will be sufficient to fund operating requirements in the us we expect to continue moving forward with our acquisition strategy  however  additional acquisitions will depend on whether suitable opportunities are available 
we expect to fund future acquisitions primarily with cash on hand  although we may utilize availability under our revolving credit facilities 
the covenants under the distribution agreement with hill rom impose certain restrictions on incurring indebtedness to finance acquisitions 
see note for further detail 
we did not make discretionary contributions to our pension plans in we are not required  nor do we currently have plans to do so in we will continue to monitor plan funding levels  performance of the assets within the plan  and overall economic activity  and will make potential funding decisions based on the net impact of the above factors 
we currently expect that comparable quarterly cash dividends will continue to be paid in the future and will require approximately each quarter based on our outstanding common stock at september  we are currently authorized by our board of directors to purchase additional shares of our common stock  and may elect to do so  depending on market conditions and other needs for cash consistent with our growth strategy 
other liquidity matters in march  we entered into a five year senior revolving credit facility the facility with a syndicate of banks the banks 
the facility expires in march borrowings under the facility bear interest at variable rates  based upon the banks base rate or libor plus a margin amount based upon our public debt rating 
for fiscal years ended september  and  the weighted average interest rates were and 
the availability of borrowings under the facility is subject to our ability at the time of borrowing to meet certain specified conditions 
these conditions include compliance with covenants  absence of default  and continued accuracy of certain representations and warranties 
financial covenants include a maximum ratio of consolidated 
table of contents indebtedness to consolidated ebitda of to and a minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense of to as of september   we had outstanding letters of credit under the facility and were in compliance with all covenants 
we had of remaining borrowing capacity available under the facility 
under the distribution agreement with hill rom  the ability to borrow against the facility for certain strategic transactions such as acquisitions may be limited 
see note for more information 
our swiss location maintains additional availability of through local credit facilities secured by cash or real property 
as of september  and  there were no borrowings under these facilities and availability was reduced by and for outstanding bank guarantees 
at september  and  we had additional outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees with other financial institutions totaling and we had restricted cash of at september  off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments in this section we will tell you about the things we have committed to pay 
this will help give you an understanding of the significance of cash outlays that are fixed beyond the normal accounts payable we have already incurred and have on our books 
the following table outlines our contractual obligations as of september  payment due by period in millions total less than year years years after years year  fixed rate senior unsecured notes revolving credit facility interest on financing agreements operating lease obligations noncancellable purchase obligations defined benefit plan funding other long term liabilities capital call arrangements total contractual obligations our revolving credit facility expires in march although we may make earlier principal payments  we have reflected the principal balance due at expiration 
cash obligations for interest requirements relate to our fixed rate debt obligation at its contractual rate and borrowings under the variable rate revolving credit facility at current rate at september  consists of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
defined benefit plan funding represents non discretionary requirements based upon plan funding at september   and excludes any discretionary contributions 
other long term liabilities include the estimated liquidation of liabilities related to our casket pricing obligation  self insurance reserves  and long term severance payments 
we could be called upon by our private equity limited partnership investments to provide a maximum of in additional funds 

table of contents critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods 
significant accounting policies which require management s judgment are discussed below 
a detailed description of our accounting policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item  of this form k 
revenue recognition net revenue includes gross revenue less sales discounts  customer rebates  sales incentives  and product returns  all of which require us to make estimates for the portion of these allowances that have yet to be credited or paid to our customers 
we estimate these allowances based upon historical rates and projections of customer purchases toward contractual rebate thresholds 
allowance for doubtful accounts the accounting for our trade receivables requires us to estimate the net realizable value of these assets 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses and collection risk in our existing trade accounts receivable portfolio 
performing our evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires us to exercise significant judgment based on historical write offs and individual customer collection experience 
as a result  the historical experience and current trends we are using in our estimates may not be indicative of the collectability of these balances in the future 
liabilities for loss contingencies related to claims and lawsuits the ultimate outcome of claims and lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty 
an estimated loss from these contingencies is recognized when we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
making such an estimate requires us to exercise significant judgment 
however  it is difficult to measure the actual loss that might be incurred related to litigation 
the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
for a more complete description of loss contingencies related to lawsuits  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item  of this form k 
we are also involved in other possible claims  including product and general liability  workers compensation  auto liability  and employment related matters 
outside insurance companies and third party claims administrators establish individual claim reserves and an independent outside actuary provides estimates of ultimate projected losses  including incurred but not reported claims  which are used to establish reserves for losses 
as our actuaries periodically provide us updated ultimate loss projections  we must increase or reduce previously recorded claim reserves 
thus  any one period s financial results could be significantly affected by the effect of this adjustment 
the recorded amounts represent our best estimate of the costs we will incur in relation to such exposures  but it is possible that actual costs could differ from those estimates 
performance based stock compensation the vesting of our performance based stock awards is contingent upon the creation of shareholder value as measured by the cumulative cash returns and final period net operating profit after tax compared to the established hurdle rate over a three year period 
the hurdle rate is a reflection of our weighted average cost of capital and targeted capital structure 
the value of an award is based upon the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
based on the extent to which the performance criteria are achieved  it is possible for none of the awards to vest or for a range up to the maximum to vest  which is reflected in the performance based stock award table in note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item  of this form k 
we record expense associated with the awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period based upon an estimate of projected performance 
the actual performance of the company is evaluated quarterly  and the expense is adjusted according to the new projection if it has changed significantly 
as a result  depending on the degree to which we achieve the performance criteria or our projection changes  our expenses related to the performance based stock awards may become more volatile as we approach the final performance measurement date at the end of the three years 
this increase in volatility stems from the requirement to increase or reduce compensation expense as the projection of performance changes 
thus  any one period s financial results could be significantly affected by the cumulative effect of the adjustment 
preparing the projection of performance requires us to exercise significant judgment as to the expected outcome of final performance up to three years in the future 
in making the projection  we consider both actual results and probable business plans for the future 
at september   we have recorded cumulative compensation expense associated with unvested performance based stock awards of  
table of contents which continues to be subject to periodic adjustments as the related awards approach the final performance measurement date 
retirement and postretirement plans we sponsor retirement and postretirement benefit plans covering a majority of our employees 
expense recognized for the plans is based upon actuarial valuations 
inherent in those valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected returns on assets  and projected future salary rates 
the discount rates used in the valuation of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are evaluated annually based on current market conditions 
in setting the discount rate  we use a yield curve approach to discount each expected cash flow of the liability stream at an interest rate applicable to the timing of each cash flow based on corporate bond rates 
these present values are then converted into an equivalent weighted average discount rate 
our overall expected long term rate of return on pension assets is based on historical and expected future returns  which are inflation adjusted and weighted for the expected return for each component of the investment portfolio 
our rate of assumed compensation increase for pension benefits is also based on our specific historical trends of past wage adjustments in recent years and expectations for the future 
changes in retirement and postretirement benefit expense and the recognized obligations may occur in the future as a result of a number of factors  including changes to any of these assumptions 
our weighted average expected rate of return on pension assets was   and at the end of fiscal   and a basis point increase in the expected rate of return on domestic pension assets of reduces annual pension expense by the weighted average discount rate decreased to and at the end of fiscal for the pension and postretirement healthcare plan expense 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate increases the annual domestic pension expense by the impact of this decrease to our postretirement healthcare plan expense would be less than impacts from assumption changes could be positive or negative depending on the direction of the change in rates 
based upon the new rates and assumptions  we expect the aggregate expense associated with our defined benefit plans  not including the expense of the rotex plans  to increase from in fiscal to in fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item  of this form k  for key assumptions and other information regarding our retirement and postretirement benefit plans 
uncertain income tax positions in assessing the need for reserves for uncertain tax positions  we have to make judgments regarding the technical merit of a tax position and  when necessary  an estimate of the settlement amount based upon what we think is the probability of the outcome 
at september   we had reserves of established for uncertain tax positions based upon our estimates 
our ability to make and update these estimates is limited to the information we have at any given point in time 
this information can include how taxing authorities have treated the position in the past  how similar cases have settled  or where we are in discussions or negotiations with taxing authorities on a particular issue  among others 
as information available to us evolves  we update our reserves quarterly 
these updates can result in volatility to our income tax rate particularly to a given quarter if new information or developments result in a significant change in our estimate 
business combinations on october   we adopted a new accounting standard that governs how to account for and disclose business combinations 
with a few exceptions  the standard requires that we record the assets and liabilities of the acquired business at estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
estimating fair value for acquired assets and liabilities as part of a business combination typically requires us to exercise judgment  particularly for those assets and liabilities that may be unique or not easily determined by reference to market data 
often estimates for these types of acquired assets and liabilities will be developed using valuation models that require both historical and forecasted inputs  as well as market participant expectations 
thus the valuation is directly affected by the inputs we judge as best under the given circumstances 
when material  we expect to seek assistance of competent valuation professionals when the underlying valuation is more complex or unique 
we anticipate that in most cases  we will exercise significant judgment in estimating the fair value of intangible assets customer lists or relationships  trademarks  etc  for example  contingent liabilities loss reserves  for example  and contingent consideration earn outs  for example 
this list is not exhaustive  but is designed to give you a better understanding of where we think a larger degree of judgment will be required due to the nature of the item and the way it is typically valued 
depreciable and amortizable lives of long lived assets the recording of depreciation and amortization expense requires management to exercise significant judgment in estimating the economic useful lives of long lived assets  
table of contents particularly intangible assets 
management s assumptions regarding the following factors  among others  affect the determination of estimated economic useful life management s experience with similar assets  changes in technology  utilization  wear and tear  estimated cash flows expected to be generated by the asset  and changes in market demand 
as our assessment is performed on a periodic basis  changes in any management assumptions may result in a shorter or longer estimated useful life for an asset than originally anticipated 
in such a case  we would depreciate or amortize the remaining net book value of the asset over the new estimated remaining life  thereby increasing or decreasing depreciation or amortization expense per year on a prospective basis 
as a result  our estimates at any point in time may not be indicative of future circumstances 
asset impairment determinations accounting standards require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be tested for impairment at least annually or when circumstances would suggest that impairment may have occurred 
testing of either goodwill or indefinite lived assets requires that we estimate the fair value of the asset in question 
estimating fair value for these assets typically requires us to exercise significant judgment  particularly for asset values that are not easily determined by reference to market data 
often estimates for these types of assets are developed using valuation models that require both historical and forecasted inputs  as well as market participant expectations 
thus the valuation is directly affected by the inputs we judge as best under the given circumstances 
in analyzing the future cash flows of various assets  critical assumptions we make may include some of the following the intended use of assets and the expected cash flows resulting directly from such use  industry specific economic conditions  customer preferences and behavior patterns  and the impact of applicable regulatory initiatives  if any 
our assumptions are sometimes subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we make are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could result in an impairment charge which could materially impact our reported financial results by decreasing operating income and lowering asset values on our consolidated balance sheet 
when material  we expect to seek assistance of competent valuation professionals when the underlying valuation is more complex or unique 
tangible and other intangible assets that are subject to depreciation and amortization are also evaluated when circumstances suggest that impairment may have occurred 
testing of these assets requires that we estimate future cash flows associated with the asset s in question 
recently issued and adopted accounting standards for a summary of recently issued and adopted accounting standards applicable to us  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item  of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this section  we tell you about market risks we think could have a significant impact on our bottom line or the financial strength of our company 
market risks generally mean how results of operations and the value of assets and liabilities could be affected by market factors such as interest rates  currency exchange rates  the value of commodities  and debt and equity price risks 
if those factors change significantly  it could help or hurt our bottom line  depending on how we react to them 
we are exposed to various market risks 
we have established policies  procedures  and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
our primary exposures are to collection risk customer receivables  fluctuations in market prices for certain purchases of commodities  variability in exchange rates in foreign locations  and volatility in the fair value of our investments 
we also have some interest rate exposure 
what follows are the specifics 

table of contents we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain purchased commodity raw materials including steel  wood  red metals  and fuel 
while these materials are typically available from multiple suppliers  commodity raw materials are subject to market price fluctuations 
we generally buy these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the supplier as part of the purchasing process 
we generally attempt to obtain firm pricing from our larger suppliers for volumes consistent with planned production 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers  or if our suppliers are not able to honor such prices  we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain supply chain efficiencies to offset increases in commodity costs 
we are subject to volatility in our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio includes private equity limited partnerships and common stock with an aggregate carrying value of at september  these investments could be adversely affected by general economic conditions  changes in interest rates  default on debt instruments  and other factors  resulting in an adverse impact 
the changes in the fair value of the limited partnerships underlying investment portfolios can impact us significantly because we record our share of the change in our income statement under the equity method of accounting 
our pension plans assets are also subject to volatility that can be caused by fluctuation in general economic conditions 
plan assets are invested by the plans fiduciaries  which direct investments according to specific policies 
those policies subject investments to the following restrictions in our domestic plan short term securities must be rated a p or higher  fixed income securities must have a quality credit rating of bbb or higher  and investments in equities in any one company may not exceed of the equity portfolio 
our income statement is currently shielded from volatility in plan assets due to the way accounting standards are applied for pension plans  although favorable or unfavorable investment performance over the long term will impact our pension expense if it deviates from our assumption related to future rate of return 
our exposure to exchange rates are primarily i the us dollar versus each of the swiss franc  the euro  the british pound sterling  the canadian dollar  and the swedish krona and ii the swiss franc versus the euro and the british pound sterling 
from time to time we may enter into currency exchange agreements to manage our exposure arising from fluctuating exchange rates related to specific transactions  primarily forecasted intercompany purchasing 
foreign cash balances in currencies other than the swiss franc are limited in order to manage the transaction exposure caused by the marking to market of non swiss franc balances to swiss franc values on the balance sheet of our swiss operations 
as of september   a change in the foreign exchange rates affecting balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a change in pre tax earnings of approximately this hypothetical change on transactional exposures is based on the difference between the september   actual foreign exchange rates and hypothetical rates assuming a change in foreign exchange rates on that date 
we expect to expand our hedging program in fiscal to help reduce earnings volatility that could occur associated with the non swiss franc balances of our swiss operations 
the translation of the balance sheets of our non us operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign exchange rates 
these translation gains or losses are recorded as cumulative translation adjustments cta within accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet 
using the example above  the hypothetical change in cta would be calculated by multiplying the net assets of our non us operations by a change in the applicable foreign exchange rates 
the result of this calculation would be to change shareholders equity by approximately as of september  at september   we had outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
we are subject to interest rate risk associated with our revolving credit facility which bears a variable rate of interest that is based upon the lender s base rate or the libor rate 
the interest we pay on our borrowings is dependent on interest rate conditions and the timing of our financing needs 
assuming our borrowings were to remain at for months  a one percentage point move in the related interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately
