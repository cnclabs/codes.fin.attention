item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussions should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this report  including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item of this annual report on form k 
overview we operate in four reportable business segments of the heating  ventilation  air conditioning and refrigeration  hvacr industry 
our reportable segments are residential heating cooling  commercial heating cooling  service experts and refrigeration 
for more detailed information regarding our reportable segments  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our products and services are sold through a combination of distributors  independent and company owned dealer service centers  other installing contractors  wholesalers  manufacturers representatives  original equipment manufacturers and to national accounts 
the demand for our products and services is seasonal and dependent on the weather 
warmer than normal summer temperatures generate strong demand for replacement air conditioning and refrigeration products and services and colder than normal winter temperatures have the same effect on heating products and services 
conversely  cooler than normal summers and warmer than normal winters depress hvacr sales and services 
in addition to weather  demand for our products and services is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors  such as interest rates  the availability of financing  regional population and employment trends  new construction  general economic conditions and consumer spending habits and confidence 
a substantial portion of the sales in each of our business segments is attributable to replacement business  with the balance comprised of new construction business 
the principal elements of cost of goods sold in our manufacturing operations are components  raw materials  factory overhead  labor and estimated costs of warranty expense 
in our service experts segment  the principal components of cost of goods sold are equipment  parts and supplies and labor 
the principal raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel  copper and aluminum 
in recent years  the volatility of commodity prices and related components has impacted us and the hvacr industry in general 
we endeavor to mitigate the impact of higher commodity prices through a combination of price increases  commodity contracts  improved production 
table of contents efficiency and cost reduction initiatives 
we also partially mitigate volatility in the prices of these commodities by entering into futures contracts and fixed forward contracts

for the year  we saw rates of decline increase across all segments 
however  our end markets showed improvement late in the year and particularly in the fourth quarter  with our residential hvac end markets showing growth in the fourth quarter 
the commercial hvac and refrigeration markets were still down from a year ago  but the rate of decline continued to slow in the fourth quarter

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our working capital and capital expenditure requirements are generally met through internally generated funds  bank lines of credit and a revolving period asset securitization arrangement 
working capital needs are generally greater in the first and second quarters due to the seasonal nature of our business cycle 
statement of cash flows the following table summarizes our cash activity for  and in millions in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash provided by operating activities during  cash provided by operating activities was lower than in primarily due to increased working capital needs in support of our sales growth

in capital expenditures were lower due to project timing and are anticipated to increase in to similar levels as and on january   we paid million  including a purchase price working capital adjustment  to complete the kysor warren acquisition 
net cash used in financing activities net borrowings of long term debt  short term borrowings and revolving long term payments totaled approximately million in compared to net payments of million in during  we used approximately million to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase plans 
debt position and financial leverage our debt to total capital ratio increased to as of december  from as of december  due to higher outstanding debt 
for a detailed description regarding our debt including our debt covenants  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had outstanding long term debt obligations totaling million  which increased from million as of december  the amount outstanding as of december  
table of contents consisted primarily of outstanding borrowings of million under our domestic revolving credit facility  which matures in  and million of senior unsecured notes 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings of million under our million domestic revolving credit facility and million was committed to standby letters of credit 
the remaining million was available for future borrowings subject to covenant limitations 
the facility matures in october as of december   we were in compliance with all covenant requirements 
our domestic revolving credit facility includes a subfacility for swingline loans of up to million and provides for the issuance of letters of credit for the full amount available under the domestic revolving credit facility 
our weighted average borrowing rate on the domestic revolving credit facility was and as of december  and  respectively 
our domestic revolving credit facility contains financial covenants relating to leverage and interest coverage 
other covenants contained in our domestic revolving credit facility restrict  among other things  mergers  asset dispositions  guarantees  debt  liens  acquisitions  investments  affiliate transactions and our ability to make restricted payments 
the financial covenants require us to maintain defined levels of consolidated indebtedness to adjusted ebitda ratio and a cash flow defined as ebitda minus capital expenditures to net interest expense ratio 
the required ratios as of december  are detailed below consolidated indebtedness to adjusted ebitda ratio not greater than cash flow to net interest expense ratio no less than our domestic revolving credit facility contains customary events of default 
these events of default include nonpayment of principal or interest  breach of covenants or other restrictions or requirements  default on any other indebtedness or receivables securitizations cross default  and bankruptcy 
a cross default under our revolving credit facility could occur if we fail to pay any principal or interest when due on any other indebtedness or receivables securitization of at least million  or we are in default in the performance of  or compliance with any term of any other indebtedness or receivables securitization in an aggregate principal amount of at least million  or any other condition exists which would give the holders the right to declare such indebtedness due and payable prior to its stated maturity 
each of our major debt agreements contains provisions by which a default under one agreement causes a default in the others a cross default 
if a cross default under the revolving credit facility  our senior unsecured notes  or our revolving period asset securitization program were to occur  it could have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise occur from a default of a single debt instrument or lease commitment 
if any event of default occurs and is continuing  lenders with a majority of the aggregate commitments may require the administrative agent to terminate our right to borrow under our domestic revolving credit facility and accelerate amounts due under our domestic revolving credit facility except for a bankruptcy event of default  in which case such amounts will automatically become due and payable and the lenders commitments will automatically terminate 
on may   we issued million of senior unsecured notes due may  bearing fixed interest at as a result of a public offering of securities

upon a change of control  holders of our notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the senior unsecured notes at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes repurchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
the notes are guaranteed  on a senior unsecured basis  by each of our domestic subsidiaries that guarantee payment by us of any indebtedness under our domestic revolving credit 
table of contents facility 
the indenture governing the notes contains covenants that  among other things  limit our ability and the ability of the subsidiary guarantors to create or incur certain liens  enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions  enter into certain mergers  consolidations and transfers of substantially all of our assets  and transfer certain properties 
the indenture also contains a cross default provision which is triggered if we default on other debt of at least million in principal which is then accelerated  and such acceleration is not rescinded within days of the notice date 
under a revolving period asset securitization arrangement asa  we are eligible to transfer beneficial interests in a portion of our trade accounts receivable to third parties in exchange for cash 
our continued involvement in the transferred assets includes servicing  collection and administration of the transferred beneficial interests 
the sale of the beneficial interests in our trade accounts receivable are reflected as secured borrowings 
the fair values assigned to the retained and transferred interests are based primarily on the receivables carrying value given the short term to maturity and low credit risk 
the asa provides for a maximum securitization amount of million or of the net pool balance as defined by the asa 
however  eligibility for securitization is limited based on the amount and quality of the qualifying accounts receivable and is calculated monthly 
the beneficial interest sold cannot exceed the maximum amount even if our qualifying accounts receivable is greater than the maximum amount at any point in time 
the eligible amounts available and beneficial interests sold were as follows in millions as of as of december  december  eligible amount available under the asa on qualified accounts receivable beneficial interest sold remaining amount available as of december   million of cash and cash equivalents were restricted and held in a trust for our captive insurance subsidiary 
we periodically review our capital structure  including our primary bank facility  to ensure that it has adequate liquidity 
we believe that cash flows from operations  as well as available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other existing sources of funding  will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future and share repurchases under the terms of our share repurchase plan 
during the third quarter of  we amended the lease agreement for our corporate headquarters 
while the same party continues to be the lessor under the lease  the amendment  among other things  replaced the debt participant and moderately increased the rent payments 
the amendment also provides for financial covenants consistent with our domestic revolving credit agreement and we are in compliance with these financial covenants 
the lease will continue to be accounted for as an operating lease 
during  we expanded our tifton  georgia manufacturing facility using the proceeds from industrial development bonds idbs 
we entered into a lease agreement with the owner of the property and the issuer of the idbs  and through our lease payments fund the interest payments to investors in the idbs 
we also guaranteed the repayment of the idbs and entered into letters of credit totaling million to fund a potential repurchase of the idbs in the event that investors exercised their right to tender the idbs to the trustee 
as of december  and  we recorded both a long term asset and a corresponding long term obligation of million related to these transactions 
off balance sheet arrangements in addition to the credit facilities and promissory notes described above  we also lease real estate and machinery and equipment pursuant to operating leases that are not capitalized on the balance sheet  including high turnover equipment such as autos and service vehicles and short lived equipment such as personal computers 
rent expense for these leases was million  million and million in  and  respectively

due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of payments associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
purchase obligations consist of aluminum commitments 
the above table does not include retirement  postretirement and warranty liabilities because it is not certain when these liabilities will be funded

contractual obligations related to capital leases as of december  were included as part of long term debt in the table above 
fair value measurements fair value hierarchy the three level fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements are defined as follows level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets at the measurement date 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets at the measurement date and for the anticipated term of the instrument 
level valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
fair value techniques general our valuation techniques are applied to all of the assets and liabilities carried at fair value 
where available  the fair values are based upon quoted prices in active markets 
however  if quoted prices are not available  then the fair values are based upon quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or independently sourced market parameters  such as credit default swap spreads  yield curves  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  interest rates and benchmark securities 
for assets and liabilities with a lack of observable market activity  if any  the fair values are based upon discounted cash flow methodologies incorporating assumptions that  in our judgment  reflect the assumptions a marketplace participant would use 
to ensure that financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value  valuation adjustments may be required to reflect either party s creditworthiness and ability to pay 
where appropriate  these amounts were incorporated into our valuations as of december  and  the measurement dates 

table of contents derivatives derivatives are primarily valued using estimated future cash flows that are based directly on observed prices from exchange traded derivatives and  therefore  have been classified as level we also take into account the counterparty s creditworthiness  or our own creditworthiness  as appropriate 
an adjustment has been recorded in order to reflect the risk of credit default  but these adjustments have been insignificant to the overall value of the derivatives 
pension plan assets the majority of our commingled pool collective trust  mutual funds and balanced pension trusts are managed by professional investment advisors 
the net asset values nav per share are furnished in monthly and or quarterly statements received from the investment advisors and reflect valuations based upon their pricing policies 
we have assessed the classification of the inputs used to value these investments at level for mutual funds and level for commingled pool collective trusts and balance pension trusts through examination of their pricing policies and the related controls and procedures 
the fair values we report are based on the pool or trust s nav per share 
the nav s per share are calculated periodically daily or no less than one time per month as the aggregate value of each pool or trust s underlying assets divided by the number of units owned 
market risk commodity price risk we enter into commodity futures contracts to stabilize prices expected to be paid for raw materials and parts containing high copper and aluminum content 
these contracts are for quantities equal to or less than quantities expected to be consumed in future production 
fluctuations in metal commodity prices impact the value of the derivative instruments that we hold 
when metal commodity prices rise  the fair value of our futures contracts increases and conversely  when commodity prices fall  the fair value of our futures contracts decreases 
information about our exposure to market risks related to metal commodity prices and a sensitivity analysis related to our metal commodity hedges is presented below in millions notional amount pounds carrying amount and fair value of asset change in fair value from change in forward prices interest rate risk our results of operations can be affected by changes in interest rates due to variable rates of interest on our revolving credit facilities  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in order to partially mitigate interest rate risk  we use a hedging strategy to eliminate the variability of cash flows in the interest payments for the first million of the total variable rate debt outstanding under the domestic revolving credit facility that is solely due to changes in the benchmark interest rate 
this strategy allows us to fix a portion of our interest payments while also taking advantage of historically low interest rates 
on june   we entered into a million pay fixed  receive variable interest rate swap with a large financial institution at a fixed interest rate of 
the variable portion of the interest rate swap is tied to month libor the benchmark interest rate 
the interest rates under both the interest rate swap and the underlying debt are reset  the swap is settled with the counterparty  and interest is paid  on a monthly basis 
the interest rate swap expires october  we account for the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge 

table of contents information about our exposure to interest rate risk and a sensitivity analysis related to our interest rate swap is presented below in millions notional amount impact of a basis point change in the benchmark interest rate carrying amount and fair value of liability interest expense foreign currency exchange rate risk our results of operations can be affected by changes in exchange rates 
net sales and expenses in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes based on the average exchange rate for the period 
during  and  net sales from outside the us represented  and  respectively  of our total net sales 
historically  foreign currency transaction gains losses have not had a material effect on our overall operations 
as of december   the impact to net income of a change in exchange rates is estimated to be approximately million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates 
the critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better understanding of how we develop our judgments about future events and related estimations and how such policies can impact our financial statements 
a critical accounting policy is one that requires difficult  subjective or complex estimates and assessments and is fundamental to the results of operations 
we consider our most critical accounting policies to be goodwill and other intangible assets  product warranties  pension and postretirement benefits  self insurance expense  derivative accounting  and income taxes 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in
