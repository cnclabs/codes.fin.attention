table of contents the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a rapidly growing commercial stage  multi specialty pharmaceutical company developing  marketing and selling our own products in the us and puerto rico 
we are the fourth largest branded prescription eye care business in the us and have an emerging allergy drug franchise 
we manufacture our finished good products through third party contracts  and we in license or acquire new technology to add to our internal development efforts from time to time 
our products and product candidates seek to treat allergy and serious diseases of the eye and include therapies for ocular inflammation and pain  glaucoma  dry eye and ocular and nasal allergies 
the us prescription markets our therapies seek to address include key segments of the billion ophthalmic pharmaceutical market and the billion nasal allergy market 
we currently have five products available for sale in the us and puerto rico bromday bromfenac ophthalmic solution for the treatment of postoperative inflammation and reduction of ocular pain in patients who have undergone cataract extractions  bepreve bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis  istalol timolol maleate ophthalmic solution for the treatment of glaucoma  vitrase hyaluronidase injection ovine  usp units ml for use as a spreading agent and xibrom bromfenac ophthalmic solution for the treatment of inflammation and pain following cataract surgery 
in addition  we have several eye and allergy product candidates in various stages of development  including treatments for dry eye  ocular inflammation and pain and nasal allergies 
we have incurred losses since inception and have a stockholders deficit of approximately million including non cash valuation warrant adjustments of million through december  results of operations years ended december   and revenues 
net revenues were approximately million in  as compared to million in and million in the increase in revenues in is the result of the following increased growth in prescription levels and market share for our core products  particularly for xibrom  increased revenues from a full year of bepreve  increased revenues due to vitrase gaining market share  launch of our newest product  bromday  in the fourth quarter of  offset by the elimination of license revenue that we earned in the following table sets forth our net revenues for each of our products for the years ended december    and  respectively dollars in millions years ended december  bromday and xibrom istalol vitrase bepreve product sales  net license revenue total revenues gross margin and cost of products sold 
gross margin for was  or million  as compared to  or million  for and  or million  for the increase in gross margin in as compared to and is primarily the result of continued increased growth in prescription levels and market share  particularly for xibrom and bepreve  our higher gross margin products  as well as the launch of bromday 

table of contents cost of products sold was million in  as compared to million in and million in cost of products sold for the three years consisted primarily of standard costs for each of our commercial products  distribution costs  royalties  inventory reserves and other costs of products sold 
the increase in cost of products sold is primarily the result of increased net revenues 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were in  million in  and million in research and development costs in included total milestone payments of million to senju for the fda s acceptance and approval of our bepreve nda 
excluding these payments  recurring research and development expenses increased approximately million in  as compared to the increase was primarily the result of an increase in clinical development costs  which include clinical investigator fees  study monitoring costs  data management costs  and manufacturing costs 
during  the increase in costs resulted from the initiation of the phase efficacy and safety dry eye trials for remura  the initiation of bepotastine nasal phase studies and the initiation of the phase bepotastine nasal clinical trials 
research and development expenses in included costs associated with our bromday and t pred trials and costs incurred to support our bepreve nda 
we expect clinical development costs to increase in as we plan to complete the bepotastine nasal trials  file an ind application to initiate the bepotastine nasal combination study and complete the remura dry eye trials 
our research and development expenses to date have consisted primarily of costs associated with the clinical trials of our product candidates  compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  costs for consultants and contract research organizations and costs related to the development of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities for bromday  bepreve  istalol  vitrase and xibrom 
generally  our research and development resources are not dedicated to a single project but are applied to multiple product candidates in our portfolio 
as a result  we manage and evaluate our research and development expenditures generally by the type of costs incurred 
we generally classify and separate research and development expenditures into amounts related to clinical development costs  regulatory costs  pharmaceutical development costs  manufacturing development costs and medical affairs costs 
in addition  we also record as research and development expenses any up front and milestone payments that have been accrued to third parties prior to regulatory approval of a product candidate under our licensing agreements unless there is an alternative future use 
in  approximately of our research and development expenditures were for clinical development costs  were for regulatory costs  were for pharmaceutical development costs  were for manufacturing development costs  were for medical affairs costs  and approximately for stock based compensation costs million 
changes in our research and development expenses in as compared to were primarily due to the following clinical development costs overall clinical development costs  which include clinical investigator fees  study monitoring costs and data management  were million for as compared to million for  or an increase of million 
the increase in costs resulted from the initiation of the phase efficacy and safety dry eye trials for remura  the initiation of bepotastine nasal phase studies and the initiation of the phase bepotastine nasal clinical trials 
research and development expenses in included costs associated with our bromday and t pred trials and costs incurred to support our bepreve nda 
regulatory costs regulatory costs  which include compliance expenses for existing products and other activity for pipeline projects  were million in as compared to million for the decrease of million was primarily due to the costs incurred in for the preparation of our snda filing for bromday and our participation in an fda advisory panel for bepreve 
pharmaceutical development costs pharmaceutical development costs  which include costs related to the testing and development of our pipeline products  were million in both and manufacturing development costs manufacturing development costs  which include costs related to production scale up and validation  raw material qualification  and stability studies  were million for as compared to million for  or an increase of million 
medical affairs costs medical affairs costs  which include activities that relate to medical information in support of our products  were million for  as compared to million for the increase of million was primarily due higher personnel related costs due to higher headcount and physician education programs and publications  offset by a decrease in post marketing clinical studies related to our existing commercial products 
in  approximately of our research and development expenditures were for clinical development costs  were for regulatory costs  were for pharmaceutical development costs  were for manufacturing development costs  were for medical affairs costs  for milestone payments and approximately for stock based compensation costs million 

table of contents changes in our research and development expenses in as compared to were primarily due to the following clinical development costs overall clinical development costs were million for as compared to million for  or a decrease of million 
the decrease is due in part to the variation in the initiation  timing and completion of clinical studies year over year 
in  costs included those associated with our xibrom once daily and t pred studies and costs incurred in support of our bepreve nda 
there was a significant reduction in of our clinical costs as the work on bepreve was substantially completed 
additionally  we filed our bepreve nda in and received approval from the fda to market bepreve in regulatory costs regulatory costs were million for as compared to million for  or an increase of million 
pharmaceutical development costs pharmaceutical development costs were million in both and manufacturing development costs manufacturing development costs were million for as compared to million for  or a decrease of million 
the decrease was due primarily to a reduction in outside consulting costs and research related costs such as clinical supplies and stability studies 
medical affairs costs medical affairs costs were million for as compared to million for the increase of million was primarily due to post marketing studies related to our existing commercial products 
our research and development activities reflect our efforts to advance our product candidates through the various stages of product development 
the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our development plans are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may affect our research and development expenditures and capital resources 
for instance  the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly depending on a variety of factors including a trial s protocol  the number of patients in the trial  the duration of patient follow up  the number of clinical sites in the trial  and the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
even if earlier results are positive  we may obtain different results in later stages of development  including failure to show the desired safety or efficacy  which could impact our development expenditures for a particular product candidate 
although we spend a considerable amount of time planning our development activities  we may be required to deviate from our plan based on new circumstances or events or our assessment from time to time of a product candidate s market potential  other product opportunities and our corporate priorities 
any deviation from our plan may require us to incur additional expenditures or accelerate or delay the timing of our development spending 
furthermore  as we obtain results from trials and review the path toward regulatory approval  we may elect to discontinue development of certain product candidates in certain indications  in order to focus our resources on more promising candidates or indications 
as a result  the amount or ranges of estimable cost and timing to complete our product development programs and each future product development program is not estimable 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were in  million in and million in the million increase in as compared to was primarily attributable to higher sales and marketing expenses associated with a full year of marketing bepreve and launching bromday million  the addition of approximately new sales representatives million and an overall increase in administrative costs million 
the million increase in as compared to was primarily attributable to higher sales and marketing expenses associated with launching bepreve and expanding our sales force million  an overall increase in administrative costs million  offset by a decrease in stock based compensation costs million 
stock based compensation costs 
total stock based compensation costs for the years ended december    and were million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we granted options to employees to purchase million shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share  equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the time of grant 
in addition to stock options  we also issued restricted stock awards 
total stock based compensation costs for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively  related to these restricted stock awards 
the following table sets forth our stock based compensation costs for the years ended december   and  respectively dollars in millions years ended december  selling  general and administrative research and development stock based compensation costs 
table of contents interest income 
interest income was zero in and and million in the decrease in interest income in and was because we sought to protect our principal and maintained all of our cash balances in non interest bearing accounts 
at december   we had invested million in low interest us treasury funds 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in  million in and million in the components of interest expense are as follows dollars in millions years ended december  interest related to the facility agreement amortization of the discount on the facility agreement amortization of the discount on the subordinated convertible notes amortization of deferred financing costs amortization of derivative on the facility agreement interest related to the subordinated convertible notes interest related to the revolving credit facility interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt 
in  we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of million due to the write off of both the embedded derivative and the deferred financing costs related to the repayment of the million convertible notes in september gain on derivative valuation 
derivative valuation was a gain of million in  million in and  in in and  the gain was the result of a decrease in the value of the derivative associated with the facility agreement 
during  the derivative associated with the convertible notes issued in was written off in connection with the repayment of the convertible notes  and the value of the derivative associated with the facility agreement increased  resulting in a net gain of  loss on warrant valuation 
in  we recorded a non cash valuation loss of million  or per common share as compared to a non cash valuation loss of million  or per common share in the change in the valuation of the warrants for the years ended december  and  respectively  were primarily driven by an increase in our stock price and an increase in related volatility 
income taxes 
we generated net taxable income for the year ended december  primarily as a result of temporary differences related to accrued expenses 
we utilized net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits to offset our tax liabilities 
we incurred net operating losses for the years ended december  and and consequently did not pay any federal  state or foreign income taxes 
at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  after utilizing million to offset taxable income in and limiting our net operating loss carryforwards due to previous ownership changes under internal revenue code section we have fully reserved our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty of realization 
our federal tax loss carryforwards will continue to expire in  unless utilized 
our california tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in  unless utilized 
we also have federal and california research tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research tax credits will begin to expire in  unless utilized 
our california research tax credit carryforwards do not expire and will carryforward indefinitely until utilized 
financial outlook we expect our net revenues for will be approximately to million 
as in previous years  our net revenues are seasonal  with first quarter net revenues typically being the lowest of the year and less than the prior quarter 
we expect our gross margin in will be in the range of to of net revenues 
we expect research and development expenses for to be approximately to of net revenues  depending upon the progress of our clinical programs 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses for to be approximately to of net revenues 
we expect our operating income for will be to million 
we expect our net income for will be million to million  or fully diluted earnings per share of to  excluding any mark to market adjustments relating to warrants 
once we are profitable  we expect our fully diluted common shares  including our outstanding shares of common stock  warrants and stock options on a treasury basis  will be approximately million shares 

table of contents we expect our business to have at least million in cash by the end of  which includes repayment of debt of million and reserves for royalties on xibrom and bromday 
excluding the warrant valuation expense  we expect to be our second year of profitability  but due to timing of revenues and expenses  we anticipate a loss in the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and working capital of million 
one third of our million facility agreement is due in september and we anticipate making the million principal repayment out of cash on hand 
historically  we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our debt and equity securities and cash receipts from product sales 
since march  we have received gross proceeds of approximately million from sales of our common stock and the issuance of promissory notes and convertible debt 
under our revolving credit facility with silicon valley bank  we may borrow up to the lesser of million or of eligible accounts receivable  plus the lesser of of net cash or million 
as of december   we had million available under the revolving credit facility of which we borrowed million 
we also had letters of credit of million outstanding 
all outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to the lender s prime rate plus a margin of 
in no event shall the interest rate on outstanding borrowings be less than  which is payable on a monthly basis

the facility agreement also contains customary covenants regarding the operation of our business 
as of december   we are in compliance with all the covenants under the facility agreement 
in connection with the facility agreement  we entered into a security agreement with the lenders  pursuant to which  as security for our repayment obligations under the facility agreement  we granted to the lenders a security interest in certain of our intellectual property  including intellectual property relating to bromday  bepreve  istalol  vitrase  bromday  remura and each other product marketed by or under license from us  and certain personal property relating thereto 

table of contents for the year ended december   we generated million of cash from operations  primarily the result of the increase in royalties payable of million  an increase in accrued expenses of million and other changes in operating assets and liabilities  offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
we incurred a net loss of million  which included loss on warrant valuation million and other non cash charges of million 
non cash charges consisted primarily of stock based compensation costs million  amortization of discount on the facility agreement million  depreciation and amortization million and amortization of deferred financing costs million  offset by a gain on derivative valuation million 
during  we generated million of cash from operations 
the cash generated from operations was primarily the result of a net increase of non cash charges million  change in operating assets and liabilities million  offset by a net loss million 
non cash charges primarily include loss on warrant valuation million  stock based compensation costs million  amortization of discount on the facility agreement million  depreciation and amortization million  amortization of deferred financing costs million and offset by the change in value of the derivative associated with the facility agreement million 
during  we used million of cash for operations primarily as a result of the net loss of million offset by non cash stock based compensation costs million  amortization of deferred financing costs related to the senior subordinated convertible notes million  amortization of deferred financing costs related to the facility agreement million  change in the value of the convertible notes derivative million  change in the value of the facility agreement derivative million  amortization of discount on convertible notes million  amortization of discount on facility agreement million  loss on extinguishment of debt million  depreciation and amortization expense million and a change in operating assets and liabilities million 
for the year ended december   we used cash of million of cash from investing activities  primarily due to our investments in leasehold improvements and purchases of equipment million 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled million in  primarily due to the maturities of our short term investment securities million  offset by the purchase of equipment million 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled million during  primarily attributable to the maturities of short term investments million and the reduction in restricted cash required to secure interest payments on the convertible notes million  offset by the purchase of equipment million 
for the year ended december   we generated million from financing activities  primarily from the issuance of common stock under our espp 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million in  primarily as a result of net repayments on our revolving credit facility million 
cash provided by financing activities in totaled million  which was primarily the result of the issuance of debt under our facility agreement in the principal amount of million  the net borrowings from the revolving credit facility of million  offset by the repayment of our convertible notes of million and debt issuance costs of million 
we believe that current cash and cash equivalents  together with amounts available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility and cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for operating and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  our actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the success of the commercialization of our products  our sales and marketing activities  the expansion of our commercial infrastructure related to our approved products and product candidates  the results of our clinical trials and requirements to conduct additional clinical trials  the introduction of potential generic products  the rate of progress of our research and development programs  the time and expense necessary to obtain regulatory approvals  activities and payments in connection with potential acquisitions of companies  products or technologies  scheduled principal payments on our facility agreement  the outcome of pending litigation  competitive  technological  market and other developments  and our ability to establish and maintain partnering relationships 
these factors may cause us to seek to raise additional funds through additional sales of our debt  or equity or other securities 
there can be no assurance that funds from these sources will be available when needed or  if available  will be on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution or such equity securities may provide for rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 

table of contents we have incurred losses since inception and have never been profitable 
while we currently anticipate becoming profitable in and beyond  we might not be able to achieve profitability or continue to remain profitable 
we have a stockholders deficit of approximately million including non cash valuation warrant adjustments of million through december  we incurred legal expenses in the amount of million  million and million with the law firm  covington burling  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a member of our board of directors is senior counsel in this law firm 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations obligation under capital leases revolving credit facility facility agreement other long term debt obligations total includes million in principal amount of our facility agreement  bearing interest per annum payable quarterly in cash in arrears 
the facility agreement expires september we are required to repay of the original principal amount or million on each of september  and  and of such principal amount outstanding or million on september  in addition to the above  we are committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of our in licensing and development programs 
milestone payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain development  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   the maximum potential future milestone payments to third parties was million  including a milestone of million upon achievement of million cumulative net revenues of bepreve 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
included within these policies are our critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management s most subjective and complex judgment due to the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results of operations and or financial condition 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are as described below 
revenue recognition product revenues 
we recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  when title has passed  the price is fixed or determinable  and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
we recognize product revenues net of estimated allowances for rebates  chargebacks  product returns and other discounts  such as wholesaler fees 
if actual future payments for allowances for discounts  product returns  wholesaler fees  rebates and chargebacks materially exceed the estimates we made at the time of sale  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted 

table of contents we establish allowances for estimated rebates  chargebacks and product returns based on numerous qualitative and quantitative factors  including the number of and specific contractual terms of agreements with customers  estimated level of units in the distribution channel  historical rebates  chargebacks and returns of products  direct communication with customers  anticipated introduction of competitive products or generics  anticipated pricing strategy changes by us and or our competitors  analysis of prescription data gathered by a third party prescription data provider  the impact of wholesaler distribution agreements  the impact of changes in state and federal regulations  and the estimated remaining shelf life of products 
in our analyses  we utilize on hand unit data purchased from the major wholesalers  as well as prescription data purchased from a third party data provider  to develop estimates of historical unit channel pull through 
we utilize an internal analysis to compare historical net product shipments to both estimated historical prescriptions written and historical returns 
based on that analysis  we develop an estimate of the quantity of product which may be subject to various discounts  product returns  rebates  chargebacks and wholesaler fees 
we record estimated allowances for rebates  chargebacks  product returns and other discounts  such as wholesaler fees  in the same period when revenue is recognized 
the objective of recording the allowances for such deductions at the time of sale is to provide a reasonable estimate of the aggregate amount of credit to our direct customers or payments to our indirect customers 
customers typically process their claims for allowances such as early pay discounts promptly  usually within the established payment terms 
we monitor actual credit memos issued to our customers and compare such actual amounts to the estimated provisions  in the aggregate  for each allowance category to assess the reasonableness of the various reserves at each balance sheet date 
differences between our estimated allowances and actual credits issued have not been significant  and are accounted for in the current period as a change in estimate 
in general  we are obligated to accept from our customers the return of products that have reached their expiration date 
we authorize returns for damaged products  expiring and expired products in accordance with our return goods policy and procedures  and have established reserves for such amounts at the time of sale 
we typically refund the agreed proportion of the sales price by the issuance of a credit  rather than cash refund or exchanges for inventory  and the returned product is destroyed 
with the launch of each of our products  we recorded a sales return allowance  which is larger for stocking orders than subsequent re orders 
to date  actual product returns have not exceeded our estimated allowances for returns 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable as of the date when made  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
our financial position  results of operations and cash flows may be materially and negatively impacted if actual returns materially exceed our estimated allowances for returns 
we identify product returns by their manufacturing lot number 
because we manufacture in bulk  lot sizes can be large and  as a result  sales of any individual lot may occur over several periods 
as a result  we are unable to specify if actual returns or credits relate to a sale that occurred in the current period or a prior period  and therefore  we cannot specify how much of the allowance recorded relates to sales made in prior periods 
since there have been no material differences between estimates recorded and actual credits issued  we believe our systems and procedures are adequate for managing our business 
allowances for product returns were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these allowances reflect an estimate of our liability for products that may be returned by the original purchaser in accordance with our stated return policy  which allows customers to return products within six months of their respective expiration dates and for a period up to twelve months after such products have reached their respective expiration dates 
we estimate our liability for product returns at each reporting period based on the estimated units in the channel and the other factors discussed above 
as a percentage of gross product revenues  the allowance for product returns was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in was primarily due to improvements in historical trending of actual returns data  the lengthening of product shelf life and continued acceptance and sale of our products 

table of contents we also periodically offer promotional discounts to our existing customer base 
these discounts are usually calculated as a percentage of the current published list price 
accordingly  the discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period that the program is offered 
in addition to promotional discounts  at the time we implement a price increase  we generally offer our existing customer base an opportunity to purchase a limited quantity of products at the previous list price 
shipments resulting from these programs generally are not in excess of ordinary levels and therefore  we recognize the related revenue upon receipt by the customer and include the sale in estimating our various product related allowances 
in the event we determine that these sales represent purchases of inventory in excess of ordinary levels for a given wholesaler  the potential impact on product returns exposure would be specifically evaluated and reflected as a reduction to revenue at the time of such sale 
allowances for estimated rebates and chargebacks were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
other discounts  such as wholesaler fees and prompt pay discounts  were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these allowances reflect an estimate of our liability for items such as rebates due to various governmental organizations under the medicare medicaid regulations  rebates due to managed care organizations under specific contracts  chargebacks due to various organizations purchasing certain of our products through federal contracts and or group purchasing agreements and fees charged by certain wholesalers under distribution agreements 
we estimate our liability for rebates  chargebacks and other discounts  such as wholesaler fees  at each reporting period based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative assumptions listed above 
as a percentage of gross product revenues  the allowance for rebates  chargebacks and other discounts  such as wholesaler fees  was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to growth in the number and utilization of managed care contracts  federal contracts  and wholesaler distribution agreements and the impact of higher medicaid rebates required under the recently enacted healthcare legislation 
license revenue 
amounts received for product and technology license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of such services or performance if such arrangements require on going services or performance 
amounts received for milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone  unless we have ongoing performance obligations 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
during the year ended december   we recognized million of previously deferred income primarily related to the termination of our supply agreement with otsuka 
we did not receive any similar license revenues in inventory inventories  net of allowances  are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first to expire method 
inventory is reviewed periodically for slow moving or obsolete status 
we adjust our inventory to reflect situations in which the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered 
we would record a reserve to adjust inventory to its net realizable value if i a launch of a new product is delayed  inventory may not be fully utilized and could be subject to impairment  ii when a product is close to expiration and not expected to be sold  iii when a product has reached its expiration date or iv when a product is not expected to be saleable 
in determining the reserves for these products  we consider factors such as the amount of inventory on hand and its remaining shelf life  and current and expected market conditions  including management forecasts and levels of competition 
we have evaluated the current level of inventory considering historical trends and other factors  and based on our evaluation  have recorded adjustments to reflect inventory at its net realizable value 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly from actual results if future economic conditions  customer demand  competition or other relevant factors differ from expectations 
these estimates require us to make assessments about the future demand for our products in order to categorize the status of such inventory items as slow moving  obsolete or in excess of need 
these future estimates are subject to the ongoing accuracy of our forecasts of market conditions  industry trends  competition and other factors 
differences between our estimated reserves and actual inventory adjustments have not been significant  and are accounted for in the current period as a change in estimate 
costs incurred for the manufacture of validation batches for pre approval products are recorded as research and development expenses in the period in which those costs are incurred 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation costs for all stock based awards made to employees and directors 
the fair value of stock based awards is estimated at grant date using an option pricing model and the portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation cost over the requisite service period 

table of contents since stock based compensation is recognized only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest  we have applied an estimated forfeiture rate to unvested awards for the purpose of calculating compensation cost 
these estimates will be revised  if necessary  in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimates 
changes in forfeiture estimates impact compensation cost in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock based awards

income taxes we record a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made

seeking to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities
