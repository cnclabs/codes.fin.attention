item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the comparative summary of selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
historical results and trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations 
our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes  are subject to management evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  retailer performance  changing capital market conditions and other factors which could affect the ongoing viability of our tenants 
executive overview weingarten realty investors is a real estate investment trust reit organized under the texas real estate investment trust act 
effective january   the texas real estate investment trust act was replaced by the texas business organizations code 
we  and our predecessor entity  began the ownership and development of shopping centers and other commercial real estate in our primary business is leasing space to tenants in the shopping and industrial centers we own or lease 
we also manage centers for joint ventures in which we are partners or for other outside owners for which we charge fees 
we operate a portfolio of rental properties which includes neighborhood and community shopping centers and industrial properties of approximately million square feet 
we have a diversified tenant base with our largest tenant comprising only of total rental revenues during our long term strategy is to focus on increasing funds from operations ffo and shareholder value 
we do this through hands on leasing and management  selective redevelopment of the existing portfolio of properties  disciplined growth from strategic acquisitions and new developments and disposition of assets that no longer meet our ownership criteria 
we do this while remaining committed to maintaining a conservatively leveraged balance sheet  a well staggered debt maturity schedule and strong credit agency ratings 

table of contents currently  we are focusing our efforts on improvements to our operating fundamentals and increasing shareholder value 
we have also positioned ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities as the markets continue to improve 
we have implemented a multifaceted approach to utilizing associates from leasing  acquisitions and new development to source these opportunities 
we are also leveraging their efforts with the relationships we have in the brokerage  banking and institutional arenas 
competition for quality acquisition opportunities remains substantial  nevertheless  we have been successful in indentifying selected properties  which meet our return hurdles  and we will continue to actively evaluate other opportunities as they enter the market 
we strive to maintain a strong  conservative capital structure  which provides ready access to a variety of attractive capital sources 
we carefully balance obtaining low cost financing with matching long term liabilities with the acquired or developed long term assets 
while the availability of capital has improved over the past year  there can be no assurance that such pricing and availability will not deteriorate in the near future 
at december   we owned or operated under long term leases  either directly or through our interest in real estate joint ventures or partnerships  a total of developed income producing properties and nine properties under various stages of construction and development 
the total number of centers includes neighborhood and community shopping centers  industrial projects and three other operating properties located in states spanning the country from coast to coast 
we also owned interests in parcels of land held for development that totaled approximately million square feet 
we had approximately  leases with  different tenants at december  leases for our properties range from less than a year for smaller spaces to over years for larger tenants 
rental revenues generally include minimum lease payments  which often increase over the lease term  reimbursements of property operating expenses  including real estate taxes  and additional rent payments based on a percentage of the tenants sales 
the majority of our anchor tenants are supermarkets  value oriented apparel discount stores and other retailers or service providers who generally sell basic necessity type goods and services 
through this challenging economic environment  we believe the stability of our anchor tenants  combined with convenient locations  attractive and well maintained properties  high quality retailers and a strong tenant mix  should ensure the long term success of our merchants and the viability of our portfolio 
in assessing the performance of our properties  management carefully tracks the occupancy of the portfolio 
occupancy for the total portfolio increased from at december  to at december  while we will continue to monitor the economy and the effects on our retailers  we believe the significant diversification of our portfolio  both geographically and by tenant base  and the quality of our portfolio will allow us to maintain occupancy levels at or above these levels as we move through  absent bankruptcies by multiple national or regional tenants 
the weakened economy contributed to a decrease in rental rates on a same space basis as we completed new leases and renewed existing leases 
we completed  new leases or renewals during totaling million square feet  decreasing rental rates an average of on a cash basis 
while we have seen some strengthening on our renewal rates  new lease rates continue to be a challenge 
although we believe the gap in the new lease rate margins will not continue to widen  they are expected to remain a challenge through new development at december   we had nine properties in various stages of development 
we have funded million to date on these projects  and we estimate our investment upon completion to be million  after consideration of anticipated land sales and tax incentive financing which is estimated to be million 
the majority of these properties are slated to be completed over the next three years with an average projected return on investment of approximately when completed 
we have approximately million in land held for development 
due to our analysis of current economic considerations  including the effects of tenant bankruptcies  credit availability to retailers  reduction of tenant expansion plans for new development projects  declines in real estate values and any changes to our plans related to our new development properties  including land held for development  we recorded an impairment charge of million in while we will continue to monitor this market closely  we anticipate minimal investment in land held for development or new projects during 
table of contents acquisitions and joint ventures acquisitions are a key component of our long term strategy 
the availability of quality acquisition opportunities in the market remains sporadic 
competition for the highest quality core properties is intense which has in many cases driven pricing to pre recession highs 
we remain disciplined in approaching these opportunities  pursuing only those that provide appropriate risk adjusted returns 
the use of joint venture arrangements is key to our long term strategy 
partnering with institutional investors through real estate joint ventures enables us to acquire high quality assets in our target markets while also meeting our financial return objectives 
under these arrangements  we benefit from access to lower cost capital  as well as leveraging our expertise to provide fee based services  such as acquisition  leasing  property management and asset management  to the joint ventures 
during  we acquired four retail shopping centers and two industrial properties with two located in texas and one each in arizona  colorado  florida and north carolina for approximately million 
we anticipate to continue to acquire properties through that meet our strategic and pricing objectives 
during the first quarter of  we contributed the final two properties to an unconsolidated real estate joint venture for million  which included loan assumptions of million and the receipt of net proceeds totaling million 
effective april   we assumed control of two owned unconsolidated real estate joint ventures related to a development project in sheridan  colorado that we had previously accounted for under the equity method 
this transaction resulted in the consolidation of these joint ventures  which required us to revalue our investments to fair value  resulting in an impairment loss of million and an increase in net assets of million 
also  in  we acquired a owned unconsolidated real estate joint venture interest in a retail shopping center located in moreno valley  california and a owned unconsolidated real estate joint venture interest in a retail shopping center located in houston  texas for approximately million 
we have a real estate limited partnership agreement with a foreign institutional investor to purchase up to million of retail properties in various states 
our ownership in this unconsolidated real estate limited partnership is 
to date  no properties had been purchased 
we continue to monitor our joint venture relationships and evaluate whether new or existing relationships could provide equity for new investments 
joint venture and outside fee income for and was approximately million and million  respectively 
this fee income is based upon revenues  net income and in some cases appraised property values 
we expect to receive approximately the same amount of fees in dispositions dispositions are also a key component of our ongoing management process where we prune from our portfolio properties that no longer meet our geographic or growth targets 
dispositions provide capital  which may be recycled into properties that have high barrier to entry locations within high growth metropolitan markets  and thus have higher long term growth potential 
over time  we expect this to produce a portfolio with higher occupancy rates and stronger internal revenue growth 
with a continued return of debt financing available to prospective purchasers  we expect to continue to dispose of selected non core properties throughout as opportunities present themselves 

table of contents summary of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition rental revenue is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease  which begins the date the leasehold improvements are substantially complete  if owned by us  or the date the tenant takes control of the space  if the leasehold improvements are owned by the tenant 
revenue from tenant reimbursements of real estate taxes  maintenance expenses and insurance is subject to our interpretation of lease provisions and is recognized in the period the related expense is recognized 
revenue based on a percentage of tenants sales is recognized only after the tenant exceeds their sales breakpoint 
in addition  in circumstances where we would provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant  we would recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
other revenue is income from contractual agreements with third parties  tenants or partially owned real estate joint ventures or partnerships  which is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements 
real estate joint ventures and partnerships to determine the method of accounting for partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships  we apply the guidelines as set forth in gaap 
entities identified as variable interest entities are consolidated if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the partially owned real estate joint venture or partnership 
partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships over which we have a controlling financial interest are consolidated in our financial statements 
in determining if we have a controlling financial interest  we consider factors such as ownership interest  authority to make decisions  kick out rights and substantive participating rights 
management continually analyzes and assesses reconsideration events  including changes in these factors  to determine if the consolidation treatment remains appropriate 
partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships where we do not have a controlling financial interest  but have the ability to exercise significant influence  are accounted for using the equity method 
decisions regarding consolidation of partially owned entities frequently require significant judgment by our management 
errors in the assessment of consolidation could result in material changes to our consolidated financial statements 
property real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method  generally over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and years for parking lot surfacing and equipment 
major replacements where the betterment extends the useful life of the asset are capitalized  and the replaced asset and corresponding accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts 
all other maintenance and repair items are charged to expense as incurred 
if we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 

table of contents acquisitions of properties are accounted for utilizing the acquisition method and  accordingly  the results of operations of an acquired property are included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition 
estimates of fair values are based upon future cash flows and other valuation techniques in accordance with our fair value measurements accounting policy  which are used to record the purchase price of acquired property among land  buildings on an as if vacant basis  tenant improvements  other identifiable intangibles and any goodwill or gain on purchase 
other identifiable intangible assets and liabilities include the effect of out of market leases  the value of having leases in place as is versus as if vacant and absorption costs  out of market assumed mortgages and tenant relationships 
depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight line method  generally over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and over the lease term which includes bargain renewal options for other identifiable intangible assets 
the impact of these estimates  including incorrect estimates in connection with acquisition values and estimated useful lives  could result in significant differences related to the purchased assets  liabilities and resulting depreciation or amortization 
effective  acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
property also includes costs incurred in the development of new operating properties and properties in our merchant development program 
merchant development is a program in which we develop a project with the objective of selling all or part of it  instead of retaining it in our portfolio on a long term basis 
also  disposition of land parcels and non operating properties are included in this program 
these properties are carried at cost  and no depreciation is recorded on these assets until rent commences or no later than one year from the completion of major construction 
these costs include pre acquisition costs directly identifiable with the specific project  development and construction costs  interest and real estate taxes 
indirect development costs  including salaries and benefits  travel and other related costs that are directly attributable to the development of the property  are also capitalized 
the capitalization of such costs ceases at the earlier of one year from the completion of major construction or when the property  or any completed portion  becomes available for occupancy 
the impact of the estimates related to the allocation of indirect costs and interest could result in incorrect estimates in connection with determining the asset value which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
property also includes costs for tenant improvements paid by us  including reimbursements to tenants for improvements that are owned by us and will remain our property after the lease expires 
impairment our property is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the property  including any capitalized costs and any identifiable intangible assets  may not be recoverable 
if such an event occurs  a comparison is made of the current and projected operating cash flows of each such property into the foreseeable future  with consideration of applicable holding periods  on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of such property 
if we determine the carrying amount is not recoverable  our basis in the property is reduced to its estimated fair value to reflect impairment in the value of the asset 
fair values are determined by management utilizing cash flow models  market capitalization and discount rates  or by obtaining third party broker or appraisal estimates in accordance with our fair value measurements accounting policy 
we review current economic considerations each reporting period  including the effects of tenant bankruptcies  the suspension of tenant expansion plans for new development projects  declines in real estate values and any changes to plans related to our new development projects including land held for development  to identify properties where we believe market values may be deteriorating 
determining whether a property is impaired and  if impaired  the amount of write down to fair value requires a significant amount of judgment by management and is based on the best information available to management at the time of evaluation 
the evaluations used in these analyses could result in incorrect estimates when determining carrying values that could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
our investment in partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships is reviewed for impairment each reporting period 
the ultimate realization is dependent on a number of factors  including the performance of each investment and market conditions 
we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment below its carrying amount is other than temporary 
a considerable amount of judgment by our management is used in this evaluation 
our overall future plans for the investment  our investment partner s financial outlook and our views on current market and economic conditions may have a significant impact on the resulting factors analyzed for these purposes 

table of contents fair value measurements certain financial instruments  estimates and transactions are required to be calculated  reported and or recorded at fair value 
the estimated fair values of such financial items  including debt instruments  impairments  acquisitions  investment securities and derivatives  have been determined using a market based measurement 
this measurement is determined based on the assumptions that management believes market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  gaap establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels and of the hierarchy and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level of the hierarchy 
level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices  such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  which is typically based on an entity s own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
the assessed inputs used in determining any fair value measurements could result in incorrect valuations that could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
sales of real estate sales of real estate include the sale of tracts of land within a shopping center development  property adjacent to shopping centers  shopping center properties  merchant development properties  investments in real estate joint ventures and partnerships and partial sales to real estate joint ventures and partnerships in which we participate 
profits on sales of real estate  including merchant development sales are not recognized until a a sale is consummated  b the buyer s initial and continuing investments are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay  c the seller s receivable is not subject to future subordination  and d we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership in the transaction  and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the property 
a considerable amount of judgment by our management is used in this evaluation 
we recognize gains on the sale of real estate to joint ventures and partnerships in which we participate to the extent we receive cash from the joint venture or partnership  if it meets the sales criteria in accordance with gaap  and we do not have a commitment to support the operations of the real estate joint venture or partnership to an extent greater than our proportionate interest in the real estate joint venture or partnership 
accrued rent and accounts receivable receivable balances outstanding include base rents  tenant reimbursements and receivables attributable to the straight lining of rental commitments 
an allowance for the uncollectible portion of accrued rents and accounts receivable is determined based upon an analysis of balances outstanding  historical bad debt levels  tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends 
additionally  estimates of the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims with respect to tenants in bankruptcy are considered in assessing the collectability of the related receivables 
as these factors change  the allowance is subject to revision and may impact our results of operations 
income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income we distribute to our shareholders 
to be taxed as a reit  we must meet a number of requirements including defined percentage tests concerning the amount of our assets and revenues that come from  or are attributable to  real estate operations 
as long as we distribute at least of the taxable income of the reit without regard to capital gains or the dividends paid deduction to our shareholders as dividends  we will not be taxed on the portion of our income we distribute as dividends 

table of contents the tax relief extension act of gave reits the ability to conduct activities which a reit was previously precluded from doing as long as such activities are performed in entities which have elected to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries under the irs code 
these activities include buying or developing properties with the express purpose of selling them 
we conduct certain of these activities in taxable reit subsidiaries that we have created 
we calculate and record income taxes in our consolidated financial statements based on the activities in those entities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between our carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
these are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established for those assets we do not consider the realization of such assets to be more likely than not 
we use estimates in preparing our deferred tax amounts and if revised  these estimates could impact our results of operations 
additionally  gaap prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken  or expected to be taken  in a tax return 
a tax position may only be recognized in the financial statements if we believe it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination 
this evaluation may involve a considerable amount of judgment 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues total revenues were million for the year ended versus million for the year ended  a decrease of million or 
this decrease is attributable to decreases in net rental revenues and other income of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in net rental revenues was primarily attributable to an aggregate million reduction from the sale of an interest in six shopping centers 
offsetting this decline is rentals associated primarily with new development completions and the acquisition of six properties

this decrease resulted from a decrease in net rental revenues of million  which is offset by an increase in other income of million 

table of contents this decrease in net rental revenues resulted primarily from a decline in occupancy  a million decrease associated with the deconsolidation of four joint ventures as of december   and a reduction of million from the sale of an interest in four shopping centers in october the increase in other income resulted primarily from an increase in lease cancellation income from various tenants

the gain on land and merchant development sales of million in resulted primarily from the sale of land parcels plus the realization of a land parcel deferred gain totaling million 
provision benefit for income taxes the increase in the tax provision of million is attributable primarily to our taxable reit subsidiary 
the benefit in associated with impairment losses and the write off of pre development costs was greater compared to the activities in also  in we recorded a valuation allowance of million associated with impairment losses and established a million deferred liability associated with book tax basis differentials 
the valuation allowance was established as the realization of these losses is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the years the related properties are sold 
gain on sale of property the increase in gain on sale of property of million is attributable primarily to the sale of an interest in four shopping centers in october and the disposition of retail buildings at seven operating properties during effects of inflation we have structured our leases in such a way as to remain largely unaffected should significant inflation occur 
most of the leases contain percentage rent provisions whereby we receive increased rentals based on the tenants gross sales 
many leases provide for increasing minimum rentals during the terms of the leases through escalation provisions 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than years  which allow us to adjust rental rates to changing market conditions when the leases expire 
most of our leases also require the tenants to pay their proportionate share of operating expenses and real estate taxes 
as a result of these lease provisions  increases due to inflation  as well as real estate tax rate increases  generally do not have a significant adverse effect upon our operating results as they are absorbed by our tenants 
under the current economic climate  little to no inflation is occurring 
capital resources and liquidity our primary liquidity needs are paying our common and preferred dividends  maintaining and operating our existing properties  paying our debt service costs  excluding debt maturities  and funding capital expenditures 
under our business plan cash flows from operating activities are expected to meet our planned capital needs 

table of contents the primary sources of capital for funding any debt maturities and acquisitions are our revolving credit facility  proceeds from both secured and unsecured debt issuances  proceeds from common and preferred capital issuances  cash generated from the sale of property and the formation of joint ventures  and cash flow generated by our operating properties 
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are retired as needed with proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  common and preferred equity  cash generated from disposition of properties and cash flow generated by our operating properties 
as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under our million revolving credit facility and million was outstanding under our million credit facility  which we use for cash management purposes 
while we have more than adequate capacity under our million revolving credit facility to fund the million of debt maturities including our convertible senior unsecured notes  the capital markets are also available if we choose to issue unsecured debt 
although external market conditions are not within our control  we do not currently foresee any reasons that would prevent us from entering the capital markets 
during july  we established a restricted cash collateral account of million as part of a settlement agreement in connection with a development project in sheridan  colorado  which was replaced with a million letter of credit in november in  we plan to have this letter of credit released upon the remarketing of the underlying bonds 
see contractual obligations for additional information 
our most restrictive debt covenants including debt to assets  secured debt to assets  fixed charge and unencumbered interest coverage and debt yield ratios  limit the amount of additional leverage we can add  however  we believe the sources of capital described above are adequate to execute our business strategy and remain in compliance with our debt covenants 
we have non recourse debt secured by acquired or developed properties held in several of our real estate joint ventures and partnerships 
off balance sheet mortgage debt for our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships totaled million of which our ownership percentage is million at december  scheduled principal mortgage payments on this debt  excluding non cash related items  at are as follows in millions thereafter total we hedge the future cash flows of certain debt transactions  as well as changes in the fair value of our debt instruments  principally through interest rate contracts with major financial institutions 
we generally have the right to sell or otherwise dispose of our assets except in certain cases where we are required to obtain our joint venture partners consent or a third party consent for assets held in special purpose entities  which are owned by us 
investing activities acquisitions and joint ventures retail properties 
during  we contributed the final two properties to an unconsolidated real estate joint venture for million  which included loan assumptions of million and the receipt of net proceeds totaling million

table of contents dispositions retail properties 
during the  we sold a shopping center located in texas and a retail building at two operating properties located in kansas and kentucky 
gross sales proceeds from these dispositions totaled million and generated gains of 
million 
also  two unconsolidated real estate joint ventures each sold a retail building located in california with aggregate gross sales proceeds totaling million

land and merchant development 
during  we sold two land parcels each located in texas with gross sales proceeds of million 
also  two unconsolidated real estate joint ventures each sold a land parcel located in florida with gross sales proceeds totaling million 
new development and capital expenditures at december   we had nine projects under construction with a total square footage of approximately million 
the majority of these properties are slated to be completed over the next three years  and we expect our investment in these properties upon completion to be million  net of proceeds from land sales and tax incentive financing of million 
our new development projects are financed initially under our revolving credit facility  as it is our practice not to use third party construction financing 
management monitors amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and periodically pays down such balances using cash generated from both secured and unsecured debt issuances  from common and preferred share issuances and from dispositions of properties 
capital expenditures for additions to the existing portfolio  acquisitions  new development and our share of investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships totaled million in  million in and million in we have entered into commitments aggregating million comprised principally of construction contracts which are generally due in to months 
financing activities debt total debt outstanding was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
total debt at december  included billion on which interest rates are fixed and million  including the effect of million of interest rate contracts  which bears interest at variable rates 
additionally  debt totaling billion was secured by operating properties while the remaining billion was unsecured 
during july  we established a restricted cash collateral account of million as part of a settlement agreement in connection with a development project in sheridan  colorado  which was replaced with a million letter of credit in november in february  we entered into an amended and restated million unsecured revolving credit facility 
the million unsecured revolving credit facility expires in february and provides borrowing rates that float at a margin over libor plus a facility fee 
the borrowing margin and facility fee are priced off a grid that is tied to our senior unsecured credit ratings  which are currently and basis points  respectively 
the facility also contains a competitive bid feature that will allow us to request bids for up to million 
additionally  an accordion feature allows us to increase the new facility amount up to million 
during  the maximum balance and weighted average balance outstanding under both facilities combined were million and million  respectively  at a weighted average interest rate of 
as of february   no amounts were outstanding under this facility 
effective may  we entered into an agreement with a bank for an unsecured and uncommitted overnight facility totaling million that we intend to maintain for cash management purposes 
the facility provides for fixed interest rate loans at a day libor rate plus a borrowing margin based on market liquidity 
as of february   million was outstanding under this facility 

table of contents the available balance under our revolving credit facility was million at february   which is net of million in outstanding letters of credit  and the available balance under our unsecured and uncommitted overnight facility was million at february  our five most restrictive covenants include debt to assets  secured debt to assets  fixed charge and unencumbered interest coverage and debt yield ratios 
we believe we were in full compliance with all of our covenants as of december  our public debt covenant ratios as defined in our indenture agreement were as follows at december  covenant restriction actual debt to asset ratio less than secured debt to asset ratio less than fixed charge ratio greater than unencumbered asset test greater than in december  we entered into interest rate contracts with a total notional amount of million  which had various maturities through february these contracts were designated as fair value hedges  and we determined that they were highly effective in limiting our risk of changes in the fair value of fixed rate notes attributable to changes in variable interest rates 
in february  we settled million of these interest rate contracts in conjunction with the repurchase of the related unsecured fixed rate medium term notes  and a 
million gain was realized 
in november  the remaining million of these interest rate contracts was settled for million including accrued interest whereby net debt was increased by million  and a gain of 
million was realized 
the increase in net debt is being amortized to net interest expense over the remaining life of the original underlying debt instruments 
in april  we entered into two interest rate contracts with a total notional amount of million that mature in october  which convert fixed interest payments at rates of to variable interest payments 
these contracts were designated as fair value hedges  and we have determined that they are highly effective in limiting our risk of changes in the fair value of fixed rate notes attributable to changes in variable interest rates 
at december   we had four interest rate contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million that were designated as fair value hedges and convert fixed interest payments at rates ranging from to to variable interest payments ranging from 
to we also have two interest rate contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million that were designated as cash flow hedges and fix interest rates at and at december  we have determined that these contracts are highly effective in offsetting future variable interest cash flows 
we could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties  however  management believes such nonperformance is unlikely 
equity common and preferred dividends decreased to million in compared to million in the dividend rate for our common shares of beneficial interest common shares for each quarter of was 
the quarterly dividend rate for our common shares was 
for the first quarter of and 
from the remaining quarters of our dividend payout ratio as calculated as dividends paid on common shares divided by ffo basic for  and approximated  and  respectively 
these ratios are inclusive of the non cash transactions including impairment charges and the loss gain on the redemption of the convertible senior unsecured notes in the respective periods 
subsequent to december   our board of trust managers approved an increase to our quarterly dividend rate to 
per share 
in may  our shareholders approved an amendment to our declaration of trust increasing the number of our authorized common shares  par value per share  from million to million 

table of contents in december  we filed a universal shelf registration which is effective for three years 
we will continue to closely monitor both the debt and equity markets and carefully consider our available financing alternatives  including both public and private placements 
contractual obligations we have debt obligations related to our mortgage loans and unsecured debt  including any draws on our revolving credit facilities 
we have shopping centers that are subject to non cancelable long term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct and or operate a shopping center 
in addition  we have non cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business 
the table below excludes obligations related to our new development projects because such amounts are not fixed or determinable 
we have entered into commitments aggregating million comprised principally of construction contracts which are generally due in to months 
the following table summarizes our primary contractual obligations as of december  in thousands thereafter total mortgages and notes payable unsecured debt secured debt lease payments other obligations total contractual obligations includes principal and interest with interest on variable rate debt calculated using rates at december   excluding the effect of interest rate swaps 
also  excludes a million debt service guaranty liability 
includes our convertible senior unsecured notes that mature in  which have a call put option feature beginning in other obligations include income and real estate tax payments  commitments associated with our secured debt  contributions to our retirement plan and other employee payments 
severance and change in control agreements have not been included as the amounts and payouts are not anticipated 
related to our investment in a development project in sheridan  colorado we  our joint venture partner and the joint venture have each provided a guaranty for the payment of any debt service shortfalls on tax increment revenue bonds issued in connection with the project 
the sheridan redevelopment agency agency issued million of series a bonds used for an urban renewal project 
the bonds are to be repaid with incremental sales and property taxes and a public improvement fee pif to be assessed on current and future retail sales and  to the extent necessary  any amounts we may have to provide under a guaranty 
the incremental taxes and pif are to remain intact until the earlier of the bond liability has been paid in full or unless such date is otherwise extended by the agency 
in july  we settled a lawsuit in connection with the above project 
among the obligations performed or to be performed by us under the terms of the settlement agreement was to cause the joint venture to purchase a portion of the bonds in the amount of million at par  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such purchase 
we established a restricted cash collateral account of million in lieu of a back to back letter of credit previously supporting additional bonds totaling million 
we replaced the restricted cash collateral account with a million letter of credit in november also  in connection with the sheridan  colorado joint venture and the issuance of the related series a bonds  we  our joint venture partner and the joint venture have also provided a performance guaranty on behalf of the agency for the satisfaction of all obligations arising from two interest rate contracts for the combined notional amount of million that matures in december we evaluated and determined that the fair value of the guaranty both at inception and december  was nominal 

table of contents in conjunction with the agency  we are currently working towards bond reissuance alternatives in which the incremental taxes and pif would be extended an additional years 
if we move ahead with the reissuance plan  we would expect the outstanding senior and subordinate bonds to be recalled during the first half of and new senior and subordinate bonds to be reissued 
this transaction could likely result in the receipt of approximately million in cash proceeds and million in new subordinated bonds replacing the face value of our million of senior bonds and million of subordinate bonds  which have been impaired by million at december  furthermore  upon completion of this transaction  we anticipate having to record an additional loss on the new subordinate bonds in a range between million to million based on revised fair value estimates using current market factors and assumptions 
this transaction is dependent on many factors including the agency s ability to reissue the bonds which can not be assured 
we have evaluated the remaining outstanding guaranties and have determined that the fair value of these guaranties is nominal 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   none of our off balance sheet arrangements had a material effect on our liquidity or availability of  or requirement for  our capital resources 
letters of credit totaling million and million were outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december  and  respectively 
we have entered into several unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships 
under many of these agreements  we and our joint venture partners are required to fund operating capital upon shortfalls in working capital 
we have also committed to fund the capital requirements of several new development joint ventures 
as operating manager of most of these entities  we have considered these funding requirements in our business plan 
reconsideration events  including changes in variable interests  could cause us to consolidate these joint ventures and partnerships 
we continuously evaluate these events as we become aware of them 
some triggers to be considered are additional contributions required by each partner and each partner s ability to make those contributions 
under certain of these circumstances  we may purchase our partner s interest 
our material unconsolidated real estate joint ventures are with entities which appear sufficiently stable  however  if market conditions were to continue to deteriorate and our partners are unable to meet their commitments  there is a possibility we may have to consolidate these entities 
if we were to consolidate all of our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures  we would still be in compliance with our debt covenants 
an unconsolidated real estate joint venture was determined to be a variable interest entity vie through the issuance of a secured loan since the lender has the ability to make decisions that could have a significant impact on the success of the entity 
in addition  we have another unconsolidated real estate joint venture with an interest in an entity which is deemed to be a vie since the unconsolidated joint venture provided a guaranty on debt obtained from its investment in a joint venture 
our maximum risk of loss associated with these vies was limited to million at december  we have a real estate limited partnership agreement with a foreign institutional investor to purchase up to million of retail properties in various states 
our ownership in this unconsolidated real estate limited partnership is 
to date  no properties had been purchased 
funds from operations the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and extraordinary items  plus depreciation and amortization of operating properties  including our share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships 
we calculate ffo in a manner consistent with the nareit definition 

table of contents management uses ffo as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using gaap net income by itself as the primary measure of our operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that uses historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself 
there can be no assurance that ffo presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other measurements under gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not reflect working capital changes  cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments on indebtedness 
ffo is calculated as follows in thousands year ended december  net income attributable to common shareholders depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships gain on sale of property loss gain on sale of property of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships funds from operations basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding basic effect of dilutive securities share options and awards weighted average shares outstanding diluted newly issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no 
 disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses  which provides for additional disclosures about the credit quality of an entity s financing receivables  including loans and trade accounts receivables with contractual maturities exceeding one year and any related allowance for losses 
the provisions of this update were effective for us at december   with the exception of disclosures related to activity occurring during a reporting period  which is effective for us in the first quarter of we do not expect the adoption of this update to materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use fixed and floating rate debt to finance our capital requirements 
these transactions expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
derivative financial instruments are used to manage a portion of this risk  primarily interest rate contracts with major financial institutions 
these agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counter parties 
we do not engage in the trading of derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business 
at december   we had fixed rate debt of billion and variable rate debt of million  after adjusting for the net effect of million notional amount of interest rate contracts 
in the event interest rates were to increase basis points and holding all other variables constant  annual net income and cash flows for the following year would decrease by approximately million associated with our variable rate debt  including the effect of the interest rate contracts 
the effect of the basis points increase would decrease the fair value of our variable rate and fixed rate debt by approximately million and million  respectively
