overview and executive summary agilent is the world premier measurement company  providing core electronic and bio analytical measurement solutions to the communications  electronics  life sciences and chemical analysis industries 
our fiscal year end is october unless otherwise stated  all years and dates refer to our fiscal year 
for the year ended october  we acquired three separate businesses a technologies  lab and biocius life sciences inc  for a total cost of million  net of cash acquired 
agilent total orders in were  million  an increase of percent when compared to the increase in orders associated with the varian acquisition less the orders attributable to divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses accounted for percentage points of order growth for the year ended october  when compared to due to the close date of the varian acquisition  which occurred on may   we have excluded orders related to varian for the period november  to may  when we compare periods without the varian acquisition 
the increase in orders in the year ended october  compared with last year was attributable to improvement in many of our instrument platforms  consumables and services 
agilent total orders in increased percent when compared to the increase in orders associated with the varian acquisition less the orders attributable to our divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses accounted for percentage points of order growth for the year ended october  when compared to the increase in orders in the year ended october  compared with the prior year was due to a strong performance in new products and service and support businesses 
agilent net revenue of  million increased percent when compared to the revenue increase associated with the varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to our divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses accounted for approximately percentage points of the revenue increase for the year ended october  when compared to due to the close date of the varian acquisition  which occurred on may   we have excluded revenue related to varian for the period november  to may  when we compare periods without the varian acquisition 

table of contents excluding the varian acquisition and hycor divestiture  growth in demand for life sciences products increased in all markets led by sales into the pharmaceutical and biotechnology end market for the year ended october   when compared to the prior year 
excluding the varian acquisition  sales to all end markets grew across the chemical analysis business  in particular the petrochemical market  for the year ended october  when compared to within electronic measurement  general purpose end markets improved in when compared to the prior year as a result of the recovery in the electronics and semiconductor businesses 
also within electronic measurement  the communications test businesses improved strongly in the year ended october  when compared to the prior year with wireless manufacturing reporting good revenue growth in the year 
agilent total net revenue in increased percent when compared to the revenue increase associated with the varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to our divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses accounted for percentage points of revenue increase for the year ended october  when compared to net income was  million in compared to net income of million in and a net loss of million in in  and we generated operating cash flows of  million  million and million  respectively 
as of october  and we had cash and cash equivalents balances of  million and  million  respectively 
on may   we completed our acquisition of varian by means of a merger of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries with and into varian such that varian became a wholly owned subsidiary of agilent 
we financed the purchase price of varian using the proceeds from our september offering of senior notes and other existing cash 
the varian merger has been accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance and the results of varian are included in agilent consolidated financial statements from the date of merger 
for additional details related to the acquisition of varian  see note  acquisition of varian 
looking forward  we believe there are continued marketing opportunities in emerging markets and improvements to be achieved in operating performance by leveraging our design  supply chain and manufacturing capabilities 
in addition  we will continue integrating varian order fulfillment systems and processes into agilent and our priority is to focus on revenue and cost synergies  as well as increase technology sharing between our businesses 
as a result of the integration of varian into agilent  we are expecting to achieve million in net cost savings 
approximately of the net cost savings have been generated within general and administrative expenses at the end of fiscal and the remaining savings within the costs of products and services are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may be different from the estimates 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
those policies are revenue recognition  inventory valuation  share based compensation  retirement and post retirement plan assumptions  goodwill and purchased intangible assets  restructuring and asset impairment charges and accounting for income taxes 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we enter into agreements to sell products hardware or software  services  and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services 
revenue from product sales  net of trade discounts and allowances  is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
revenue is reduced for estimated product returns  when appropriate 
for sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria  revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met 
for products that include installation  if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element  product revenue is recognized upon delivery  and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete 
otherwise  neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete 
revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer 
we allocate revenue to each element in our multiple element arrangements based upon their relative selling prices 
we determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible product essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met 
the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements 
we use vsoe of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists 
vsoe of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately 
tpe of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers 
as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors  it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing necessary to establish tpe 
esp represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis 
we determine esp for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including  but not limited to customer type  geography  market conditions  competitive landscape  gross margin objectives and pricing practices 
the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by management 
we may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future 
as these pricing strategies evolve  we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which may result in changes in esp 
the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements from the current fiscal quarter  which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement 
inventory valuation 
we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage 
such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions 
the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge 
our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts  managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold to customers  resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

table of contents share based compensation 
we account for share based awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
under the authoritative guidance  share based compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value and is recognized on a straight line basis 
the fair value of share based awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
shares granted under the ltpp were valued using the monte carlo simulation model 
the estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards is determined based on the market price of agilent common stock on the date of grant 
the espp allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at percent of the purchase price and uses the purchase date to establish the fair market value 
both the black scholes and monte carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions  including the option expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the historical volatility of agilent stock option over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life 
a percent increase in our estimated volatility from percent to percent for our most recent employee stock option grant would generally increase the value of an award and the associated compensation cost by approximately percent if no other factors were changed 
in and the expected life of our employee stock options was years 
in the first quarter of  we revised our estimate of the expected life of our employee stock options from to years 
for the grants awarded under the stock plan after november   we increased the period available to retirement eligible employees to exercise their options from three years at retirement date to the full contractual term of ten years 
in developing our estimated life of our employee stock options of years  we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our executive employees who were granted the majority of the options in the annual grants made during the three months ended january   which we believe is representative of future behavior 
see note  share based compensation  to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan assumptions 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business 
they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions 
to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations  we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long term return on plan assets 
other important assumptions include  expected future salary increases  expected future increases to benefit payments  expected retirement dates  employee turnover  retiree mortality rates  and portfolio composition 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date october for both us and us plans 
for and  the us discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio and decreased in from the previous year 
in  the discount rate for non us plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate 
table of contents bonds and either remained unchanged or decreased 
lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense  higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense 
the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented 
for us plans  gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime 
for most non us plans and non us post retirement benefit plans  gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year gains and losses 
the expected long term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns 
plan assets are valued at fair value 
if we changed our estimated return on assets by percent  the impact would be million on us pension expense and million on us pension expense 
the net periodic pension and post retirement benefit costs recorded in operations excluding curtailments and settlements were million in  million in  and million in goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
agilent reviews goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as defined in the authoritative guidance  a reporting unit is an operating segment  or one level below an operating segment 
we have aggregated components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units 
we have three reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes life sciences  chemical analysis and electronic measurement 
at the time of an acquisition  we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination 
in september  the fasb approved changes to the goodwill impairment guidance which are intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual impairment test 
the changes provide entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
the revised standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the current two step test is necessary 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not ie chance that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test will be required 
otherwise  no further testing will be required 
the revised guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit fair value is less than its carrying amount 
these include macro economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity operating environment or industry or market considerations  entity specific events such as increasing costs  declining financial performance  or loss of key personnel  or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers 
the new qualitative indicators replace those currently used to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is required 
the changes will be effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  however  earlier adoption is permitted 
agilent has opted to early adopt this guidance for the year ended october  if it is determined  as a result of the qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
the second step if necessary measures the amount 
table of contents of impairment by applying fair value based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 
based on our results of our qualitative test for goodwill impairment  as of september   we believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our three reporting units  life sciences  chemical analysis and electronic measurement  is greater than their respective carrying values 
there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october   and each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated 
purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies  proprietary know how  trademarks  and customer relationships and are amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from months to years 
in process research and development ipr d is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter 
when the ipr d project is complete  it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life 
if an ipr d project is abandoned  agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to agilent consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned 
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets  including purchased intangible assets  may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
we performed impairment analyses of purchased intangible assets in and recorded million of impairment charges primarily related to a business where we ceased operations 
we performed impairment analyses of purchased intangible assets in and recorded million of impairment charges primarily related to a divested business 
restructuring and asset impairment charges 
the four main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions  the consolidation of excess facilities  asset impairments and special charges related to inventory 
workforce reduction charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred  which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments 
plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges  net of estimated future sublease income 
we recognize charges for consolidation of excess facilities generally when we have vacated the premises 
these estimates were derived using the authoritative accounting guidance 
we have also assessed the recoverability of our long lived assets  by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows 
asset impairments primarily consist of property  plant and equipment and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment net of costs to sell 
the charges related to inventory include estimated future inventory disposal payments that we are contractually obliged to make to our suppliers and reserves taken against inventory on hand 
if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated  the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different  either higher or lower  than those we have recorded 
accounting for income taxes 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the 
table of contents calculation of tax credits  benefits and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized 
we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
we consider evidence such as our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 
at october   we provided a valuation allowance for our net us deferred tax assets and on certain foreign deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
due to improvements in the us operating results over the past three years  management believes a reasonable possibility exists that  within the next year  sufficient positive evidence may become available to reach a conclusion that the us valuation allowance will no longer be needed 
we have not provided for all us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely 
should we decide to remit this income to the us in a future period  our provision for income taxes will increase materially in that period 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model  the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management 
if the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties is different from what is currently estimated  a material impact on income tax expense could result 
adoption of new pronouncements see note  new accounting pronouncements  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements 
restructuring costs  asset impairments and other charges our restructuring program  the fy plan  announced in the first half of  was conceived in response to deteriorating economic conditions and was designed to deliver sufficient savings to enable our businesses to reach their profitability targets throughout the cycle 
workforce reduction payments  primarily severance  were largely complete in fiscal year lease payments should primarily be complete by the end of fiscal foreign currency our revenues  costs and expenses  and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities 
we hedge revenues  expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies 
table of contents of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis 
we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues  expenses  monetary assets and liabilities 
our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short term basis rolling twelve month period 
therefore  we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term

gross inventory charges were million in and and million in sales of previously written down inventory were million in and and million in our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies  none of which is individually significant to our operations 
we conduct five types of research and development basic research  foundation technologies  communications  life sciences and measurement 
our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in electronics  software  systems and solutions  life sciences and photonics 
in each of these research fields  we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time horizon 
some of our product development research is designed to improve on the more than  products already in production  focus on major new product releases  and develop new product segments for the future 
due to the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses  there are a number of drivers of this expense 
we remain committed to invest about percent of revenues in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share

provision for income taxes years ended october  in millions provision for income taxes agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions  most significantly in singapore  and malaysia 
the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions 
the tax holidays are due for renewal between and as a result of the incentives  the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the benefit of the tax holidays on net income loss per share diluted was approximately  and in  and  respectively 
for  the effective tax rate was percent 
the percent effective tax rate reflects tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates and includes a million net tax benefit primarily associated with a refund in canada and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and the reversal of the related interest accruals due to the reassessment of certain uncertain tax positions 
the income tax provision also includes a million out of period adjustment to reduce the carrying value of certain uk deferred tax assets for which the majority was recorded in the quarter ended april  the overstatement of these deferred tax assets resulted in an overstatement of the uk valuation allowance release in the fourth quarter of for the full year  this out of period adjustment was substantially offset by other out of period adjustments 
the net impact of all out of period adjustments on the effective tax rate was immaterial 
without considering interest and penalties  the effective rate reflects taxes in all jurisdictions except the us and certain foreign jurisdictions in which income tax expense or benefit continues to be offset by adjustments to valuation allowances 
we intend to maintain valuation allowances in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
for  the effective tax rate was percent 
the percent effective tax rate includes a million beneficial release of the uk valuation allowance  a million current year increase in prior year tax reserves  and tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates 
also included is a million tax benefit related to a million non taxable settlement payment received in connection with a tax sharing agreement between agilent and hewlett packard company 
without considering interest and penalties  the effective rate reflects taxes in all jurisdictions except the us and certain foreign jurisdictions in which income tax expense or benefit continues to be offset by adjustments to valuation allowances 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
for  the effective tax rate was percent 
the percent effective tax rate reflects that our structure has a fixed component that results in unusual tax results on reduced levels of profitability 
the tax rate also includes tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates 
in addition  net tax benefits totaling million relating primarily to the lapses of statutes of limitations and tax settlements in foreign jurisdictions are incorporated in the rate 
without considering interest and penalties  the rate reflects taxes in all jurisdictions except the us and foreign jurisdictions where we have recorded valuation allowances 

table of contents during  we established a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets of the us and certain entities in foreign jurisdictions 
the valuation allowance requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
during   and  we continued to maintain valuation allowance for us federal and state deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
we currently have a valuation allowance of million of which million relates to us jurisdictions 
the reduction to the valuation allowance in is primarily due to the reduction in the deferred taxes relating to pension and post retirement medical benefits and the utilization of tax credits associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings 
due to improvements in the us operating results over the past three years  management believes a reasonable possibility exists that  within the next year  sufficient positive evidence may become available to reach a conclusion that the us valuation allowance will no longer be needed 
in after consideration of all the available positive and negative evidence  we concluded that it is more likely than not that all of the uk deferred tax assets will be realized and reversed the entire uk valuation allowance 
in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  for all us and other tax jurisdictions  we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would be required 
if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 
on august  we reached an agreement with the internal revenue service irs for tax years through the adjustments were offset by applying available net operating losses and had no material impact on our statement of operations 
in december  we reached an agreement with the irs for tax years in addition  agilent and the irs reached an agreement on transfer pricing issues covering years tax adjustments resulting from these agreements will be offset with net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
agilent us federal income tax returns for through are currently under audit by the irs 
primarily as a result of these agreements with the irs and agreements with other tax jurisdictions  unrecognized tax benefits were reduced from million at october  to million at october  segment overview agilent is a measurement company providing core bio analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the life sciences  chemical analysis  communications and electronics industries

the share repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
there is no fixed termination date for the new share repurchase program

the notes were issued at of their principal amount  bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum  and mature on september  interest is payable semi annually on march th and september th of each year  and payments commenced on march  upon the closing of the offering of the senior notes  we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million 
under the interest rate swaps  we will receive fixed rate interest payments and will make payments based on the us dollar libor plus basis points with respect to the senior notes 
the economic effect of these swaps will be to convert the fixed rate interest expense on the senior notes to a variable libor based interest rate 
the hedging relationship qualifies for the shortcut method of assessing hedge effectiveness  and consequently we do not expect any ineffectiveness during the life of the swap and any movement in the value of the swap would be reflected in the movement in fair value of the senior notes 
at october   the fair value of the swaps on senior notes was an asset of million  with a corresponding increase in the carrying value of senior notes

off balance sheet arrangements and other we have contractual commitments for non cancelable operating leases 
see note commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non cancelable operating leases 
our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets 
our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world 
local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances 
we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

table of contents contractual commitments our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  inventory management  and the timing of tax and other payments 
as a result  the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 
the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october  for operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in millions less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating leases commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers other purchase commitments retirement plans total operating leases 
commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property  see note  commitments and contingencies 
commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers 
we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates 
however  our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel  reschedule  and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within days are non cancelable 
therefore  only approximately percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  non cancelable  and unconditional commitments 
we expect to fulfill almost all purchase commitments for inventory within one year 
in addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers  we record a liability for firm  non cancelable  and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory 
as of october   the liability for our firm  non cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was million  compared to million as of october  these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
other purchase commitments 
we have categorized other purchase commitments as contracts with professional services suppliers 
typically we can cancel these contracts within days without penalties 
for those contracts that are not cancelable within days without penalties  we are disclosing the amounts we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contract in that period before such contract can be cancelled 
our contractual obligations with these suppliers under other purchase commitments were approximately million for the next year 
retirement plans 
commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our us and non us defined benefit plans and to our post retirement medical plans 

table of contents we had no material off balance sheet arrangements as of october  or october  on balance sheet arrangements the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations recorded in our consolidated balance sheet pertaining to our short term and long term debt as of october  in millions less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years senior notes we have contractual obligations for interest payments on the above debts 
interest rates and payment dates are detailed in net cash provided by used in financing activities 
other long term liabilities include million and million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of october  and october   respectively 
we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries 
we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance 
our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise wide basis 
this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments  including option and forward contracts  to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them 
we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
our operations generate non functional currency cash flows such as revenues  third party vendor payments and inter company payments 
in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market  we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk 
approximately percent of our revenues in  percent of our revenues in and percent of our revenues in were generated in us dollars 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of october  and  the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash  cash equivalents and other short term investments 
we have issued long term debt in us dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing 
we believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change  and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk 
the interest rate swaps effectively change our fixed interest rate payments to us dollar libor based variable interest expense to match the floating interest income from our cash  cash equivalents and other short term investments 
by entering into these interest rate swaps we are also hedging the movements in the fair value of the fixed rate debt on our balance sheet 
however  not all of our fixed rate debt fair value is hedged in this manner  and in the future we may choose to terminate previously executed swaps 
as of october  we held interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million associated with our senior notes 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt 
as of october   the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt
