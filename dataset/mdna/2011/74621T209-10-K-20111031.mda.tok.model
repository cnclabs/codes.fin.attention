we also manufacture and sell various sdc based formulations to manufacturers for use as a raw material in the production of personal care and other products 
we believe our technology platform has potential application in a number of industries  and we have ongoing research and development projects in food processing  agriculture  water treatment  pharmaceuticals  and oil and gas 
our goal is to become a sustainable company by using our proprietary technology platform to deliver leading antimicrobial products to multiple industries 
we manufacture and sell sdc based products for end use  and as a raw material for manufacturing use 
our current products are as follows product name product use epa registration pure hard surface disinfectant and sanitizer sdca axen disinfectant axen silv rion raw material not applicable axenohl raw material axenohl pure hard surface pure hard surface is our patented and epa registered hard surface disinfectant and food contact surface sanitizer 
we manufacture both consumer and commercial versions of the product 
pure hard surface combines high efficacy and low toxicity with second bacterial and viral kill times and hour residual protection 
the product completely kills resistant pathogens such as mrsa and carbapenem resistant klebsiella pneumoniae ndm  and effectively eliminates dangerous fungi and viruses including hiv  hepatitis b  hepatitis c  norovirus  influenza a  avian influenza and hn it also eradicates hazardous food pathogens such as e 
coli  salmonella  campylobacter and listeria 
pure hard surface delivers broad spectrum efficacy yet remains classified as least toxic by the epa 
the active ingredient  sdc  has been designated as generally recognized as safe  or gras  for use on food processing equipment  machinery and utensils 
axen axen is our patented and epa registered hard surface disinfectant and is a predecessor product to pure hard surface 
axen is sold by distributors under the private label brands spectrasan  puregreen  critical care  mother nature s choice  ag ainst and iv in prior years  we sold this product to other distributors that resold axen under a variety of other private label brands 
silv rion silv rion is our patented antimicrobial formulation for use as a raw material in the manufacturing of personal care products 
it can be used as either an active ingredient or a preservative 
silv rion is a colorless  odorless and stable solution that provides ionic silver in a water soluble form 
it provides fast acting efficacy at low concentrations against a broad spectrum of bacteria  viruses  yeast and molds 
axenohl axenohl is our patented and epa registered antimicrobial formulation for use as a raw material in the manufacturing of epa registered products 
axenohl is a colorless  odorless and stable solution that provides fast acting efficacy against bacteria  viruses and fungi when manufactured into consumer and commercial disinfecting and sanitizing products 
we were incorporated in the state of california in august as innovative medical services 
in september  we changed our name to pure bioscience 
in march  we reincorporated in the state of delaware under the name pure bioscience  inc we operate in one business segment 
recent developments we recently received a notice from richmont corporation  or richmont  announcing its intended nomination of six individuals for election to our board of directors at our annual meeting 
in the notice  richmont confirmed its ownership of shares of our common stock  which represents less than one half of one percent of our outstanding common stock 
if a proxy contest results from these actions by richmont  our business could be adversely affected 
responding to proxy contests and other actions by insurgent stockholders can be costly and time consuming  disrupting operations and diverting the attention of management and employees 
perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may impact our existing and potential collaborations or strategic relationships and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel 
if individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda  it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan 
financial overview this financial overview provides a general description of our revenue and expenses 
revenue we manufacture and sell sdc based products for end use  and as a raw material for manufacturing use 
we also license our products and technology to development and commercialization partners 
revenue is recognized when realized or realizable and earned 
any amounts received prior to satisfying revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold for product sales includes direct and indirect costs to manufacture products  including materials consumed  manufacturing overhead  shipping costs  salaries  benefits and related expenses of operations 
depreciation related to manufacturing is systematically allocated to inventory produced  and expensed through cost of goods sold at the time inventory is sold 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in business development  sales  finance  accounting  information technology  and executive functions 
other selling  general and administrative costs include product marketing  advertising  and trade show costs  as well as public relations and investor relations  facility costs  and legal  accounting and other professional fees

research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs  product registration expenses  and third party testing 
we expense research and developments costs as incurred 
other income expense other income expense consists of interest income and interest expense  as well as other non operating transactions 
results of operations comparison of the years ended july  and net product sales net product sales were  and  for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the decrease of  was primarily attributable to lower sales to five customers 
specifically  these five customers accounted for  of net product sales for the year ended july   but only  for the year ended july for the year ended july   one customer accounted for of our net product sales 
no other individual customer accounted for or more of our net product sales 
the geographic breakdown of net product sales is as follows us and foreign 
for the year ended july   one customer accounted for of our net product sales 
no other individual customer accounted for or more of our net product sales 
the geographic breakdown of net product sales is as follows us and foreign 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was  and  for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the decrease of  was attributable to decreased net product sales 
gross margin as a percent of net product sales  or gross margin percentage  was and for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the sale of higher margin formulations and packaging configurations of our products during the year ended july  as compared to prior year 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense was  and  for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the increase of  was primarily attributable to increases in marketing and trade show activity  personnel and related costs  and consulting services  as well as professional fees and costs associated with our reincorporation in the state of delaware 
research and development expense research and development expense was  and  for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the increase of  in the year ended july  was primarily attributable to increases in product registration expenses and personnel and related costs  partially offset by decreases in consulting services and laboratory costs and supplies 
impairment of capitalized assets there were no impairments of capitalized assets for the year ended july  for the year ended july   we wrote off  of equipment related to a manufacturing development project that was deemed unfeasible 
this amount was recorded as an impairment of capitalized assets on our consolidated statements of operations 
other income  net other income  net was  and  for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the decrease of  was primarily attributable to a legal settlement of  that we received in the year ended july  liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations through public and private offerings of securities  revenue from product sales and license agreements  proceeds from the sale of a division and interest income from invested cash balances 
we have a history of recurring losses  and we have incurred a cumulative net loss of  during the year ended july   we received  from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options 
we also received  from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of warrants 
in april  we entered into a sales agreement with an investment banking firm 
under the terms of the sales agreement  we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to  the sales are made  from time to time  through the investment bank in at the market offerings  as defined by the sec  and are pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement previously filed with the sec 
during the year ended july   we sold  shares of our common stock pursuant to these offerings  for net proceeds of  as of july   we had  remaining on our shelf registration 
while future sales of our common stock are not guaranteed  and there are no firm commitments to receive funding under the sales agreement  based on net proceeds received through the date of this report and the historical trading volumes and market prices of our common stock  we believe we may  if desirable  be successful in selling shares of our common stock that will enable us to secure the capital remaining under the sales agreement 
in october  we completed a private placement of  newly issued unregistered shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the net proceeds from the private placement were  during the year ended july   we received  from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options 
we also received  from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of warrants 
in september  we completed a registered direct offering of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
each share of common stock was sold at a price of per share  and investors received warrants to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share for each share of common stock purchased in the offering 
the net proceeds from this offering were  as of july   we had  in cash and cash equivalents  and  in accounts receivable  compared to  in cash and cash equivalents  and  in accounts receivable as of july  the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to the use of cash to fund our operations  partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock through securities offerings  the exercise of stock options and the exercise of warrants 
the decrease in accounts receivable was attributable to lower sales for the year ended july  as compared to prior year 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of july payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations total in addition  from time to time we have entered into employment agreements with our executives that  under certain cases  provide for the continuation of salary and certain other benefits if these executives are terminated under specified circumstances 
these agreements generally expire upon termination for cause or when we have met our obligations under these agreements 
as of july   no events have occurred resulting in the obligation of any such payments 
our future capital requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors may include  but are not limited to  the following the acceptance of  and demand for  our products  our success and the success of our partners in selling our products  our success and the success of our partners in obtaining regulatory approvals to sell our products  the costs of further developing our existing products and technologies  the extent to which we invest in new product and technology development  and the costs associated with the continued operation  and any future growth  of our business 
the outcome of these and other forward looking factors will substantially affect our liquidity and capital resources 
we expect that we will need to increase our liquidity and capital resources by one or more measures 
these measures may include  but are not limited to  the following reducing operating expenses  obtaining financing through the issuance of equity  debt  or convertible securities  entering into partnerships  licenses  or other arrangements with third parties  and reducing the exercise price of outstanding warrants 
any one of these measures could substantially reduce the value to us of our technology and its commercial potential 
if we issue equity  debt or convertible securities to raise additional funds  our existing stockholders may experience dilution  and the new equity  debt or convertible securities may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders 
there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain capital on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital  it would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
it could cause us to fail to execute our business plan  fail to take advantage of future opportunities  or fail to respond to competitive pressures or customer requirements 
it also may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs  to license to third parties the right to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise commercialize ourselves  or to reduce or cease operations 
if adequate funds are not available when needed  we may be required to significantly modify our business model and operations to reduce spending to a sustainable level 
we believe our current efforts to raise capital  our current efforts to market and sell our products  and our ability to significantly reduce expenses  will provide sufficient cash resources to satisfy our needs over the next months 
however  we do not yet have  and we may never have  significant cash inflows from product sales or from other sources of revenue to offset our ongoing and planned investments in corporate infrastructure  research and development projects  regulatory submissions  business development activities  and sales and marketing  among other investments 
some or all of our ongoing or planned investments may not be successful 
in addition  irrespective of our cash resources  we may be contractually or legally obligated to make certain investments which cannot be postponed 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to aid you in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition we sell our products to distributors and end users 
we record revenue when we sell products to our customers  rather than when our customers resell products to third parties 
when we sell products to our customers  we reduce the balance of our inventory with a corresponding charge to cost of goods sold 
we do not currently have any consignment sales 
product sales are recognized when delivery of the products has occurred  title has passed to the customer  the selling price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and we have no further obligations 
any amounts received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
we record product sales net of discounts at the time of sale and report product sales net of such discounts 
we also license our products and technology to development and commercialization partners 
license fee revenue consists of product and technology license fees earned 
upfront product and technology license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of such services or performance  if such arrangements require on going services or performance 
non refundable amounts received for substantive milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone 
any amounts received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
share based compensation we grant equity based awards under share based compensation plans 
we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards using the black scholes option valuation model 
this fair value is then amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including price volatility of the underlying stock  risk free interest rate  dividend yield  and expected life of the option 
share based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  and therefore is reduced by expected forfeitures 
changes in assumptions used under the black scholes option valuation model could materially affect our net loss and net loss per share 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with gaap  if indicators of impairment exist  we assess the recoverability of the affected long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the fair value of the asset and we record the impairment as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating results 
estimating the undiscounted future cash flows associated with long lived assets requires judgment  and assumptions could differ materially from actual results 
for purposes of testing impairment  we group our long lived assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups 
currently  there is only one level of aggregation for our intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  consisting of property  plant  and equipment and our patent portfolio  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or circumstances include an asset group s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  loss of legal ownership or title to an asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset s  and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
additionally  on a quarterly basis we review the significant assumptions underlying our impairment assessment to determine that our previous conclusions remain valid 
recoverability of assets to be held and used in operations is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
the factors used to evaluate the future net cash flows  while reasonable  require a high degree of judgment and the results could vary if the actual results are materially different than the forecasts 
in addition  we base useful lives and amortization or depreciation expense on our subjective estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenue or otherwise be used by us 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
we also periodically review the lives assigned to our intangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which we expect to realize cash flows from the technologies 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase
