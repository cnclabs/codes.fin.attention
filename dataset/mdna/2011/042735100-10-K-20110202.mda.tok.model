critical accounting policies and estimates the company consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

the company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services are rendered  the sales price is determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue typically is recognized at time of shipment 
sales are recorded net of discounts  rebates  and returns  which historically have not been material 
a portion of the company business involves shipments directly from its suppliers to its customers 
in these transactions  the company is responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and customer  payment to the supplier  establishing payment terms with the customer  product returns  and has risk of loss if the customer does not make payment 
as the principal with the customer  the company recognizes the sale and cost of sale of the product upon receiving notification from the supplier that the product was shipped 
the company has certain business with select customers and suppliers that is accounted for on an agency basis that is  the company recognizes the fees associated with serving as an agent in sales with no associated cost of sales in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic generally  these transactions relate to the sale of supplier service contracts to customers where the company has no future obligation to perform under these contracts or the rendering of logistics services for the delivery of inventory for which the company does not assume the risks and rewards of ownership

the allowances for doubtful accounts are determined using a combination of factors  including the length of time the receivables are outstanding  the current business environment  and historical experience 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
write downs of inventories to market value are based upon contractual provisions governing price protection  stock rotation  and obsolescence  as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the company  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
due to the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the book cost of inventories 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
investments the company accounts for available for sale investments at fair value  using quoted market prices  and the related holding gains and losses are included in other in the shareholders equity section in the company consolidated balance sheets 
the company assesses its long term investments accounted for as available for sale on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in market value below cost are other than temporary 
when the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the cost basis for the individual security is reduced and a loss is realized in the company consolidated statement of operations in the period in which it occurs 
the company makes such determination based upon the quoted market price  financial condition  operating results of the investee  and the company intent and ability to retain the investment over a period of time  which is sufficient to allow for any recovery in market value 
in addition  the company assesses the following factors broad economic factors impacting the investee industry  publicly available forecasts for sales and earnings growth for the industry and investee  and the cyclical nature of the investee industry 
during  the company determined that an other than temporary decline in the fair value of its investment in marubun corporation occurred and  accordingly  recognized a loss of million 
per share on both a basic and diluted basis on the write down of this investment 
the company could incur an additional impairment charge in future periods if  among other factors  the investee future earnings differ from currently available forecasts 
income taxes the carrying value of the company deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
should the company determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance to the deferred tax assets would be established in the period such determination was made 
it is the company policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
at december   the company believes it has appropriately accounted for any unrecognized tax benefits 
to the extent the company prevails in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability  the company effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected 
financial instruments the company uses various financial instruments  including derivative financial instruments  for purposes other than trading 
derivatives used as part of the company risk management strategy are designated at inception as hedges and measured for effectiveness both at inception and on an ongoing basis 
the company enters into interest rate swap transactions that convert certain fixed rate debt to variable rate debt or variable rate debt to fixed rate debt in order to manage its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
the effective portion of the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges is recorded as a change to the carrying value of the related hedged debt  and the effective portion of the change in fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in the shareholders equity section in the company consolidated balance sheets in other 
the ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps  if any  is recorded in interest and other financing expense  net in the company consolidated statements of operations 
the company occasionally enters into cross currency swaps to hedge a portion of its net investment in euro denominated net assets 
the company s cross currency swaps are derivatives designated as net investment hedges 
the effective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as net investment hedges is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment included in the company consolidated balance sheets and any ineffective portion is recorded in interest and other financing expense  net in the company consolidated statements of operations 
the company uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess the effectiveness of its net investment hedge on a quarterly basis 
contingencies and litigation the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits  and other claims related to environmental  regulatory  labor  product  tax  and other matters and assesses the likelihood of an adverse judgment or outcome for these matters  as well as the range of potential losses 
a determination of the reserves required  if any  is made after careful analysis 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments impacting the probability of a loss  the estimate of such loss  and the probability of recovery of such loss from third parties 
restructuring and integration the company recorded charges in connection with restructuring its businesses  and the integration of acquired businesses 
these items primarily include employee separation costs and estimates related to the consolidation of facilities net of sub lease income  contractual obligations  and the impairment of certain assets 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
stock based compensation the company records share based payment awards exchanged for employee services at fair value on the date of grant and expenses the awards in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite employee service period 
stock based compensation expense includes an estimate for forfeitures and is generally recognized over the vesting period of the award on a straight line basis 
stock based compensation expense related to awards with a market or performance condition is generally recognized over the vesting period of the award utilizing the graded vesting method 
the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model and the assumptions shown in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management best estimates 
the company estimates may be impacted by certain variables including  but not limited to  stock price volatility  employee stock option exercise behaviors  additional stock option grants  estimates of forfeitures  the company performance  and related tax impacts 
employee benefit plans the costs and obligations of the company defined benefit pension plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions 
the two critical assumptions used  which impact the net periodic pension cost income and the benefit obligation  are the discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
the discount rate represents the market rate for a high quality corporate bond  and the expected return on plan assets is based on current and expected asset allocations  historical trends  and expected returns on plan assets 
these key assumptions are evaluated annually 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts 
costs in excess of net assets of companies acquired goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the assets acquired 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist  such as i a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  ii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  iii unanticipated competition  iv a loss of key personnel  v a more likely than not sale or disposal of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit  vi the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  or vii the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss of a subsidiary that is a component of the reporting unit 
in addition  goodwill is required to be tested for impairment after a portion of the goodwill is allocated to a business targeted for disposal 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test requires the identification of the reporting units and comparison of the fair value of each of these reporting units to the respective carrying value 
the company reporting units are defined as each of the three regional businesses within the global components business segment  which are the americas  emea  and asia pacific and each of the two regional businesses within the global ecs business segment  which are north america and emea 
prior to  the north america and emea reporting units within the global ecs business segment were evaluated as a single reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is less than its fair value  no impairment exists and the second step is not performed 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  the second step must be performed to compute the amount of the goodwill impairment  if any 
in the second step  the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized for the excess 
the company generally estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using a three year weighted average multiple of earnings before interest and taxes from comparable companies  which utilizes a look back approach 
the assumptions utilized in the evaluation of the impairment of goodwill under this approach include the identification of reporting units and the selection of comparable companies  which are critical accounting estimates subject to change 
beginning in  as a result of significant declines in macroeconomic conditions  the company determined that it was prudent to also supplement its historical goodwill impairment testing methodology with a forward looking discounted cash flow methodology 
the assumptions included in the discounted cash flow methodology included forecasted revenues  gross profit margins  operating income margins  working capital cash flow  perpetual growth rates  and long term discount rates  among others  all of which require significant judgments by management 
the company also reconciles its discounted cash flow analysis to its current market capitalization allowing for a reasonable control premium 
as of the first day of the fourth quarters of   and  the company annual impairment testing did not indicate impairment at any of the company reporting units 
during the fourth quarter of  as a result of significant declines in macroeconomic conditions  global equity valuations depreciated 
both factors impacted the company market capitalization  and the company determined it was necessary to perform an interim goodwill impairment test as of december  based upon the results of the discounted cash flow approach as of december   the carrying value of the global ecs reporting unit and the emea and asia pacific reporting units within the global components business segment were higher than their fair value and  accordingly  the company performed a step two impairment analysis 
the fair value of the americas reporting unit within the global components business segment was higher than its carrying value and a step two analysis was not required 
the results of the step two impairment analysis indicated that goodwill related to the emea and asia pacific reporting units within the global components business segment were fully impaired and the goodwill related to the global ecs business segment was partially impaired 
the company recognized a total non cash impairment charge of billion million net of related taxes or per share on both a basic and diluted basis as of december   of which million related to the company global components business segment and million related to the company global ecs business segment 
the impairment charge did not impact the company s consolidated cash flows  liquidity  capital resources  and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility  asset securitization program  and other outstanding borrowings 
a decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations  could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of the company businesses and the company could be required to record an additional impairment charge in the future  which could impact the company s consolidated balance sheet  as well as the company s consolidated statement of operations 
if the company was required to recognize an additional impairment charge in the future  the charge would not impact the company s consolidated cash flows  current liquidity  capital resources  and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility  asset securitization program  and other outstanding borrowings 
as of december   the company has billion of goodwill  of which approximately million was allocated to the americas reporting unit within the global components business segment and million and million was allocated to the north america and emea reporting units within the global ecs business segment  respectively 
as of the date of the company latest impairment test  the fair value of the americas reporting unit within the global components business segment and the fair value of the north america and emea reporting units within the global ecs business segment exceeded their carrying values by approximately   and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets  for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable 
the company also tests indefinite lived intangible assets  consisting of acquired trade names  for impairment at least annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference 
during  the company recorded an impairment charge of million in connection with an approved plan to market and sell a building and related land in the united states within the company global components business segment 
the company wrote down the carrying values of the building and related land to their estimated fair values less cost to sell and ceased recording depreciation 
during  the company recorded an additional impairment charge of million as a result of further declines in real estate valuations 
as of december  and  the assets were designated as assets held for sale  and the carrying values of million and million  respectively  were included in other current assets on the company consolidated balance sheets 
the sale was completed in the first quarter of factors which may cause an impairment of long lived assets include significant changes in the manner of use of these assets  negative industry or market trends  a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  or a likely sale or disposal of the asset before the end of its estimated useful life 
if any of these factors exist  the company is required to test the long lived asset for recoverability and may be required to recognize an impairment charge for all or a portion of the asset carrying value 
during the fourth quarter of  as a result of significant declines in macroeconomic conditions  global equity valuations depreciated 
both factors impacted the company s market capitalization  and the company determined it was necessary to review the recoverability of its long lived assets to be held and used  including property  plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets  by comparing the carrying value of the related asset groups to the undiscounted cash flows directly attributable to the asset groups over the estimated useful life of those assets 
based upon the results of such tests as of december   the company s long lived assets to be held and used were not impaired 
shipping and handling costs shipping and handling costs are reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company reports shipping and handling costs  primarily related to outbound freight  in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
if the company included such costs in cost of sales  gross profit margin as a percentage of sales for would decrease basis points from to with a corresponding decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses and no impact on reported earnings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company  as a large  global organization  faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could materially impact the company financial results in the future 
the company primary exposure relates to transactions in which the currency collected from customers is different from the currency utilized to purchase the product sold in europe  the asia pacific region  canada  and latin america 
the company policy is to hedge substantially all such currency exposures for which natural hedges do not exist 
natural hedges exist when purchases and sales within a specific country are both denominated in the same currency and  therefore  no exposure exists to hedge with foreign exchange forward  option  or swap contracts collectively  the foreign exchange contracts 
in many regions in asia  for example  sales and purchases are primarily denominated in us dollars  resulting in a natural hedge 
natural hedges exist in most countries in which the company operates  although the percentage of natural offsets  as compared with offsets that need to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts  will vary from country to country 
the company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
the risk of loss on a foreign exchange contract is the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties  which the company minimizes by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions 
the fair values of the foreign exchange contracts  which are nominal  are estimated using market quotes 
the notional amount of the foreign exchange contracts at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the translation of the financial statements of the non united states operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the change in consolidated sales and operating income was impacted by the translation of the company international financial statements into us dollars 
this resulted in reduced sales and increased operating income of million and million  respectively  for  compared with the year earlier period  based on sales and operating income at the average rate for sales and operating income would decrease by approximately million and million  respectively  if average foreign exchange rates had declined by against the us dollar in these amounts were determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical foreign exchange rate on the sales and operating income of the company international operations 
in may  the company entered into a cross currency swap  with a maturity date of july  for approximately million or million 
in october  the company entered into a cross currency swap  with a maturity date of october  for approximately million or million 
these cross currency swaps were designated as net investment hedges and hedged a portion of the company net investment in euro denominated net assets  by effectively converting the interest expense on million of long term debt from us dollars to euros 
during  the company paid million  plus accrued interest  to terminate these cross currency swaps 
the cross currency swaps had a negative fair value at december  of million 
interest rate risk the company s interest expense  in part  is sensitive to the general level of interest rates in north america  europe  and the asia pacific region 
the company historically has managed its exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and floating rate debt in its total debt portfolio 
additionally  the company utilizes interest rate swaps in order to manage its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
at december   approximately of the company s debt was subject to fixed rates  and of its debt was subject to floating rates 
a one percentage point change in average interest rates would not materially impact net interest and other financing expense in this was determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical interest rate on the company s average floating rate on investments and outstanding debt 
this analysis does not consider the effect of the level of overall economic activity that could exist 
in the event of a change in the level of economic activity  which may adversely impact interest rates  the company could likely take actions to further mitigate any potential negative exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that might be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
in june and november  the company entered into interest rate swaps  with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the swaps modify the company interest rate exposure by effectively converting a portion of the fixed senior notes to a floating rate  based on the six month us dollar libor plus a spread an effective rate of and at december  and  respectively  through its maturity 
the swaps are classified as fair value hedges and had a fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
in december  the company entered into interest rate swaps  with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the swaps modify the company interest rate exposure by effectively converting the fixed notes to a floating rate  based on the three month us dollar libor plus a spread an effective rate of approximately at december   through its maturity 
the swaps are classified as fair value hedges and had a negative fair value of 
million at december
