item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock  which could affect its market price 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth  development and expansion of our business and or to repay existing indebtedness 
accordingly  we do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
the declaration  payment and amount of future dividends  if any  will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors  including our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow from operations  current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans  the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of delaware law 
in addition  the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility includes restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends without meeting certain financial ratios and obtaining the consent of the lenders 
accordingly  holders of common stock will not receive cash payments on their investment and the market price may be adversely affected 
future sales or other issuances of our common stock could adversely affect its market price 
we have a large number of shares of common stock outstanding and available for resale beginning at various points in time in the future 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the possibility that these sales may occur  could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 
as of december   there were million shares of live nation common stock outstanding including million shares of unvested restricted stock awards and excluding million shares held in treasury  million shares issuable from unvested restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards  million shares of common stock issuable from options currently exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of per share  million shares issuable from the conversion of our convertible notes and a warrant to purchase million shares of common stock at an exercise price of we continually explore acquisition opportunities consistent with our strategy 
these acquisitions may involve the payment of cash  the incurrence of debt or the issuance of common stock or other securities 
any such issuance could be at a valuation lower than the trading price of our common stock at the time 
the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our common stock 
the hedging or arbitrage could  in turn  affect the trading prices of our convertible notes 
conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may affect our per share results and the trading price of our common stock 
the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 
issuances of stock on conversion may also affect our per share results of operations 
any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

table of contents we can issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could materially adversely affect the rights of common stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue blank check preferred stock  the designation  number  voting powers  preferences and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by the board of directors 
our subsidiaries may also issue additional shares of preferred stock 
accordingly  the board of directors has the authority  without stockholder approval  to issue preferred stock with rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the common stockholders or the market value of the common stock 
risks relating to the separation the separation could result in significant tax liability to our initial public stockholders 
in connection with the separation  clear channel received a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of our common stock to its stockholders qualified as a tax free distribution for united states federal income tax purposes under sections and a d of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code 
although a private letter ruling from the irs generally is binding on the irs  if the factual representations or assumptions made in the letter ruling request are untrue or incomplete in any material respect  we will not be able to rely on the ruling 
furthermore  the irs will not rule on whether a distribution satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax free treatment under section of the code 
rather  the ruling is based upon representations by clear channel that these conditions have been satisfied  and any inaccuracy in such representations could invalidate the ruling 
therefore  in addition to obtaining the ruling from the irs  clear channel also obtained a legal opinion that the separation will qualify as a tax free distribution for united states federal income tax purposes under sections and a d of the code 
the opinion relies on the ruling as to matters covered by the ruling 
in addition  the opinion is based on  among other things  certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by clear channel and us  which if incorrect or inaccurate in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion 
the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts  and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion 
notwithstanding receipt by clear channel of the ruling and opinion of counsel  the irs could assert that the separation did not qualify for tax free treatment for united states federal income tax purposes 
if the irs were successful in taking this position  our initial public stockholders could be subject to significant united states federal income tax liability 
in general  our initial public stockholders could be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of our common stock that was distributed to them 
the separation could result in significant tax related liabilities to us 
as discussed above  notwithstanding receipt by clear channel of the ruling and the opinion of counsel  the irs could assert that the separation did not qualify for tax free treatment for united states federal income tax purposes 
if the irs were successful in taking this position  clear channel could be subject to a significant united states federal income tax liability 
in general  clear channel would be subject to tax as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value 
in addition  even if the separation otherwise were to qualify under section of the code  it may be taxable to clear channel as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value under section e of the code  if the separation were later deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a or greater interest in clear channel or us 
for this purpose  any acquisitions of clear channel stock or of our stock within the period beginning two years before the separation and ending two years after  are presumed to be part of such a plan  although we or clear channel may be able to rebut that presumption 
although such corporate level taxes  if any  resulting from a taxable distribution generally would be imposed on clear channel  we have agreed in the tax matters agreement to indemnify clear channel and its affiliates against tax related liabilities  if any  caused by the failure of the separation to qualify as a tax free transaction under section of the code including as a result of section e of the code if the failure to so qualify is attributable to actions  events or transactions relating to our stock  assets or business  or a breach of the relevant representations or covenants made by us in the tax matters agreement 
if the failure of the separation to qualify under section of the code is for any reason for which neither we nor clear channel is responsible  we and clear channel have agreed in the tax matters agreement that we will each be responsible for of the tax related liabilities arising from the failure to so qualify 
clear channel reported a billion capital loss as a result of the separation
