overview we are a leader in certain technologies involving the design and development of value added glass products  services and systems 
the company is comprised of two segments architectural products and services architectural and large scale optical technologies lso 
our architectural segment companies design  engineer  fabricate  install  maintain and renovate the walls of glass  windows  storefront and entrances comprising the outside skin of commercial and institutional buildings 
businesses in this segment are viracon  inc  including glassecviracon  fabricator of coated  high performance architectural glass for global markets  harmon  inc  one of the largest us full service building glass installation and renovation companies  wausau window and wall systems  a manufacturer of standard and custom aluminum window systems and curtainwall for the north american commercial construction market  linetec  a paint and anodizing finisher of architectural aluminum and pvc shutters for us markets  and tubelite inc tubelite  a fabricator of aluminum storefront  entrance and curtainwall products for the us commercial construction industry 
our lso segment consists of tru vue  inc  a manufacturer of value added glass and acrylic for the custom picture framing market 
the following are the key items that impacted fiscal the architectural segment s revenues were down as we continued to be impacted by difficult us commercial construction market conditions  which have been affected by low us employment levels and high vacancy rates for commercial buildings 
operating results were down due to lower volume  pricing and project margins as a result of the difficult commercial construction market conditions 
despite weak retail market conditions throughout most of fiscal  our lso segment was able to increase revenue and operating income as new and ongoing value added product customers continued to convert to our best framing products during fiscal we acquired glassec vidros de seguran a ltda 
glassec for million in november the business operates under the name glassecviracon as part of the company s architectural glass business 
glassecviracon s fiscal year ends december and is reported in the consolidated financial statements on a two month lag 
glassecviracon contributed million of sales to our architectural segment for the period subsequent to acquisition 
our backlog increased to million at february   compared to million at february  the architectural segment backlog  which represents more than percent of the backlog  was up over the prior year due to the addition of glassecviracon  which added million to backlog 
bidding activity has remained solid  however  bid to award and contract timing continues to be slow 

table of contents strategy 
the following describes our business strategy for each of our segments 
architectural segment 
our architectural segment serves the commercial construction market  which is highly cyclical 
we have five business units within this segment that participate at various stages of the glass fabrication  window and wall supply chain each with nationally recognized brands and leading positions in their target market segments 
the glass and window and wall systems enclose commercial buildings such as offices  hospitals  educational facilities  government facilities  high end condominiums and retail centers 
we believe building contractors value our ability to deliver quality  customized window and curtainwall solutions to projects on time and on budget  helping to minimize costly job site labor overruns 
their customers building owners and developers value the distinctive look  energy efficient and hurricane and blast protection features of our glass systems 
these benefits can contribute to higher lease rates  lower operating costs due to the energy efficiency of our value added glass  a more comfortable environment for building occupants  and protection for buildings and occupants from hurricanes and blasts 
we look at several market indicators  such as office space vacancy rates  architectural billing statistics  employment  and other economic indicators  to gain insight into the commercial construction market 
one of our primary indicators is the us non residential construction market activity as documented by mcgraw hill construction mcgraw hill  a leading independent provider of construction industry analysis  forecasts and trends 
we utilize the information for the building types that we typically supply office towers  hotels  retail centers  education facilities and dormitories  health care facilities  government buildings and high end condominiums and adjust this information which is based on construction starts to align with our fiscal year and the lag that is required to account for when our products and services typically are initiated in a construction project approximately eight months after project start 
from the mcgraw hill data  our markets had an annual compounded growth rate of negative percent over our past three fiscal years 
our segment s compounded annual growth rate over that same period was negative percent 
our overall strategy in this segment is to defend and grow market share over a cycle by extending our presence while remaining focused on distinctive solutions for enclosing commercial buildings 
we draw upon our leading brands  energy efficient products and reputation for high quality and service in pursuit of our strategy 
each of our existing businesses has the ability to grow through geographic or product line expansion  and we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities in adjacent segments 
finally  we aspire to lead our markets in the development of practical  energy efficient products for green buildings and the ability to deliver them in a sustainable manner 
our architectural businesses have introduced products and services designed to meet the growing demand for green building materials 
these products have included new energy efficient glass coatings  thermally enhanced aluminum framing systems and systems with high amounts of recycled content 
while our lag adjusted markets are projected to continue to contract slightly into fiscal  we are pursuing the same basic strategy with some adjustment for market conditions 
we have raised pricing of our architectural glass products to better take advantage of our position as a leader in the marketplace  and we have been and continue to take measures to keep our cost structure in line with revenue  including continuing to focus on productivity while maintaining capacity in order to gain market share when the market recovers 
we acquired glassec  a leading architectural glass fabricator in brazil  in november  increasing our architectural glass footprint in a market where we can provide technical and operational excellence to this developing  but fast growing  market 
we have been successful in bidding installation work in new metropolitan markets to offset declines in core markets 
we are focusing on renovation and new projects in the institutional sector  including government buildings  a sector that continues to be more stable than private sector construction 
we have tightened our capital spending criteria  although we continue to have cash available for strategic investments for both international and domestic initiatives 
we expect to emerge from the current downturn poised to win market share from competitors who were not as well positioned or do not have funds available to weather the current down cycle 
lso segment 
our basic strategy in this segment is to convert the custom picture framing market from clear uncoated glass to value added glass that protects art from uv damage while minimizing reflection from the glass so that viewers see the art rather than the glass 
we estimate that over percent of the retail picture framing market has converted to value added glass  although we are finding it more difficult to convert the ultimate potential is significantly higher 
we offer a variety of products with varying levels of reflection control and promote the benefits to consumers with point of purchase displays and other promotional materials 
we also work to educate the fragmented custom picture framing market about the opportunity to improve the profitability of their framing business by offering value added glass 
in fiscal  we extended this strategy to the fine art market  which includes museums and private collections 
we also made capital investments to support the conversion to value added picture framing products as well as to grow the fine art market 
as part of that extension  we developed value added acrylic products in addition to glass 
acrylic is a preferred material in the fine art markets because the art can be much larger and weight is an important consideration 
in fiscal  we expanded our strategies to include other markets that can be served with anti reflective acrylic products 

table of contents in fiscal  we established an initiative to begin selling our products in europe  where we have had very little historical presence 
we believe our products and distribution networks will enable us to grow at a faster pace in europe than what we will be able to grow our domestic market share 
results of operations net sales dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
net sales fiscal compared to fiscal sales decreased percent due to challenging commercial construction market conditions  which have resulted in lower demand  driving lower volume across all architectural segment business lines  and lower pricing  largely in our architectural glass business 
glassecviracon contributed million of sales to our architectural segment for the period subsequent to acquisition 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales decreased percent primarily due to the decline in the commercial construction market 
the majority of the decline resulted from reduced volume in the architectural glass and installation businesses  but sales were also impacted by lower prices across all of the architectural segment businesses 
lack of available us commercial real estate credit and low us employment levels negatively impacted the commercial construction market in fiscal performance the relationship between various components of operations  as a percentage of net sales  is illustrated below for the past three fiscal years 
percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating loss income interest income interest expense other income  net results from equity method investee loss earnings from continuing operations before income taxes income tax benefit expense loss earnings from continuing operations earnings from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net loss earnings effective income tax rate for continuing operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated gross profit was down percentage points due to lower pricing  primarily in our architectural glass business  as well as lower project margins and the impact of low capacity utilization from lower volume in our architectural segment 
during fiscal  we incurred unusually high costs to resolve architectural glass product quality issues from a vendor supplied material  as well as other quality issues  which negatively impacted gross profit by approximately million  or percentage points 
our lso segment had favorable results for the year due to the ongoing strong mix of value added picture framing product and positive operating performance  partially offsetting the items above 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased as a percent of sales to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal  while spending decreased by million 
the decrease in spending relates to reduced accruals for incentive and long term executive compensation expenses  lower spending on discretionary items as we focused on cost management  and reduced salaries and employee related expenses as a result of headcount reductions 
the increase as a percent of sales was largely due to our inability to leverage expenses over a lower level of sales dollars 

table of contents fiscal earnings from discontinued operations of million reflect favorable resolution of an outstanding tax exposure related to a foreign operation discontinued in the resolution of this exposure provided non cash income from discontinued operations of million in the second quarter 
fiscal also included a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter for expected settlement of an exposure related to a foreign operation discontinued in this settlement was finalized in march  and we expect to pay approximately million in the first half of fiscal for final resolution of this matter 
the settlements of these two items represent the last significant remaining items with respect to our international curtainwall business 
fiscal income of million was due to the favorable resolution of an outstanding lease claim and a reduction in reserves related to the expiration of warranty periods 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated gross profit improved by percentage points primarily due to improvements in margins in the installation and window businesses as a result of project mix and execution of work that was largely bid in stronger markets 
in addition  our picture framing business saw a positive mix of our best value added glass and acrylic products in fiscal cost management and productivity improvements throughout the company  partially offset by the impact of fixed costs on lower sales and lower pricing in the second half fiscal for the architectural glass business  also contributed to the improvement in gross profit margin 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased as a percent of sales to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal  while spending decreased by million 
the decrease in spending primarily related to lower sales and marketing expenses  reduced salaries and employee related expenses as a result of headcount reductions  and lower spending on consulting and other discretionary items as we focused on cost management 
these items were partially offset by a year over year increase in bonus and long term incentive expenses 
the fiscal bonus and long term incentive compensation expenses were impacted by lower projected payouts of stock based incentives as a result of reducing the outlook for future years 
the increase as a percent of sales was largely due to our inability to leverage expenses over a lower level of sales dollars 
interest expense decreased million in fiscal due to reduced debt levels 
results from equity method investee in fiscal reflected the gain on sale of our percent interest in an automotive replacement glass distribution business  ppg auto glass  llc 
during fiscal and in connection with ppg s sale of its automotive replacement glass businesses  we exercised our right to sell our minority interest in the ppg auto glass joint venture  resulting in cash proceeds of million and a pretax gain on sale of approximately million 
during fiscal  the joint venture reported a loss of million primarily due to soft conditions in the auto glass replacement market 
as a result of the sale  there was no impact from the joint venture in fiscal the effective income tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal was percent compared to percent in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reductions in reserves and deferred tax accounts in fiscal as a result of changes in estimates for previous tax positions taken 
fiscal earnings from discontinued operations were million compared to a loss of million in fiscal the fiscal earnings were due to the favorable resolution of an outstanding lease claim and a reduction in reserves related to the expiration of warranty periods 
segment analysis architectural products and services architectural in thousands net sales operating loss income operating loss income as a percent of sales fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal net sales decreased million or percent from fiscal  a decline that is in line with the percent decline in our markets served  according to mcgraw hill data 
we continue to be impacted by difficult us commercial construction market conditions  with low employment levels and high vacancy rates for commercial buildings 
volume and pricing decreased across all of our architectural businesses  with our architectural glass business significantly impacted by lower pricing 
glassecviracon contributed million of sales to our architectural segment for the period subsequent to acquisition 

table of contents for fiscal  the segment incurred an operating loss of million  with an operating margin of negative percent compared to operating income of million in fiscal  with an operating margin of percent 
the decrease in operating margin was due to lower pricing in our architectural glass business  lower project margins  the impact of low capacity utilization from lower volume  expenses related to architectural glass quality issues and costs to implement architectural glass productivity improvements 
during fiscal  we incurred costs to resolve architectural glass product quality issues from a vendor supplied material  as well as other quality issues  which negatively impacted gross profit by approximately million  or percentage points 
glassecviracon s contribution to the operating loss was minimal 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal net sales decreased million or percent from fiscal  primarily due to declines in the commercial construction market 
our glass fabrication business was impacted most significantly as it has historically depended on the large project and office sectors  which slowed more significantly during fiscal than the rest of the market 
lack of available us commercial real estate credit and low us employment levels continued to negatively impact the commercial construction market throughout fiscal fiscal operating income of million  or percent of sales  decreased million or percent from fiscal operating income of million  or percent of sales 
the decline in operating income was due to low capacity utilization in the segment  declining pricing and a declining mix of work that was bid in stronger markets 
these items were partially offset by productivity improvements and ongoing cost cutting measures at all businesses within the segment 
large scale optical technologies lso in thousands net sales operating income operating income as a percent of sales fiscal compared to fiscal lso revenues increased million  or percent  in fiscal to million from million in fiscal on volume growth of percent 
lso segment operating income as a percent of sales improved to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal with a million increase in operating income 
throughout fiscal  we continued to see new and ongoing value added product customers convert to our best picture framing products 
operating income benefited from increased volume  a stronger mix of value added products and improved productivity 
fiscal results included the write off of certain production equipment which negatively impacted fiscal margins by percentage points 
fiscal compared to fiscal lso revenues were down million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal lso segment operating income as a percent of sales improved to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal while operating income was relatively flat year on year 
we maintained revenues and operating income despite weak custom picture framing market conditions as new and ongoing value added product customers converted to our best picture framing products 
the business also benefited from productivity improvements due to leveraging significant investments made in this business during fiscal and these items were partially offset by the write off of certain production equipment held for sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal consolidated backlog at february   our consolidated backlog was million  up percent over the million reported at february   fiscal included million in backlog from glassecviracon 
the backlog of the architectural segment represented more than percent of consolidated backlog 
we expect percent of our total backlog to be recognized in fiscal revenue 
we view backlog as an important statistic in evaluating the level of sales activity and short term sales trends in our business 
however  as backlog is only one indicator  and is not an effective indicator of our ultimate profitability  we do not believe that backlog should be used as the sole indicator of future earnings of the company 
acquisitions on november   we acquired percent of the stock of glassec vidros de seguran a ltda  a privately held business  for million  net of cash acquired of million 
glassec is a leading architectural glass fabricator in brazil 
the business operates under the name glassecviracon as part of the company s architectural glass business 
glassecviracon s fiscal year ends december and is reported in the consolidated financial statements within our architectural segment for the period subsequent to the acquisition date on a two month lag 
the purchase is part of our strategy to increase our architectural glass penetration in international markets 
goodwill recorded as part of the purchase price allocation was million and is not tax deductible 
identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition were million and include customer relationships  trademarks  patents and non compete agreements with a weighted average useful life of years 

table of contents discontinued operations in several transactions in fiscal years through  we completed the sale of our large scale domestic curtainwall business  the sale of our detention security business and the exit from international curtainwall operations 
the remaining estimated cash expenditures related to these discontinued operations are recorded as liabilities of discontinued operations  and a majority of the remaining cash expenditures related to discontinued operations is expected to be paid within the next year 
the majority of these liabilities relate to the international curtainwall operations  including bonds outstanding  which have been settled and will be paid in the next year 
the reserve for discontinued operations also covers other liability issues  consisting of warranty and other costs relating to these and other international construction projects that we expect to be resolved over the next five years 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  expected settlement of an outstanding legal claim related to a foreign discontinued operation resulted in a million increase in reserves and a pre tax loss from discontinued operations 
this settlement was finalized in march  and we expect to pay approximately million in the first half of fiscal for final resolution of this matter 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the favorable resolution of an outstanding tax exposure related to a foreign operation discontinued in resulted in the release of million of uncertain tax positions and non cash income from discontinued operations 
the settlements of these two items represent the last significant remaining items with respect to our international curtainwall business 
during fiscal  a favorable resolution of an outstanding lease claim and a reduction in reserves related to the expiration of warranty periods resulted in pre tax income from discontinued operations of million 
for fiscal  we reported a net loss from discontinued operations of million 
related party transactions in connection with ppg s sale of its automotive replacement glass businesses during fiscal  we exercised our right to sell our minority interest in the ppg auto glass joint venture 
as a result  ppg and ppg auto glass are no longer deemed to be related parties 
liquidity and capital resources cash effect  in thousands net cash used in provided by continuing operating activities capital expenditures acquisition of businesses and intangibles  net of cash acquired purchases of restricted investments  net proceeds from sale of investment in affiliated company net sales purchases of short term investments and marketable securities borrowing repayment activities  net purchases and retirement of company common stock dividends paid operating activities 
cash used by operating activities was million in fiscal while cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal and was million in fiscal lower earnings  as well as less cash generated from declining receivables and the change in tax positions in the current year as compared to the prior year impacted cash flow from operations in fiscal the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was due to lower earnings in fiscal we continue to focus on lowering our working capital requirements 
non cash working capital current assets  excluding cash  short term investments and short term restricted investments  less current liabilities  our key metric for measuring working capital efficiency  was million at february  or percent of fiscal sales 
this compares to million at february  or percent of fiscal sales 
the deterioration in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a decrease in our accrued expenses because of payments made to fund annual incentive compensation and retirement plan contributions  as well as a change in our tax position  as this year we have a sizable refundable tax position  compared to a smaller refundable tax position last year 
we believe this metric will be negatively impacted during fiscal as the us commercial construction market improves  requiring more working capital to support increasing business activities 
investing activities 
investing activities used net cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the fiscal and expenditures were focused on safety and maintenance projects  as well as quick pay back productivity improvements 
fiscal spending was primarily for productivity improvements and capacity expansions in both operating segments  including approximately million for a new leed silver architectural window facility 

table of contents fiscal investing activities included the acquisition of glassec on november  we acquired all of the shares of glassec  a privately held business  for million  net of cash acquired of million 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains further information regarding this acquisition 
the purchases of restricted investments of million were related to money market funds required to be made available to cover our exposure for letters of credit under our old revolving credit facility and credit card programs as well as the funds received as a result of the recovery zone facility bonds that were made available for future investment in our architectural glass fabrication facility in utah 
in fiscal  we received million of proceeds on the sale of our interest in the ppg auto glass joint venture 
the net position of our investments for fiscal resulted in million in net sales versus net purchases of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the change in our investment position was due to activities to increase the amount of investments in cash equivalents in the current year to fund the acquisition of glassec 
we anticipate that our fiscal maintenance and safety related capital expenditures will be less than million 
we continue to review our portfolio of businesses and their assets in comparison to our internal strategic and performance objectives 
as part of this review  we may acquire other businesses  further invest in  fully divest and or sell parts of our current businesses 
at february   the company had one sale and leaseback agreement for a building that provides an option to purchase the building at projected future fair market value upon expiration of the lease in the lease is classified as an operating lease 
the company had a deferred gain of million under this sale and leaseback transaction  which is included as accrued expenses and other long term liabilities 
the average annual lease payment over the life of the remaining lease is million 
subsequent to fiscal year end  we entered into an agreement for the sale and leaseback of equipment for a sale price of million 
under the sale and leaseback agreement  we have an option to purchase the equipment at projected future fair market value upon expiration of the lease  which occurs in fiscal the lease will be classified as an operating lease 
financing activities 
total outstanding borrowings at february  were million  compared to million at both february  and february  the current year increase was due to million of recovery zone facility bonds issued during the first quarter for future investment in our architectural glass fabrication facility in utah 
we also assumed approximately million in debt  of which million was outstanding at february   as part of the glassec acquisition 
the remaining million consists solely of industrial development bonds 
our debt to total capital ratio was percent at february   compared to percent at february  during fiscal  the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of  shares of common stock 
the board of directors increased this authorization by  shares in january and by  in october there were no share repurchases in fiscal or we have purchased a total of  shares  at a total cost of million  since the inception of this program 
we have remaining authority to repurchase  shares under this program  which has no expiration date 
in addition to the shares repurchased under the repurchase plan  we also reacquired million and million of company stock from employees in order to satisfy stock for stock option exercises or withholding tax obligations related to stock based compensation  pursuant to terms of board and shareholder approved compensation plans during fiscal and  respectively 
we paid million in dividends during the current year  compared to million in the prior year 

table of contents other financing activities 
the following summarizes significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity future cash payments due by period in thousands thereafter total industrial revenue bonds recovery zone facility bonds other debt obligations operating leases undiscounted purchase obligations other obligations total cash obligations during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into a three year  committed  secured  revolving credit facility  in the amount of million subject to increase to an amount not exceeding million 
the credit facility expires in january our fiscal 
no borrowings were outstanding as of february  the credit facility includes a letter of credit facility in the amount of up to million  the outstanding amounts of which decrease the available commitment 
we may elect borrowings under the facility to bear interest at one of two interest rates per annum equal either to the sum of the libor rate and the applicable margin which is based on our adjusted debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ratio or the sum of the base rate and the applicable margin 
the base rate is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of i the interest rate announced by the administrative agent as its prime rate  ii the sum of percent per annum and the federal funds rate in effect on such day  and iii libor plus percent 
the applicable margin would be in the range of percent to percent when applied to libor  and would range from percent to percent when applied to the base rate contingent upon our adjusted debt to ebitda ratio 
this credit facility replaces our previous million unsecured  revolving credit facility that was set to expire in november there were no borrowings outstanding under the previous facility at february  the credit facility requires that we maintain a minimum level of net worth as defined in the credit facility based on certain quarterly financial calculations 
the minimum required net worth computed in accordance with the credit agreement at february  was million  whereas our net worth as defined in the credit facility was million 
the credit facility also requires that we maintain an adjusted debt to ebitda ratio of not more than 
this ratio is computed quarterly  with ebitda computed on a rolling four quarter basis 
for purposes of calculating the adjusted debt to ebitda ratio  we reduce debt to the extent of unrestricted cash balances  cash equivalents and short term investments in excess of million  but no more than million of debt  and not debt consisting of credit facility borrowings  may be offset 
our ratio was at february  if we are not in compliance with either of these covenants  the lenders may terminate the commitment and or declare any loan then outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
at february   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of the credit facility 
we assumed debt of million as part of the glassec acquisition  of which million was outstanding at february  and million of which was recorded as current maturities of long term debt 
the acquired debt matures in fiscal years through and has a weighted average interest rate of percent 
during the first quarter of fiscal  million of recovery zone facility bonds were issued and made available for future investment in our architectural glass fabrication facility in utah 
interest on the bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income and alternative minimum tax purposes 
the interest rate on the bonds resets weekly and is equal to the market rate of interest earned for similar revenue bonds or other tax free securities 
the bonds will mature on april  the proceeds are reported as restricted investments in the consolidated balance sheet until disbursed  million was disbursed during fiscal long term debt at february   consists of million of recovery zone facility bonds  million of industrial development bonds and million of glassecviracon debt 
at february   long term debt consisted of just the million of industrial development bonds 
the industrial development and recovery zone facility bonds mature in fiscal years through from time to time  we acquire the use of certain assets  such as warehouses  automobiles  forklifts  vehicles  office equipment  hardware  software and some manufacturing equipment through operating leases 
many of these operating leases have termination penalties 
however  because the assets are used in the conduct of our business operations  it is unlikely that any significant portion of these operating leases would be terminated prior to the normal expiration of their lease terms 
therefore  we consider the risk related to termination penalties to be minimal 

table of contents as of february   we have purchase obligations totaling million  the majority of which are for raw material commitments 
the other obligations in the table above relate to non compete and consulting agreements with current and former employees 
we expect to make contributions of million to our defined benefit pension plans in fiscal  which will equal or exceed our minimum funding requirements 
as of february   we had million and million of unrecognized tax benefits and environmental liabilities  respectively 
we are unable to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled 
at february   we had ongoing letters of credit related to construction contracts and certain industrial development bonds 
the company s million of industrial revenue bonds are supported by million of letters of credit 
on april   million of recovery zone facility bonds were made available for future investment in architectural glass fabrication facilities  which are supported by a million letter of credit 
the letters of credit by expiration period were as follows at february  amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands thereafter total standby letters of credit in addition to the above standby letters of credit  which were predominantly issued for our industrial development bonds  we are required  in the ordinary course of business  to obtain a surety or performance bond that commits payments to our customers for any non performance by us 
at february   million of our backlog was bonded by performance bonds with a face value of million 
performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates  as we are released from the bonds upon completion of the contract 
we have never been required to pay on these performance based bonds with respect to any of our current portfolio of businesses 
we self insure our third party product liability coverages 
as a result  a material construction project rework event would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
for fiscal  we believe that current cash on hand  cash generated from operating activities and available capacity under our committed revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund our working capital requirements  planned capital expenditures and dividend payments 
we had total cash and short term investments of million at february  and million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility 
we believe that this will provide us with the financial strength to work through the ongoing weak market conditions and to continue our growth strategy for the recovery 
off balance sheet arrangements 
with the exception of routine operating leases  we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements at february  or february  outlook we continue to face an unprecedented level of uncertainty in our architectural segment market 
the following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
overall revenues for the year are expected to be up slightly over fiscal we have the potential for positive earnings per share 
capital expenditures are projected to be less than million 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see new accounting standards set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future  which is incorporated by reference herein 

table of contents critical accounting policies management has evaluated the accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements and related notes  and believes those policies and estimates to be reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the most critical accounting policies and estimates applied in the presentation of our financial statements relate to accounting for future events 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  management is required to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss 
we have identified the following accounting policies as critical to our business and in the understanding of our results of operations and financial position revenue recognition our standard product sales terms are free on board fob shipping point or fob destination  and revenue is recognized when title has transferred 
however  our installation business records revenue on a percentage of completion basis as it relates to revenues earned from construction contracts 
during fiscal  approximately percent of our consolidated sales and percent of our architectural segment sales were recorded on a percentage of completion basis 
under this methodology  we compare the total costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs for the contract  and record that proportion of the total contract revenue in the period 
contract costs include materials  labor and other direct costs related to contract performance 
provisions are established for estimated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined 
amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items are included in contract revenue only when customers have approved them 
a significant number of estimates are used in these computations 
goodwill impairment to determine if there has been any impairment in accordance with accounting standards  we evaluate the goodwill on our balance sheet annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist through a two step process 
in step one  we value each of our reporting units and compare these values to the reporting units net book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the net book value  step two  which determines the amount of goodwill to impair  is performed 
we were not required to perform step two for fiscal although we consider public information for transactions made on similar businesses to ours  since there were no market comparables identified  we base our determination of fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology that involves significant judgments based upon projections of future performance 
in developing our discounted cash flow analysis  assumptions about future revenues and expenses  capital expenditures and changes in working capital are based on our annual operating plan and long term business plan for each of our reporting units 
these plans take into consideration numerous factors including historical experience  anticipated future economic conditions and growth expectations for the industries and end markets in which we participate 
these assumptions are determined over a five year  long term planning period 
the five year growth rates for revenues and operating profits vary for each reporting unit being evaluated 
revenues and operating profit beyond the five year period are projected to grow at a nominal perpetual growth rate for all reporting units 
the discount rate calculations are determined by assuming a company beta  market premium risk  size premium  the cost of debt and debt to capital ratio of a market participant 
in connection with completing this analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that the fair values of our architectural glass and storefront and entrance businesses did not exceed their carrying values by a significant amount 
goodwill for our architectural glass business and storefront and entrance business was million and million  respectively  at february  as part of our step one process for determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units  we make several assumptions  including our earnings and cash flow projections and discount rate  each of which have a significant impact on these values 
for our architectural glass business  if cash flow projections decreased by percent per year or if the discount rate  currently estimated at percent  was percentage points higher  we would have failed step one of the impairment test for this reporting unit  requiring a step two analysis 
likewise  for our storefront and entrance business  if cash flow projections decreased by percent per year or if the discount rate  currently estimated at percent  was percentage points higher  we would have failed step one of the impairment test for this reporting unit  requiring a step two analysis 
we continue to monitor our market capitalization  along with other operational performance measures and general economic conditions 
our assumptions include double digit pricing increases that were initiated in fiscal impacting the fiscal architectural glass business and a recovery of the commercial construction markets in fiscal  consistent with external data we have historically considered for this testing 
the inability to gain market acceptance of our price increases and or a significant downward trend in the market factors could cause us to reduce the estimated fair value of some or all of our reporting units and recognize a corresponding impairment of our goodwill in connection with a future goodwill impairment test 
reserves for disputes and claims regarding product liability and warranties from time to time  we are subject to claims associated with our products and services  principally as a result of disputes with our customers involving the performance or aesthetics of our architectural products 
the time period from when a claim is asserted to when it is resolved  either by dismissal  negotiation  settlement or litigation  can be several years 
while we maintain product liability insurance  the insurance policies include significant self retention of risk in the form of policy deductibles 
in addition  certain claims could be determined to be uninsured 
we reserve based on our estimates of known claims  as well as on anticipated claims for possible product warranty and rework costs based on historical product liability claims as a ratio of sales 

table of contents self insurance reserves we obtain substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential losses for general liability  workers compensation  automobile liability  employment practices  architect s and engineer s errors and omissions risk  and other miscellaneous coverages 
however  an amount of risk is retained on a self insured basis through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary 
reserve requirements are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses 
additionally  we maintain a self insurance reserve for our health insurance programs maintained for the benefit of our eligible employees 
we estimate a reserve based on historical levels of amounts for claims incurred but not reported 
stock based compensation we account for share based compensation by estimating the fair value of each share based payment award on the date of grant and  in the case of performance based awards  updating those values throughout the year and life of the award 
for these performance based awards  we estimate the future performance of the company as an input into the expense 
any change in the actual results from our assumptions could have a material impact on the company s operating results 
income taxes we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
as part of our ongoing financial reporting process  a collaborative effort is undertaken involving our management with responsibility for financial reporting  product and project management  quality  legal  tax and outside advisors such as consultants  engineers  lawyers and actuaries 
the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base its judgments on these future events and develop the estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements related to these events are based on the best estimates and judgments of apogee management 
however  outcomes could differ from our estimates and could materially adversely affect our future operating results  financial position and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risk is sensitivity to interest rates  which is the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce net earnings of the company 
to manage our direct risk from changes in market interest rates  management actively monitors the interest sensitive components of our balance sheet  primarily debt obligations and fixed income securities  as well as market interest rates  in order to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates on net earnings and cash flow 
we have historically used interest rate swaps to fix a portion of our variable rate borrowings from fluctuations in interest rates 
during fiscal  we had interest rate swaps covering million of variable rate debt  which were terminated in the fourth quarter of fiscal resulting in a million pre tax charge to interest expense 
the interest rate swaps were designated as and were effective as cash flow hedges  and were included in the balance sheet with other long term liabilities  with changes in fair values included in other comprehensive income 
derivative gains and losses included in other comprehensive income were reclassified into earnings at the time the related interest expense was recognized  upon settlement or termination of the related commitment 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the primary measure of interest rate risk is the simulation of net income under different interest rate environments 
the approach used to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis 
this approach calculates the impact on net earnings  relative to a base case scenario  of rates increasing or decreasing gradually over the next months by basis points 
this change in interest rates affecting our financial instruments at february  would result in approximately a million impact to net earnings 
the company s investments exceeded its debt at february   so as interest rates increase  net earnings increase  as interest rates decrease  net earnings decrease 
in addition to the market risk related to interest rate changes  the commercial construction markets in which our businesses operate are highly affected by changes in interest rates and  therefore  significant interest rate fluctuations could materially impact our operating results 
our investment portfolio consists of variable rate demand note vrdn securities and municipal bonds 
at february   we had total investments of million  which are considered available for sale securities 
although these investments are subject to the credit risk of the issuer and or letter of credit issuer  we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to 
table of contents any one issuer 
because of the credit risk criteria of our investment policies and practices  the primary market risks associated with these investments are interest rate and liquidity risks 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates 
a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of our municipal bond portfolio 
through our acquisition of glassec in fiscal  we conduct business in a location outside of the us  and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency  the us dollar 
we generally do not use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
the functional currency of glassecviracon is the local currency in the country of domicile  the brazilian real 
we manage these operating activities at the local level and revenues  costs  assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies  thereby mitigating the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange 
however  our results of operations and assets and liabilities are reported in us dollars and thus will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates between brazilian real and the us dollar 
our domestic businesses generally sell within the united states  with sales made outside of the united states generally denominated in us dollars
