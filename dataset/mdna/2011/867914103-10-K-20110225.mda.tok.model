in the md a  net interest income  net interest margin  and the efficiency ratio are presented on an fte basis and the quarterly ratios are presented on an annualized basis 
the fte basis adjusts for the tax favored status of income from certain loans and investments 
we believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources 
we also present diluted earnings per common share excluding goodwill and intangible impairment charges 
we believe the exclusion of the impairment charges is more reflective of normalized operations and allows better comparability with peers throughout the industry 
additionally  we present roe as well as a return on average realized common shareholders equity 
we also present roa as well as roa less net realized and unrealized securities gains losses 
the return on average realized common shareholders equity and roa less net realized and unrealized securities gains losses exclude realized securities gains and losses and the coke dividend from the numerator  and net unrealized securities gains from the denominator 
we present a tangible efficiency ratio and a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio  which excludes the effect of intangible assets costs 
we believe these measures are useful to investors because  by removing the effect of intangible asset costs the level of which may vary from company to company  it allows investors to more easily compare our efficiency and capital adequacy to other companies in the industry 
we also present a tangible book value per common share ratio which excludes the after tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets 
these measures are utilized by management to assess our financial performance and capital adequacy 
we provide reconcilements in tables and in the md a for all non us gaap measures

executive overview economic and regulatory while signs of economic recovery began in  the effects of the recession continued to be felt throughout the year as economic growth was insufficient to abate elevated unemployment and to increase capital spending and consumer consumption 
while the unemployment rate eased slightly during  it remains elevated 
individuals and businesses were not the only ones affected during the year  as ongoing deterioration in the fiscal position of certain us states and 
table of contents municipalities was prevalent and threatened the risk of increased local taxes and budget cuts 
at the federal government level  congress reached a compromise and maintained lower individual tax rates for at least two years 
the federal reserve has forecast a gradual economic recovery through  and  as a result  the federal reserve has reaffirmed that it will maintain key interest rates at record lows for an extended period of time as long as the economic data supports these low rates 
additionally  the federal reserve announced towards the end of that they would further intercede in the financial markets  in the form of additional financial support  if needed 
pursuant to this  the federal reserve announced reinvestments of billion of treasury securities through the middle of in an attempt to maintain lower interest rates and stimulate additional growth in the economy and to spur expanded consumer and business spending 
despite the slow and uneven economic recovery  the equity markets provided some encouragement for the recovery  advancing more than during regulatory and financial reform was a focal point during the year as the financial reform bill  known as the dodd frank act  was signed into law during the third quarter and its implementation will result in significant changes to the financial services industry 
the ultimate impact to us and the financial services industry as a whole remains largely to be determined  as the work of translating legislative policies into regulation continues 
however  while it is clear that financial regulation will affect our operations  compliance requirements  and  accordingly  our financial results  we believe that it will be manageable 
some of the regulations will likely have little impact on our results 
conversely  other items will have a quantifiable effect in the near term  such as new regulations regarding debit interchange fees 
the regulation imposes a limitation on fees and is still in the comment period 
we are hopeful that the final regulation takes into account a less narrow interpretation of the costs to operate a debit card business when establishing interchange fees 
the reform bill also mandated changes in fdic assessments and addressed a multitude of other industry supervisory matters 
while this legislation dictates a number of regulatory rule changes which have the potential to adversely impact us and others within our industry  we cannot determine at the present time what the absolute impacts will be when the regulations are eventually finalized 
in addition to the reform bill  during the year the federal reserve implemented changes to regulation e that restricts our ability to charge our clients overdraft fees for atm and debit card transactions 
we implemented the changes to regulation e during and the impact will continue into as clients continue to decide if they will opt in to overdraft coverage 
we are actively evaluating regulatory and legislative developments and will be in a position to comply with new requirements and take appropriate actions as warranted 
in addition to the regulatory reform items discussed above  new capital and liquidity requirements were proposed during that will impact us and our peers as they are phased in over the next several years 
the federal reserve  under the collins amendment of the dodd frank act  and the bcbs  in basel iii  proposed significant changes to the regulatory capital requirements 
the federal reserve is expected to adopt new capital requirements for certain bank holding companies that are at least as stringent as those already applicable to insured depositary institutions 
as a result  certain of our capital instruments that are currently considered tier capital  will be phased out over a three year period starting on january  we believe this will have about a basis point downward impact to our tier capital ratio over that three year period if capital doesn t increase over this same time frame as an offset to the impact 
the bcbs proposed capital requirements seek to further strengthen financial institutions capital positions by mandating a higher minimum level of common equity to be held  along with a capital conservation buffer to withstand future periods of stress 
our capital position today is particularly strong  especially considering our improving credit risk profile and relatively low market risk 
at present  our tier common equity is in excess of the minimum common equity and additional conservation buffer stipulated by these newly proposed requirements 
regardless  complying with these new capital requirements will likely affect our results  and the extent to which we will be affected will be known with more certainty once additional clarity is provided on the underlying details of these new requirements 
these new requirements must be endorsed by the us banking regulators  which is expected  and are anticipated to be phased in through as they are currently proposed by the bcbs 
in addition to the capital proposal  the bcbs also proposed standards that would increase and standardize global liquidity standards 
these proposals would require us  and other financial institutions  to comply with two new liquidity measurements  the lcr and nsfr 
see liquidity risk in this md a where these ratios are discussed further 
our regulators have not yet adopted these proposed standards  but the bcbs s recommended adoption dates are for the beginning of and for the respective standards 
the proposed standards may lead to changes in our funding structure and or investment portfolio  but until the proposed standards are translated into a final regulation we cannot quantify the impact 

table of contents financial performance while will be remembered as a year of challenge and change for our industry  we persevered through the economic and regulatory uncertainties and achieved improved financial performance compared to we returned to profitability during with a profit before payment of preferred dividends  our low cost deposits grew  demonstrating our success in increasing client loyalty and growing market share  revenue expanded and benefitted from a basis point expansion in net interest margin and solid performance from several of our key businesses  credit quality improved throughout the year led by declines in net charge offs  delinquencies  and nonperforming assets  capital ratios remained strong and expanded 
throughout this economic cycle  we maintained our focus on serving our clients and managing our core business to drive better bottom line results 
this focus  together with improved credit quality  resulted in net income of million in compared to a net loss of billion in  which included a million non cash goodwill impairment charge as well as recessionary conditions causing elevated credit losses 
net loss available to common shareholders in was million  or per average common diluted share  which compares favorably to the net loss available to common shareholders of billion  or per average common share in we are pleased with the diversity of our revenue sources and continued improvement in credit quality that is driving our improved financial performance 
although our results for the year are still not near the level where we would like them to be  we are pleased with the progress that we made over the course of and our position as we enter asset quality improvement was broad based in  with improvements in the provision for credit losses  net charge offs  npls  nonperforming assets  and early stage delinquencies 
the alll remains elevated by historical standards at of total loans  but declined basis points compared to december   in part due to a billion increase in period end loans coupled with a million decrease in the alll due to improving asset quality trends and a reduction in the risk profile of our loan portfolio 
while we experienced a reduction during the year in higher risk loan portfolio balances coupled with a broad based improvement in asset quality indicators  we are maintaining reserves that give consideration to the continued economic and real estate value uncertainty  but expect the alll to continue to trend downward at a pace consistent with improvements in credit quality 
the provision for credit losses decreased billion compared to while net charge offs declined during that time 
for the first quarter of  a stable to a modest decline in net charge offs from fourth quarter levels is expected 
total npls declined from as a result of charge offs  transfers to oreo  and reduced inflows into nonaccrual 
in addition  oreo declined during the year as we continue to aggressively dispose of properties once we have clear title 
we expect npls and nonperforming assets to continue to modestly decline in the near term  subject to economic conditions remaining stable or improving 
our accruing restructured loan portfolio  which is primarily related to mortgage and consumer loans  increased from the increase in accruing restructured loans is due to us taking proactive steps to modify loans in order to mitigate losses related to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty 
as a result of the modifications  the current portfolio exhibits strong payment performance with current on principal and interest payments at december  total growth in this portfolio has slowed during the latter half of as a result of a reduced inflow of newly delinquent loans and fewer modifications of more seriously delinquent loans 
a key leading indicator of asset quality  particularly for consumer loans  is early stage delinquencies 
this leading indicator of future asset quality has fallen significantly since the beginning of during this time  the economy and employment conditions have improved somewhat  but remain sluggish overall 
as a result  we do not expect further improvement in early stage delinquencies until economic conditions improve 
see additional discussion of credit and asset quality in the loans  allowance for credit losses  and nonperforming assets  sections of this md a 
our capital remained strong during  as evidenced by the increases in our capital ratios 
our tier capital ratio was  which was an increase from at december  our tier common equity ratio increased to compared to at december  our total capital ratio was stable at compared to at december  with strong capital  more clarity on capital standards  lower risk  ample liquidity  and improved earnings  we believe that we are well positioned to repay tarp at the appropriate time and in a fashion that makes the most sense from both shareholder and regulatory perspectives 
we have been and will continue to invest in our people and businesses to support future growth 
at the same time  we recognize the value of returning capital to shareholders  so in that regard  our priorities are repaying tarp and increasing the common dividend 
see additional discussion of our liquidity and capital position in the liquidity risk and capital resources sections of this md a 

table of contents during the year  average loans declined compared to the average loan balance  with the majority of the decline due to a reduction in our exposure to real estate related assets and commercial loans  as well as due to weak loan demand during the year 
while the total average balances have declined  our risk profile during the year has also improved as much of the decline has been in higher risk loans while growth in certain portfolios included the addition of lower risk loans that have attractive return and credit characteristics including an increase in government guaranteed loans 
despite recent soft loan demand we remain focused on extending credit to qualified borrowers as businesses and consumers work through the economic downturn 
during  we extended approximately billion in new loan originations  commitments  and renewals of commercial and consumer loans to our clients 
consumer and commercial deposits increased during the year and a positive shift in mix to lower cost deposits was prevalent as average balance increases were driven by lower cost noninterest bearing and money market accounts  which increased from by and  respectively  providing billion in combined average growth 
partially offsetting this growth was the decline in higher cost cd balances  which decreased an average of billion during due to the growth seen during in core deposits  our liquidity was enhanced 
additionally  this increase in low cost deposits has enabled us to reduce our higher cost funding sources  helping to drive significant reductions in our funding costs and improvement in net interest margin 
while we believe that a portion of the low cost deposit growth is attributable to clients holding higher levels of liquidity  we also believe that the growth is a direct result of investments that we have made to enhance our clients banking experience and to drive household market share growth 
our client focused revenue generation strategies  lower cost funding mix  improved asset quality  and continued expense management discipline contributed to improved operating trends as seen in higher net interest margin  higher core fee income  and controlled operating expenses 
total revenue  on an fte basis  increased compared to the prior year due to increased earning assets  stable fee based revenue  particularly investment banking revenue  and expanded net interest margin 
net interest income  on an fte basis  increased  compared to the increase in net interest income is due to lower funding costs  improved funding mix  and a reduction in long term debt 
as a result  our net interest margin increased to for the year ended december  from in noninterest income remained stable during  most notably due to increases in trading income offset by lower mortgage production income and lower service charges on deposit accounts 
noninterest expense decreased compared to  driven primarily by a noncash goodwill impairment charge taken during when excluding that impairment charge  noninterest expense increased in when compared to this increase was driven by increases in outside processing and software  marketing expenses  and compensation  as we sought to balance investments in our business with expense discipline 
consistent with our focus to invest in our people and grow the business  the increases in these categories related specifically to hiring in technology  mortgage  and client support areas  investing in client acquisition and risk management technology  and more broadly related to higher transaction volumes and additional investments focused on growth of our business 
partially offsetting these increases were declines in credit related costs of million 
we also experienced higher losses on debt extinguishment compared to as we proactively reduced our dependency on higher cost funding as a result of excess liquidity

net interest income margin net interest income  on an fte basis  was billion during  an increase of million  or  from this increase was driven mainly by a continued positive trend in net interest margin  which increased basis points to in from in earning asset yields declined basis points compared to from to  but the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points over the same period 
the biggest contributors to the net interest margin increase were growth in low cost deposits  lower rates paid on time deposits  and a reduction in higher cost long term debt coupled with a strong focus on loan pricing and higher commercial loan yields due to our commercial loan swap position 
these favorable margin contributors were partially offset by a reduction in residential mortgage loan yields and an increase in lower yielding securities 
we currently expect margin to be relatively stable in the near term 
risks to this expectation include the potential impacts of a prolonged low rate environment  yield curve flattening  a shift in deposit mix and volume  and loan pricing  while opportunities include continued deposit re pricing  further steepening of the yield curve  and lower nonperforming assets 
as 
table of contents a result of the consolidation of off balance sheet entities under new accounting guidance effective january   we realized an additional million in net interest income during the year 
the consolidations resulted in the re characterization of fees earned by certain of our newly consolidated entities from noninterest income to net interest income 
the effect of this consolidation resulted in a small dilutive impact to net interest margin 
previously  we recorded income on these off balance sheet entities primarily within investment banking income in noninterest income 
average earning assets decreased billion  or  from  while average interest bearing liabilities declined billion  or 
average loans decreased billion  or 
the decline in loans was attributable to a billion  or  reduction in commercial loans  a billion  or  reduction in real estate construction loans  a million  or  reduction in real estate commercial  and a million  or  reduction in real estate home equity loans 
these decreases were partially offset by increases of million  or  in consumer indirect loans  driven by purchases of high quality auto loan portfolios and million  or  in consumer direct loans 
average lhfs were billion  a decrease of billion  or  from the decrease in lhfs occurred as a result of decreased mortgage loan production refinance activity during the year  as well as a reduction in student loans held for sale due to recently enacted legislation eliminating our ability to originate and sell this product 
reduced demand in borrowing among credit worthy clients coupled with our efforts to reduce higher risk loan portfolios has resulted in an overall decrease in loan balances  which coupled with higher deposit levels  has led us to seek other investment opportunities  causing an increase in average securities afs 
average securities afs increased billion  or  due to increases of billion in us treasury and agency securities  million in mbs  and million in abs 
these positions were added during a declining rate environment resulting in a basis point decline in the weighted average yield on securities afs compared to see additional discussion in the securities available for sale section included in this md a for more information on the repositioning of our securities afs portfolio 
our loan portfolio yielded for the year  up basis points from since a large percentage of our commercial loans are variable rate indexed to one month libor  we utilize receive fixed pay floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk 
as of december   the outstanding notional balance of swaps was billion  which qualified as cash flow hedges on variable rate commercial loans compared to billion as of december  swap income increased from million in to million in  primarily due to increased realized gains on terminated swaps during and one month libor being lower in compared to while the underlying loans swapped to fixed rates are classified as both cre and commercial  all of the swap income is recorded as interest on commercial loans 
the classification of all swap income in the commercial loan category and the declining balance of average commercial loans produced an increase in reported commercial loan yields as compared to a decrease in underlying rate indices 
in addition  loan related interest income has been augmented by improved risk based pricing discipline 
average consumer and commercial deposits increased billion  or  in compared to this growth consisted of increases of billion  or  in money market accounts  billion  or  in now accounts  and billion  or  in demand deposits  partially offset by a decline of billion  or  in consumer and commercial time deposits 
low cost deposit growth was the result of marketing campaigns  competitive pricing and clients increased preference for more liquid products 
however  a portion of the deposit growth is related to reduced client demand for sweep accounts due to the low interest rate environment 
the overall growth in consumer and commercial deposits allowed for a reduction in other funding sources  including billion of long term debt and billion of brokered deposits 
overall  average interest bearing liabilities declined billion  or 
we continue to pursue deposit growth initiatives to increase our presence in specific markets within our footprint 
competition for deposits remains strong  and as a result  deposit pricing pressure remains across our footprint 
despite these challenging market conditions  we have used a combination of regional and product specific pricing initiatives to balance margin and volume  while still growing our average deposit balances 
while we acknowledge some of this growth is seasonal and influenced by the current economic environment  we also believe that the growth is the direct result of investments that we have made to enhance our clients banking experience and to drive household and market share growth 
during  the interest rate environment was characterized by flat short term rates and lower medium and long term rates  resulting in a flatter yield curve versus more specifically  the fed funds target rate averaged  unchanged from last year  the prime rate averaged  unchanged from last year  one month libor averaged  a decrease of basis points  three month libor averaged  a decrease of basis points  five year swaps averaged  a decrease of basis points  and ten year swaps averaged  a decrease of basis points

investment banking income increased by million  or  versus the year ended december  strong loan syndication  bond originations  and mergers and acquisitions revenues drove the increase  which was partially offset by the re characterization of fees earned by certain of our newly consolidated entities from noninterest income to net interest income 
trading account profits losses and commissions improved during the year ended december  by million  primarily due to mark to market valuations on our public debt and related hedges carried at fair value 
we recorded valuation gains of million for the year december  on our public debt versus losses of million during the year ended december  these market valuation changes were driven by changes in our credit spreads and changes in interest rates 
additionally  as liquidity returned to the market for certain illiquid assets  including ars  net market valuation adjustments and net gains on the disposition of such assets improved by million versus the year ended december  other core trading results were essentially flat year over year 
we do not currently believe that the legislative and regulatory changes related to derivatives will have a material impact on our revenue related to trading account activities 
net securities gains increased by million versus the year ended december  the gains were the result of certain portfolio repositioning initiatives undertaken during see securities available for sale in this md a for further discussion of our portfolio repositioning initiatives 
additionally  we recorded million in credit related otti losses on securities afs during the year ended december  versus million in losses during the year ended december  card fees increased by million  or  versus the year ended december  card fees increased due to check card interchange fees 
growth was driven by household expansion  higher product penetration  and increasing consumer usage patterns which will help offset the potential impact of lower interchange rates 
however  the federal reserve s recent proposal on debit card interchange could significantly impact this source of revenue going forward 
for  we recorded approximately million of interchange income  our current estimate is that provisions of the dodd frank act may cause future annual interchange income to decline by as much as from levels  beginning in the second half of however  this estimate is based upon the current proposal and does not take into account any actions that we will pursue to alter our fee structure to clients or to alter the costs of operating the debit card business 

table of contents trust and investment management income increased by million  or  versus the year ended december  the increase was attributable to higher market valuations on managed equity assets and fixed income asset inflows  partially offset by lower money market mutual fund revenue 
mortgage servicing related income increased million  or  versus the year ended december   due to higher servicing fees  partially offset by the negative impact of increased prepayments during mortgage production related income decreased by million  or  versus the year ended december  the decrease was due to a billion  or  decline in loan production 
the provision for mortgage repurchase related losses for the year ended december  increased by to million versus million for the year ended december  as of december   the reserve for mortgage repurchase losses was million  an increase of million versus the prior year 
the increase in the reserve was due to a continued increase in repurchase requests during and expected elevated levels for the foreseeable future 
we expect future repurchase related losses and reserves will be largely driven by the volume of repurchase requests received from the gses  which have exhibited considerable month to month volatility 
to date  the majority of our repurchase requests have been associated with and vintages  which produce higher losses 
we expect that normal seasoning patterns for origination vintages  over time  will shift new repurchase requests to newer production vintages which have a lower risk profile 
as that occurs  we expect lower aggregate request volumes and lower loss frequencies and severities  as the newer vintages exhibit more favorable characteristics  such as higher ficos and lower original ltvs  as they were originated during or after periods that experienced the most significant home price depreciation 
if our assumptions are correct  we expect a favorable impact on noninterest income from curtailed mortgage repurchases losses in with respect to non agency loan sales  we have sold billion of such loans since  with an insignificant amount of such sales occurring after of this amount  we estimate that billion is still outstanding 
in addition to outstanding loans  our repurchase exposure includes loans no longer outstanding due to foreclosures or short sales 
to date  we have received a modest number of repurchase requests regarding such loans  which have not resulted in any material repurchase related losses 
while our losses have not been significant  we have been factoring our non agency loss experience into our mortgage repurchase reserve process 
however  if such repurchase requests increase materially in the future  we could suffer additional losses

service charges on deposit accounts decreased by million  or  versus the year ended december  the decreases were attributable to the implementation of regulation e changes and a voluntary decision to eliminate overdraft fees on very small individual transactions  as well as reducing the maximum number of daily overdraft fees 
the voluntary changes were in place for the entire third quarter while the regulation e changes became effective in the middle of the third quarter 
until clients have fully exercised their opt in opportunity and reacted to our client satisfaction initiatives around overdraft fees  we expect service charge income to decline over the next few quarters  with the reduction gradually moderating over time 
the effects of adopting regulation e and our voluntary overdraft changes impacted our fourth quarter results and are expected to have a full year impact within the range of to million 
this estimate  however  does not consider any mitigating actions that we may take 
retail investment services income decreased by million  or  versus the year ended december  the decrease was attributable to declines to fixed annuity revenue  partially offset by increased recurring brokerage revenue linked to the equity markets and increased transactional revenue from variable annuity and mutual fund sales 
other income increased by million  or  versus the year ended december  the increase was largely attributable to a million reduction in net losses recognized on certain private equity investments as compared to the prior year

the increase in expenses excluding the prior year goodwill impairment charge was reflective of our desire to balance investments in the business with our expense discipline 
specifically  the increase in core noninterest expense was primarily attributable to higher outside processing and software costs  increased marketing and customer development costs  higher consulting and legal expenses  higher personnel expense  and increased net loss on debt extinguishment  partially offset by a decline in regulatory expenses and credit related costs 
credit related costs decreased by million  or  versus the year ended december  the decrease was due to decline in mortgage reinsurance losses of million  partially offset by an increase in other real estate expenses of million 
mortgage reinsurance expenses relate to the activities of our mortgage reinsurance guaranty subsidiary  twin rivers  whose loss exposure arises from third party mortgage insurers transferring a portion of their first loss exposure when losses by mortgage origination year exceed certain thresholds 
since the first quarter of  our exposure to reinsurance losses has been limited to incremental insurance premium contributions  which has caused the steady decline in this expense as we ceased writing new contracts in other real estate expense increased compared to primarily due to an increase in net losses on the sale of oreo properties 
regulatory assessments decreased by million  or  compared to the year ended december   attributable to the decline in fdic insurance premiums  primarily due to the payment of the special assessment levied on all banks during the second quarter of  offset by higher deposit balances in with respect to the current fdic deposit insurance 
table of contents proposal  the calculation will be based on net assets  not on deposits  which will raise our assessment base beginning in the second quarter of  however  we expect that over time  the higher assessment base will be mitigated as improving operating trends  such as asset quality and earnings  favorably impact future premium calculations 
while all of this may lead to some volatility in our quarterly expense  we do not expect a significant increase in our expense base 
personnel expense increased by million  or  versus the year ended december  the increase was attributable to higher salaries  incentive compensation  and contract labor expenses  offset by a reduction in pension and other postretirement benefit expenses as a result of improved performance in the underlying plan assets in full time equivalent employees increased by  compared to december   with the majority of the increase resulting from hiring within our technology  mortgage  retail branches  and client support areas 
these increases are a direct result of our commitment to investing in our business 
higher incentive compensation expense resulted from the strong revenue performance of certain business lines during outside processing and software costs increased by million  or  versus the year ended december   related to increased transaction volumes along with client acquisition and risk management technology investments made to enhance the client experience 
marketing and customer development costs increased by million  or  versus the year ended december  the increase was attributable to higher promotional and advertising spending and more broadly as a result of investments made during the year to aid in the overall growth of our business 
consulting and legal expenses increased by million  or  versus the year ended december  the increase was attributable to increases in litigation fees and expenses  coupled with an increase in consulting activities 
net losses on debt extinguishment increased by million versus the year ended december  net losses on debt extinguishment in the current year were primarily due to early termination fees on the extinguishments of billion in fhlb borrowings  in addition to the fees paid to repurchase million of our debt in a tender offer during the third quarter 
net losses in the prior year primarily resulted from early termination fees for fhlb advances repaid during the year  net of gains on extinguishment of other long term debt 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income taxes 
in  the provision for income taxes was a benefit of million  compared to a benefit of million in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by net favorable permanent tax items such as tax exempt interest income and tax credits significantly exceeding the positive pre tax earnings 
the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the pre tax loss and further increased by net favorable permanent tax items such as tax exempt interest income  federal tax credits and the release of utbs related to the completion of audit examinations by several taxing authorities  it was  however  reduced by a non tax deductible goodwill impairment 
for additional information on the reconciliation of the effective tax rate  refer to note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements 
loans as discussed in note  significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements  we recently adopted new accounting guidance that requires additional disclosures about the credit quality of our loan portfolios and the credit reserves held against them 
these new disclosures are intended to describe the nature of credit risk inherent in our loan portfolio  determine how we analyze and assess that risk in arriving at an adequate and appropriate alll  and explain the changes in the alll and reasons for those changes 
additionally  the new disclosures are required to be made on a disaggregated basis by loan portfolio segment and or by type of loan 
a portfolio segment is defined as the level at which we develop and document our method for determining our alll 
loan types are further categories of our portfolio segments 
in conjunction with adopting the new accounting guidance  we have adjusted prior year loan classifications to align with the current year loan classifications 
while the reclassification had no effect on the carrying value of our lhfi or lhfs  sec regulations require us  in some instances  to present five years of comparable data where trend information may be deemed relevant  in which case we have provided the pre adoption loan classifications due to the inability to restate all prior periods under the new loan classifications 

table of contents under the post adoption classification  we have included commercial and construction loans secured by owner occupied properties as part of commercial and industrial loans  as the primary source of loan repayment for owner occupied properties is business income and not real estate operations

loans held for investment lhfi increased by billion  or  during the year ended december  the increase was attributable to an increase in consumer loans  partially offset by a decrease in commercial loans 
residential loans were relatively flat year over year  although the risk profile of the residential profile improved during the period 
commercial loans decreased by billion  or  during the year ended december   which was largely attributable to a decline in commercial construction loans 
commercial construction loans decreased by billion  or  primarily as a result of our efforts to reduce risk levels by aggressively managing existing construction exposure and significantly limiting new production 
partially offsetting this decline was growth from our asset backed commercial paper conduit  which we consolidated effective january  as a result of new accounting guidance 
line of credit utilization rates among our corporate clients have stabilized  although they remain low overall 
we continue to expect that broad based commercial loan growth will return with an improving economy 
however  the evidence to date suggests that growth will occur gradually 
as this occurs  we will continue to grow commercial loans in client segments and products that offer opportunities 
residential loans increased by million  or less than  during the year ended december  however  the composition of the residential loan portfolio changed during the year  as we continued to reduce our exposure to higher risk loans 
nonguaranteed residential mortgages declined by billion  or  due to paydowns and charge offs 
additionally  we reduced our home equity loan portfolio by billion  or  and our residential construction portfolio by million  or  while increasing the amount of government guaranteed mortgages by billion  or  as part of our efforts to reduce overall risk and further diversify our loan portfolio 

table of contents consumer loans increased by billion  or  during the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to a billion increase in guaranteed student loans  which included the billion impact of consolidating a student loan trust during the year  and a billion increase in indirect consumer loans  which included purchases of billion in automobile loans during the year 
we have been opportunistic with consumer loan purchases completed to date  as we have found them to have attractive returns and credit characteristics

asset quality our overall asset quality has improved significantly since december   as nonperforming assets  nonaccrual loans and net charge offs all declined compared to the prior year 

table of contents the commercial and industrial loan portfolio continues to perform well  as evidenced by improving trends in our credit quality indicators 
delinquencies  net charge offs  and nonperforming loans all decreased year over year within this portfolio 
under the post adoption classification  our commercial real estate portfolio consists of investor owned properties 
we believe that our investor owned portfolio is appropriately diversified by borrower  geography  and property type 
we typically underwrite commercial projects to credit standards that are more stringent than historical cmbs guidelines 
given the stresses in the commercial real estate market  we have performed a thorough analysis of our commercial real estate portfolio in order to identify loans with an increased risk of default 
where appropriate  we have taken prudent actions with the client to strengthen our credit position 
these actions reflect market terms and structures and are intended to improve the client s financial ability to perform 
impaired loans are assessed relative to the client s and guarantor s  if any  abilities to service the debt  the loan terms  and the value of the property 
these factors are taken into consideration when formulating our alll through our credit risk rating and or specific reserving processes 
we believe the current commercial real estate cycle is not over  and we expect some elevated risk and variability in performance through the credit cycle 
we continue to believe that this portfolio will perform comparatively well given its composition  the quality of our underwriting  and our ongoing management disciplines 
for our commercial construction portfolios  we continue to be proactive in our credit monitoring and management processes to provide early warning for problem loans 
for example  we use an expanded liquidity and contingency analysis to provide a thorough view of borrower capacity and their ability to service obligations in a steep market decline 
we also have strict limits and exposure caps on specific projects and borrowers for risk diversification 
due to the lack of new construction projects and the completion of many that were previously started  the aggregate amount of interest reserves that we are obligated to fund has declined from prior periods and are not considered material relative to total loans outstanding 
we expect quarterly variability in losses as we continue to work through the remaining risk in this runoff portfolio 
the residential mortgages portfolio continued to show overall improvement in terms of declines in npls and net charge offs  as well as stable but continued elevated delinquencies 
certain products within this portfolio are insured through third party pool level insurance  however  the dollar amount of claims received has declined during and we expect fewer claim payments going forward as we approach the insurance stop loss limits 
our outlook for the residential mortgage portfolio  based on past delinquency trends  is for reduced frequency of default over the next few quarters 
we expect home prices to remain soft overall  trending down in some markets and stable to modestly up in other markets 
we believe that lower expected default frequency and moderating loss severity will produce stable to modestly declining nonperforming loan and charge off levels over the near term 
asset quality in the home equity portfolio was slightly improved during the year  while higher risk balances continued to decline 
net charge offs  early stage delinquencies  and nonperforming loans all showed modest year over year declines 
runoff in this portfolio has been concentrated in the higher risk portfolios  where no new production has occurred and little to no line availability exists 
the residential construction portfolio also showed improvement in terms of declines in npls and net charge offs 
net charge offs are expected to remain elevated and uneven as we work through the remainder of the risk in this portfolio 
further  while there may be some variability  we generally expect this trend of declining nonperforming loans to continue as we aggressively pursue workouts and transition foreclosed assets to oreo  and ultimately  disposition 
for the consumer portfolios  asset quality improved during the year 
for all consumer portfolios  the net charge off ratio declined in versus likewise  early stage delinquencies declined across all portfolios except student loans  which are largely government guaranteed 
meanwhile  the level of nonperforming consumer loans remained relatively flat 
we believe that our loan portfolio is well diversified by product  client  and geography throughout our footprint 
however  our loan portfolio may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers  certain types of collateral  certain types of industries  certain loan products  or certain regions of the country 
see note  concentrations of credit risk  to the consolidated financial statements for more information

the unfunded commitments reserve is separately recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
this ratio is calculated using the alll 
for this ratio  million and million at december  and  respectively  of lhfi carried at fair value were excluded from year end loans 
the alll decreased by million  or  during the year ended december  the decrease in alll reflects improvements in asset quality during the year  partially mitigated by the continued uncertainty in the overall economic outlook 
the ratio of the alll to total npls increased to as of december  from as of december  the increase in this ratio was attributable to the billion decrease in npls  partially offset by the decline in alll 
the decrease in npls was due to charge offs recognized  the migration of loans to oreo  and reduced inflows into nonaccrual status 
see additional discussion regarding npl trends in the nonperforming assets section of the md a 

table of contents the variables most impacting the alll continue to be unemployment  residential real estate property values  and the variability and relative strength of the housing market 
at this point in the cycle  we expect the alll to continue to trend downward at a pace consistent with improvements in credit quality and overall economic conditions 
as of december   the allowance to period end loans ratio was  down basis points from december  loan loss reserves are declining on both an absolute and relative basis for three primary reasons 
first  higher risk portfolio balances continue to decline 
second  charge offs associated with some of the higher risk portfolios  such as construction  are reducing reserves 
third  emerging risks have moderated 
the loan production that has replaced recent runoff and charge offs is higher quality commercial and consumer loans  as well as government guaranteed student and mortgage loans 
government guaranteed loans represented of our total lhfi portfolio at december  versus of the total lhfi portfolio at december  the reserve for unfunded commitments was million as of december   a decrease of million from december  the decrease in the reserve was attributed to improved credit quality related to certain commercial and large corporate borrowers and secondarily as a result of a decrease in off balance sheet exposure

during the second quarter of  the company revised its method of calculating this ratio to include  within the period end loan amount  only loans measured at amortized cost 
previously  period end loans included loans measured at fair value or the lower of cost or market 
the company believes this is an improved method of calculation due to the fact that the alll relates solely to the loans measured at amortized cost 
loans measured at fair value or locom that have been excluded from the prior period calculation were million  which increased the calculation by approximately basis points as of december  amounts excluded in years prior to were immaterial and resulted in no basis point change in the respective calculation

factors which could affect general asset quality and charge off levels include macro or regional economic volatility  specific borrower performance  and trends within specific sectors  such as construction and commercial real estate 
total charge offs for the year ended december  declined for the majority of our loan portfolios compared to the same period in however  commercial real estate charge offs increased during the latter half of as specific loans were resolved 
given continuing stress in this segment  the timing and amount of future commercial real estate charge offs will remain variable 
for the first quarter of  a stable to a modest decline in net charge offs from fourth quarter levels is expected 

table of contents provision for credit losses the total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments 
the provision for loan losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate an appropriate and adequate alll 
for the year ended december   the provision for loan losses decreased by billion  or  to billion  compared to billion for the year ended december  the decrease in the provision continued a trend of declining loan loss provisions over the last year  reflecting an improvement in overall asset quality and a gradually improving economy 
for the year ended december   the provision for unfunded commitments decreased by million to a million benefit  compared to an million provision for the year ended december  the provision decrease for the year is primarily attributable to improved credit quality related to certain commercial and large corporate borrowers and secondarily as a result of a decrease in unfunded commitment exposure 
although net charge offs and provisions have recently declined  and despite indications of an improving economy  we expect net charge offs and the provision for loan losses to remain elevated until we experience a sustained improvement in economic conditions 
we believe the amount of future changes in the alll remains highly correlated to unemployment levels  changes in home prices within our markets  especially florida  as well as sustained improvement in our portfolio specific asset quality indicators

nonperforming assets decreased by billion  or  during the year ended december  the decrease was attributable to a billion reduction in npls as a result of our problem resolution efforts and the continued trend of lower npl inflows 
nonperforming commercial loans decreased by million  or  during the year ended december   primarily as a result of a million decrease in commercial construction npls and a million decrease in commercial and industrial npls  partially offset by a million increase in commercial real estate npls 
the overall decrease was driven primarily by net charge offs of existing nonperforming commercial loans  partially offset by the migration of delinquent commercial loans to nonaccrual status 
we believe that the increase in commercial real estate npls is related to a continuation of the current commercial real estate correction  and we expect some variability in the performance as this cycle plays out 
nonperforming residential loans decreased by million  or  during the year ended december   primarily as a result of a million decrease in nonguaranteed residential mortgage npls 
the decrease was attributable to lower inflows of npls  net charge offs  and the sale of certain residential npls in the second quarter of 
table of contents nonperforming consumer loans decreased by million  or  during the year ended december   primarily as a result of a million decrease in indirect consumer npls

upon foreclosure  these properties were re evaluated and  if necessary  written down to their then current estimated value  less costs to sell 
further declines in home prices could result in additional losses on these properties 
we are actively managing and disposing of these foreclosed assets to minimize future losses 
other repossessed assets decreased by million  or  during the year ended december  the decrease is largely attributable to impairment charges and sales of repossessed assets during the year  partially offset by additional repossessions during the year

review of foreclosure practices we have observed an increase in the amount of time it takes us to foreclose upon residential real estate collateral in certain states  primarily florida  which we believe is attributable to delays in the foreclosure process 
we recently conducted an assessment of our foreclosure process in all states 
our review indicated approximately  files  or less than of active foreclosure proceedings  contained documents with technical issues in the foreclosure complaint verification  affidavit preparation and notary processes  which we describe in greater detail below 
we do not believe that any potential deficiency identified violated applicable law 
below  we explain the issues we identified  what we have done and what we are doing to remediate potential deficiencies identified  and our expectations as to the effect these remedial efforts will have on our financial results 
as explained below  we do not expect these concerns to have a material adverse affect upon our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
filing requirements in florida require a foreclosure complaint to be verified when filed with a court 
in this context  verified means that the complaint includes a signed statement to the effect that the signer has read the document and believes the facts alleged in the complaint to be true and correct to the best of the signer s knowledge and belief 
similarly  filing requirements in some judicial foreclosure states  including florida  require an affidavit of indebtedness  or a sworn statement  which includes  among other things  a description of the loan  a statement that the loan is in default  the current principal balance and accrued interest  and an itemization of the amounts owed 
in many states  affidavits  as well as certain other documents prepared and submitted in the foreclosure processes  are required to be notarized 
our review identified instances in which the verified complaints may not have been fully reviewed by the signer prior to the filing of the complaint 
in those instances  the signer relied upon review work performed by others 
similarly  with a population of affidavits of indebtedness  our review indicated certain circumstances where officers signed affidavits based 
table of contents upon a review performed by a foreclosure processor  rather than based on their review 
as to the process of notarizing documents  while signatures were notarized by notaries who worked on the same floor and in the same general area as the signer  and while the notary had personal knowledge and awareness of the person who signed the documents  the process could be improved 
we have completed notary training and the process is now more regimented and tightly managed 
to address all issues identified  we have elected to replace any documents containing one or more of the issues identified on file with a court in any pending foreclosure action not yet reduced to judgment 
all replacement documentation has been and will be prepared in compliance with all applicable rules and required formalities 
we estimate this process of resubmitting affidavits will be substantially completed during the first quarter of once these affidavits are resubmitted  there may be prolonged adversary proceedings that delay certain foreclosure sales 
we are undertaking similar remedial action in non judicial foreclosure states as necessary and appropriate 
given the time required to bring a foreclosure filing to a judicial hearing  which exceeds one year in many jurisdictions  we expect that our remediation efforts will delay only a relatively small number of foreclosure proceedings or sales 
also  we expect the cost of resubmitting legal documents to be modest 
however  any delay in the foreclosure process will adversely affect us by increasing our expenses related to carrying such assets  such as taxes  insurance  and other carrying costs  and exposes us to losses as a result of potential additional declines in the value of such collateral 
nevertheless  we believe these additional costs will have an immaterial effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
in addition to our own review  various regulators  including the federal reserve  have conducted a review of our mortgage servicing practices  as well as all other large servicers in the us we expect these regulators to ask us and other servicers to consent to an order possibly related to i the filing of affidavits without personal knowledge  ii the filing of improperly notarized documents  iii failing to ensure that the promissory note and all necessary mortgage documents were properly endorsed or assigned and  if necessary  in the possession of the appropriate party at the time foreclosure proceedings were instituted  iv failing to devote sufficient financial  staffing  and managerial resources  and v failing to develop related processes and operational controls to prevent these problems 
we expect that such a consent order will require us to implement substantial additional operational processes and reviews within a certain time frame 
we also expect that such regulators may seek civil monetary penalties at a later time 
at this time  we do not know the amount of such penalties  the extent of such required actions  or whether other regulators and law enforcement agencies will seek other remedies 
regulators and other law enforcement authorities in certain states and the united states department of justice and other federal agencies have stated they are investigating whether mortgage servicers have had irregularities in their foreclosure practices 
those investigations  as well as any other governmental or regulatory scrutiny of our foreclosure processes  could result in fines  penalties or other equitable remedies and result in significant legal costs in responding to governmental investigations and possible litigation 
while we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any delay in foreclosure sales  or any issues that may arise as a result of alleged irregularities with respect to previously completed foreclosure activities  we may be subject to additional borrower and non borrower litigation  investor scrutiny as to compliance with contracts  and governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to our past and current foreclosure activities 
this scrutiny may extend beyond our pending foreclosure matters to issues arising out of alleged irregularities with respect to previously completed foreclosure activities 
we expect that our costs will increase in as a result of the additional resources necessary to perform the foreclosure process assessment  revise affidavit filings and make any other operational changes 
this may result in higher noninterest expense  including higher servicing costs and legal expenses  in our mortgage line of business 
in addition  process changes required as a result of our assessment could increase our default servicing costs over the longer term 
finally  the time to complete foreclosure sales temporarily may increase  and this may result in an increase in nonperforming assets and servicing advances and may impact the collectability of such advances and the value of our mortgage servicing rights asset 
accordingly  delays in foreclosure sales  including any delays beyond those currently anticipated  our process enhancements  and any issues that may arise out of alleged irregularities in our foreclosure processes could increase the costs associated with our mortgage operations

restructured loans in order to maximize the collection of loan balances  we evaluate troubled loans on a case by case basis to determine if a loan modification would be appropriate 
we pursue loan modifications when there is a reasonable chance that an appropriate modification would allow our client to continue servicing the debt 
for loans secured by residential real estate  if the client demonstrates a loss of income such that the client cannot reasonably support even a modified loan  we may pursue short sales and or deed in lieu arrangements 
for loans secured by income producing commercial properties  we perform a rigorous and ongoing review that is programmatic in nature 
we review a number of factors  including cash flows  loan structures  collateral values  and guarantees  to identify loans within our income producing commercial loan portfolio that are most likely to experience distress 
based on our review of these factors and our assessment of overall risk  we evaluate the benefits of proactively initiating discussions with our clients to improve a loan s risk profile 
in some cases  we may renegotiate terms of their loans so that they have a higher likelihood of continuing to perform 
to date  we have restructured loans in a variety of ways to help our clients service their debt and to mitigate the potential for additional losses 
the primary restructuring methods being offered to our residential clients are reductions in interest rates and extensions in terms 
for commercial loans  the primary restructuring method is the extensions of terms 
accruing loans with modifications deemed to be economic concessions resulting from borrower difficulties are reported as tdrs 
nonaccruing loans that are modified and demonstrate a history of repayment performance in accordance with their modified terms are reclassified to accruing restructured status  typically after six months of repayment performance 
see note  significant accounting policies  and note  loans  to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our accounting policy for tdrs 
accruing restructured loans increased by million  or  during the year ended december  the increase in accruing restructured loans was attributed to a general increase in the number of loan modifications  as well as an increase in the number of previously nonaccruing restructured loans meeting sustained repayment performance criteria and therefore 
table of contents transferring to accrual status 
nonaccruing restructured loans increased by million  or  during the year ended december   reflecting the overall increase in loan modifications despite such loans not yet meeting the repayment performance criteria 
interest income on restructured loans that have met sustained performance criteria and have been returned to accruing status is recognized according to the terms of the restructuring 
such interest income recorded was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
if all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms  estimated interest income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  would have been recorded

we note that some restructurings may not ultimately result in the complete collection of principal and interest as modified by the terms of the restructuring  culminating in default  which could result in additional incremental losses 
these potential incremental losses have been factored into our overall alll estimate 
the level of re defaults will likely be affected by future economic conditions 
generally  once a residential loan becomes a tdr  it is probable that the loan will likely continue to be reported as tdr until it is ultimately repaid in full  or foreclosed and sold 
at december   specific reserves included in the alll for residential tdrs were million 
in addition  we have recorded approximately million in charge offs on residential tdrs and recorded million in mark to market losses on residential tdrs carried at fair value  life to date 
selected financial instruments carried at fair value certain financial instruments such as trading securities  derivatives  and securities afs are required to be carried at fair value 
companies are also permitted to elect to carry specific financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
reasons that a company may choose to elect fair value include i to more accurately align its financial performance with the economic value of actively traded or hedged assets or liabilities  ii to mitigate the non economic earnings volatility caused from financial assets and financial liabilities being carried at different bases of accounting and or iii to more accurately portray the active and dynamic management of a company s balance sheet 
based on our balance sheet management strategies and objectives  we have elected to carry certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value  these instruments include all  or a portion  of the following long term debt  lhfs  brokered deposits  msrs  trading assets  and a small portion of lhfi

trading loans increased during the year ended december  primarily as a result of the resumption of our trs business 
there were no trs related trading loans outstanding as of december   but as of december   the business had million in outstanding trading loans 
the increase in corporate debt securities was due to market movements and normal client business activity

the size of the securities portfolio  at fair value  was billion as of december   a decrease of billion  or  versus december  changes in the size and composition of the portfolio during the year reflect our efforts to maintain a high quality portfolio and manage our interest rate risk profile 
these changes included increasing the size and extending the duration of the us treasury position  decreasing the agency mbs positions  reducing federal agency securities  reducing the municipal position by selling lower rated securities  and purchasing high quality abs backed by newly originated consumer automobile loans

table of contents for the year ended december   the average yield on a fte basis for the securities afs portfolio declined to compared to for the year ended december  the yield decline was largely due to security maturities  prepayments  and sales  with the proceeds generally reinvested at current lower yields 
additionally  the portfolio s yield was impacted by the purchase of lower yielding us treasury securities in late the portfolio s effective duration increased to as of december  from as of december  effective duration is a measure of price sensitivity of a bond portfolio to an immediate change in market interest rates  taking into consideration embedded options

the amount of ars recorded in the securities afs portfolio totaled million as of december  and million as of december  included in ars are tax exempt municipal securities as well as student loan abs 
due to the high quality and highly liquid nature of the portfolio  we have the flexibility to respond to changes in the economic environment and take actions as opportunities arise to manage our interest rate risk profile and balance liquidity against investment returns 
going forward  we will continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce our risk to a further steepening of the yield curve 
over the longer term  we continue to expect that a growing economy will result in loan balances trending up and deposits trending down 
accordingly  we may eventually decrease the size of our securities portfolio in response to loan growth and or declining deposits 
investment in common shares of the coca cola company background we have owned common shares of coke since  when one of our predecessor institutions participated in the underwriting of coke s ipo and received common shares of coke in lieu of underwriting fees 
these shares have grown in value over the past years and have been classified as securities afs  with unrealized gains  net of tax  recorded as a component of shareholders equity 
because of the low accounting cost basis of these shares  we have accumulated significant unrealized gains in shareholders equity 
as of december   we owned million coke shares with an accounting cost basis of  and a fair market value of billion 
we commenced a comprehensive balance sheet review initiative in early in an effort to improve liquidity and capital efficiency 
as part of this initiative  we began to formally evaluate the capital efficiency of our holdings of coke common shares  as we were prohibited from including the market value of our investment in coke common shares in tier capital in accordance with federal reserve capital adequacy rules 
as a result of this initiative  at various times during and we sold and made a charitable contribution of all but million shares of our coke stock 
additionally  during the second half of  we executed the agreements on the remaining million shares that we owned 
our primary objective in executing these transactions was to optimize the benefits we obtained from our long term holding of this asset  including the capital treatment by bank regulators 
we entered into the agreements  which were comprised of two variable forward agreements and share forward agreements effective july  with a major  unaffiliated financial institution the counterparty collectively covering our million coke shares 
under the agreements  we must deliver to the counterparty at settlement of the variable forward agreements either a variable number of coke common shares or a cash payment in lieu of such shares 
the counterparty is obligated to settle the agreements for no less than approximately per share  or approximately billion in the aggregate the minimum proceeds 
the share forward agreements give us the right  but not the obligation  to sell to the counterparty  at prevailing market prices at the time of settlement  any of the million coke common shares that are not delivered to the counterparty in settlement of the variable forward agreements 
the agreements effectively ensure that we will be able to sell our million coke common shares at a price no less than approximately per share  while permitting us to participate in future appreciation in the value of the coke common shares up to approximately per share and approximately per share  under each of the respective agreements 

table of contents during the terms of the agreements  and until we sell the million coke common shares  we generally will continue to receive dividends as declared and paid by coke and will have the right to vote such shares 
however  the amounts payable to us under the agreements will be adjusted if actual dividends are not equal to amounts expected at the inception of the derivative 
contemporaneously with entering into the agreements  the counterparty invested in senior unsecured promissory notes issued by the bank and suntrust collectively  the notes in a private placement in an aggregate principal amount equal to the minimum proceeds 
the notes carry stated maturities of approximately ten years from the effective date and bear interest at one month libor plus a fixed spread 
the counterparty pledged the notes to us and we pledged the million coke common shares to the counterparty  securing each entity s respective obligations under the agreements 
the pledged coke common shares are held by an independent third party custodian and the counterparty is prohibited under the agreements from selling  pledging  assigning or otherwise using the pledged coke common shares in its business 
we generally may not prepay the notes 
the interest rate on the notes will be reset upon or after the settlement of the agreements  either through a remarketing process  or based upon dealer quotations 
in the event of an unsuccessful remarketing of the notes  we would be required to collateralize the notes and the maturity of the notes may accelerate to the first anniversary of the settlement of the agreements 
however  we presently believe that it is substantially certain that the notes will be successfully remarketed 
the agreements carry scheduled settlement terms of approximately seven years from the effective date 
however  we have the option to terminate the agreements earlier with the approval of the federal reserve 
the agreements may also terminate earlier upon certain events of default  extraordinary events regarding coke and other typical termination events 
upon such early termination  there could be exit costs or gains  such as certain breakage fees including an interest rate make whole amount  associated with both the agreements and the notes 
such costs or gains may be material but cannot be determined at the present time due to the unlikely occurrence of such events and the number of variables that are unknown 
however  the payment of such costs  if any  will not result in us receiving less than the minimum proceeds from the agreements 
we expect to sell all of the coke common shares upon settlement of the agreements  either under the terms of the agreements or in another market transaction 
see note  derivative financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the transactions 
the federal reserve determined that we may include in tier capital  as of the effective date of the agreements  an amount equal to the minimum proceeds minus the deferred tax liability associated with the ultimate sale of the million coke common shares 
accordingly  the agreements resulted in an increase in tier capital during the third quarter of of approximately million

table of contents accounts which increased billion  or 
the increase was partially offset by declines in consumer time and other time deposit account balances which decreased by billion  or 
these positive trends resulted from our continued marketing efforts  pricing discipline in the context of a low and declining rate environment  improving operational execution  as well as an industry wide preference for greater liquidity 
consumer and commercial deposit growth remains one of our key initiatives 
during  we focused on growing our client base  number of households  and deposit share while managing the rates we pay on our deposits 
overall growth was accomplished through a judicious use of competitive rates in select products and select geographies 
we experienced mixed results across our regions due to competitive forces  unusual deposit flows resulting from the fdic s tagp  and concentrations of time deposit clients 
other initiatives to attract deposits included innovative product and features offerings  enhanced programs and initiatives  customer targeted offers  and advanced analytics that leverage product offerings with customer segmentation 
we continued to leverage the live solid 
bank solid 
brand to improve our visibility in the marketplace 
it is designed to speak to what is important to clients in the current environment and to inspire customer loyalty and capitalize on some of the opportunities presented by the new banking landscape 
we continue to manage judiciously through the implications of impending or executed regulatory change and evaluate the impacts to our deposit products and clients

the guidelines weigh assets and off balance sheet risk exposures risk weighted assets according to predefined classifications  creating a base from which to compare capital levels 
tier capital primarily includes realized equity and qualified preferred instruments  less purchase accounting intangibles such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles 
total capital consists of tier capital and tier capital  which includes qualifying portions of subordinated debt  alll up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets  and of the unrealized gain on equity securities 
both the company and the bank are subject to a minimum tier capital and total capital ratios of and  respectively  of risk weighted assets 
to be considered well capitalized  ratios of and  respectively  are required 
additionally  the company and the bank are subject to tier leverage ratio requirements  which measures tier capital against average assets for leverage purposes  which is a regulatory exposure measure with adjustments similar to those used to calculate tier capital 
the minimum and well capitalized ratios are and  respectively 
in september  the bcbs announced new regulatory capital requirements commonly referred to as basel iii aimed at substantially strengthening existing capital requirements  through a combination of higher minimum capital requirements  new capital conservation buffers and more stringent definitions of capital and exposure 
basel iii would impose a new common equity requirement of  comprised of a minimum of plus a capital conservation buffer of 
the transition period for banks to meet the revised common equity requirement will begin in  with full implementation in our current proforma tier common ratio is in excess of  which is above the basel iii requirement 
the bcbs has also stated that from time to time it may require an additional  counter cyclical capital buffer on top of basel iii standards 
we intend to comply with those requirements when announced as they may apply to us 
the new rule also proposes the deduction of certain assets in measuring tier capital 
it is anticipated that us regulators will adopt new regulatory capital requirements similar to those proposed by the bcbs and the new requirements are anticipated to be phased in over the period from to we will continue to monitor the federal reserve s implementation of the basel iii standards 
the composition of our capital elements is likely to be impacted by the dodd frank act in at least two ways over the next several years 
first  the dodd frank act authorizes the federal reserve to enact prudential capital requirements which may require greater capital levels than presently required and which may vary among financial institutions based on size  risk  complexity  and other factors 
we expect the federal reserve to use this authority to implement the basel iii capital requirements  although this authority is not limited to the basel iii requirements 
see additional discussion of newly proposed basel iii capital rules in the executive overview section of this md a 
second  a portion of the dodd frank act sometimes referred to as the collins amendment directs the federal reserve to adopt new capital requirements for certain bank holding companies including suntrust banks  inc which are at least as stringent as those applicable to insured 
table of contents depositary institutions  such as suntrust bank 
we expect that the federal reserve will apply these to us over a year period beginning january  and that  as a result  approximately billion in principal amount of parent company trust preferred and other hybrid capital securities that will be outstanding at such future time  will no longer qualify for tier capital treatment at that time 
we will consider changes to our capital structure as these new regulations are published and become applicable to us 
in connection with the scap in  our regulators began focusing on tier common equity which is the portion of tier capital that is common equity 
tier common equity and the tier common equity ratio are not determined in accordance with us gaap and are not defined in federal banking regulations 
as a result  our calculation of these measures may be different than those of other financial service companies who calculate them 
however  tier common equity and the tier common equity ratio continue to be factors which regulators examine in evaluating financial institutions  therefore  we present these measures to allow for evaluations of our capital 
our capital levels increased with tier common equity  tier capital  and total capital ratios at   and  respectively  at december  compared to   and  respectively  at december  the increase in tier common equity and tier capital ratios was due to stable tier capital and tier common equity and the decline in risk weighted assets 
our total capital ratio was stable as a result of lower risk weighted assets  offset by the tender for subordinated debt that we completed in the third quarter 
see additional discussion related to the repurchase of debt securities in the liquidity risk section of this md a 
our capital position remains strong relative to current regulatory requirements 
our tier common ratio also exceeds the guidelines recently published by the bcbs and anticipated to be endorsed by the us regulatory agencies 
we declared and paid common dividends totaling million during the year ended december   or per common share  compared to million  or per common share  during in addition  we declared dividends payable during the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively  on our series a preferred stock 
further  during the years ended december  and  we declared dividends payable of million and million  respectively  to the us treasury on the series c and d preferred stock issued to the us treasury under the tarp s cpp 
given our capital position and our current liquidity  we believe are well positioned to repay tarp when regulatory approval is received 
however  the federal reserve has required similarly situated financial institutions to raise additional common equity as a prerequisite to repaying tarp  and there can be no assurance that we will not also be required to do so 
during  we reduced the common share dividend to per share  per quarter where it remained as of the most recent common share dividend declaration in february it is not likely that we will increase our dividend until we have obtained the consent of our applicable regulators as further described below 
the federal reserve is currently conducting a comprehensive review process the comprehensive capital plan review to evaluate the repayment of tarp by bank holding companies  as well as other capital related items such as common dividends and share repurchases  which will be completed by late march 
once the review process is completed  we will be in a better position to reevaluate our repayment options and the appropriate timing 
we expect that our current tier common ratio of  proforma basel iii tier common ratio of  and our reduced risk profile will serve us well in this process

we executed each of the rccs in favor of the holders of certain debt securities  who are initially the holders of our subordinated notes due the rccs are more fully described in current reports on form k filed on september   november   december   and march  in connection with the issuance of the series c and d preferred stock of suntrust  we agreed to certain terms affecting repurchase  redemption  and repayment of the preferred stock and restriction on payment of common stock dividends  among other terms 
included with the issuance of the series c and d preferred stock was issuance of ten year warrants to the us treasury to purchase approximately million and million shares of our common stock at initial exercise prices of and 
the preferred stock and related warrants were issued at a total discount of approximately million  which 
table of contents will be accreted into us treasury preferred dividend expense using the effective yield method over a five year period from each respective issuance date 
the terms of the warrants as well as the restrictions related to the issuance of the preferred stock is more fully described in current reports on form k filed on november  and january  we are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to increase the dividend as a result of participating in the us treasury s cpp 
generally  we may not pay a regular quarterly cash dividend of more than per share of common stock prior to november   unless either i we have redeemed the series c and series d preferred stock  ii the us treasury has transferred the series c and series d preferred stock to a third party  or iii the us treasury consents to the payment of such dividends in excess of such amount 
additionally  if we increase our quarterly dividend above per share prior to the tenth anniversary of our participation in the cpp  then the exercise price and the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants issued in connection with our participation in the cpp will be proportionately adjusted 
the amount of such adjustment will be determined by a formula and depends in part on the extent to which we raise our dividend 
the formulas are contained in the warrant agreements 
there also exists limits on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the parent company 
substantially all of our retained earnings are undistributed earnings of the bank  which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities

we have established an enterprise risk governance framework to manage these risks and to provide reasonable assurance that key business objectives will be achieved 
underlying this framework are limits  policies  processes and procedures designed to effectively identify  monitor and manage risk 
the board is wholly responsible for oversight of our corporate risk governance framework 
the risk committee of the board assists the board in executing this responsibility 
administration of the framework and governance process is the responsibility of the cro  who executes this responsibility through the crm organization 
the cro reports to the chief executive officer  and provides overall vision  direction and leadership regarding our enterprise risk management framework 
in addition  the cro provides regular risk assessments to executive management  the risk committee of the board  audit committee of the board and the full board  and provides other information to executive management and the board  as requested 

table of contents the enterprise risk governance framework incorporates a variety of senior management risk related committees 
these committees are responsible for ensuring effective risk measurement and management in their respective areas of authority 
these committees include crc  alco  and the eapmc 
the crc is chaired by the cro and supports the cro in measuring and managing our aggregate risk profile 
the crc consists of various senior executives and meets on a monthly basis 
the cro is an active member of the other oversight committees 
the cro and  by extension crm  establishes sound corporate risk processes that focus on identifying  measuring  monitoring  reporting and managing the risks which face the company 
at its core  crm s objective is to deliver sophisticated risk management capabilities throughout suntrust that identify  measure  analyze  manage and report risk at the transaction  portfolio and corporate levels  optimize decision making  promote sound processes and regulatory compliance  maximize shareholder value  and help people and institutions prosper 
to achieve this objective  we continually refine our risk governance and management limits  policies  processes and procedures to reflect changes in external conditions and or corporate goals and strategies 
similarly  risk management systems  processes and applications are routinely enhanced to support our risk and business objectives 
risk information is available at both an enterprise and a detailed level 
senior management and board reports provide a holistic picture of the organization s risk profile and trends  whereas detailed information provides insight at a more granular level to line managers 
we actively work to balance our strategic goals  including revenue and profitability objectives  with the risks associated with achieving these goals 
effective risk management is an important element supporting our business decision making 
organizationally  crm measures and manages risk along four dimensions credit risk  market risk including liquidity risk  operational risk and compliance legal risk  reputational risk  which can be influenced by any of the other risk disciplines  is also evaluated 
credit risk programs are overseen by the chief wholesale credit officer and the chief retail credit officer  market risk programs are overseen by the corporate market risk officer  operational risk programs are overseen by the coro  and compliance legal risk programs are overseen by the corporate compliance and regulatory liaison officer 
other activities overseen by crm include risk information and reporting  risk analytics  including stress testing and the alll  and other assurance and risk administration functions 
credit risk management credit risk refers to the potential for economic loss arising from the failure of clients to meet their contractual agreements on all credit instruments  including on balance sheet exposures from loans and leases  investment securities  contingent exposures from unfunded commitments  letters of credit  credit derivatives  and counterparty risk under derivative products 
as credit risk is an essential component of many of the products and services we provide to our clients  the ability to accurately measure and manage credit risk is integral to maintain both the long run profitability of our lines of business and our capital adequacy 
the credit risk management group manages and monitors extensions of credit risk through initial underwriting processes and periodic reviews which then maintain underwriting standards in accordance with credit policies and procedures 
the corporate risk review unit conducts independent risk reviews to ensure active compliance with all policies and procedures 
credit risk management periodically reviews our lines of business to monitor asset quality trends and the appropriateness of credit policies 
in addition  total borrower exposure limits are established and concentration risk is monitored 
credit risk is partially mitigated through purchase of credit loss protection via third party insurance and use of credit derivatives such as cds 
borrower counterparty obligor risk and facility risk are evaluated using our risk rating methodology  which has been implemented in all lines of business 
we use various risk models in the estimation of expected and unexpected losses 
these models incorporate both internal and external default and loss experience 
to the extent possible  we collect internal data to ensure the validity  reliability  and accuracy of our risk models used in default and loss estimation 

table of contents we have made a commitment to maintain and enhance comprehensive credit systems in order to meet business requirements and comply with evolving regulatory standards 
as part of a continuous improvement process  credit risk management evaluates potential enhancements to our risk measurement and management tools  implementing them as appropriate along with amended credit policies and procedures 
operational risk management we face ongoing and emerging risks and regulations related to the activities that surround the delivery of banking and financial products 
coupled with external influences such as market conditions  fraudulent activities  disasters  security risks  country risk  and legal risk  the potential for operational and reputational loss has increased significantly 
we believe that effective management of operational risk defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events plays a major role in both the level and the stability of the profitability of the institution 
our operational risk management function oversees an enterprise wide framework intended to identify  assess  control  quantify  monitor  and report on operational risks company wide 
these efforts support our goals in seeking to minimize operational losses and strengthen our performance by optimizing operational capital allocation 
operational risk management is overseen by our coro  who reports directly to the cro 
the operational risk governance structure also includes a risk manager and support staff embedded within each line of business and corporate function 
these risk managers also report indirectly to the coro and are responsible for execution of the operational risk management program within their areas 
market risk management market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  commodity prices  and other relevant market rates or prices 
interest rate risk  defined as the exposure of net interest income and mve to adverse movements in interest rates  is our primary market risk  and mainly arises from the structure of the balance sheet 
we are also exposed to market risk in our trading activities  investment portfolio  coke common stock  msrs  loan warehouse and pipeline  and debt and brokered deposits carried at fair value 
the alco meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our open positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk 
the policies established by alco are reviewed and approved by our board 
market risk from non trading activities the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk  both within policy limits approved by the board and within narrower guidelines established by alco 
these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short term and long term horizons 
the major sources of our non trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities  changes in the shape of the yield curve  and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options 
we measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models 
one of the primary methods that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis  which is used to model net interest income from assets  liabilities  and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures 
this analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income over a two year time horizon 
key assumptions in the simulation analysis and in the valuation analysis discussed below relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads  the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments 
this analysis incorporates several assumptions  the most material of which relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate or non contractual maturities 
as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance  we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including implied forward and deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios 
the analyses may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates  rate shocks  basis risk analysis  and yield curve twists 
each 
table of contents analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about client behavior in an interest rate scenario 
specific strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on net interest income levels and sensitivities 
the sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in net interest income due to an instantaneous basis point move in benchmark interest rates 
estimated changes set forth below are dependent upon material assumptions such as those previously discussed 
the net interest income profile reflects a relatively neutral interest rate sensitive position with respect to an instantaneous basis point change in rates 
economic perspective rate change basis points estimated change in net interest income over months december  december  the recognition of interest rate sensitivity from an economic perspective above is different from a financial reporting perspective below due to certain interest rate swaps that are used as economic hedges for fixed rate debt 
the above profile includes the recognition of the net interest payments from these swaps  while the profile below does not include the net interest payments 
the swaps are accounted for as trading assets and therefore  the benefit to income due to a decline in short term interest rates will be recognized as a gain in the fair value of the swaps and will be recorded as an increase in trading account profits losses and commissions from a financial reporting perspective 
financial reporting perspective rate change basis points estimated change in net interest income over months december  december  the difference from december  to december  seen above in both the economic and financial reporting perspectives related to a basis point shock is primarily due to interest rates being at or near terminally low levels as well as reaching floors of essentially zero percent in downward rate shocks 
we also perform valuation analysis  which is used for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the net interest income simulation analysis above 
whereas net interest income simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon  valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions 
the valuation of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows and derivative cash flows minus the discounted present value of liability cash flows  the net of which is referred to as mve 
the sensitivity of mve to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet 
similar to the net interest income simulation  mve uses instantaneous changes in rates 
mve values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the net interest income simulation model 
as with the net interest income simulation model  assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the mve analysis 
particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios 
as of december   the mve profile indicates modest changes with respect to an instantaneous basis point change in rates 
rate shock basis points estimated change in mve december  december  
table of contents while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario  we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact 
since mve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments  the change in mve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon ie  the current fiscal year 
further  mve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth  changes in product mix  changes in yield curve relationships  and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates 
the net interest income simulation and valuation analyses do not include actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates 
trading activities trading instruments are used as part of our overall balance sheet management strategies and to support client requirements through our broker dealer subsidiary 
product offerings to clients include debt securities  loans traded in the secondary market  equity securities  derivatives and foreign exchange contracts  and similar financial instruments 
other trading activities include acting as a market maker in certain debt and equity securities and related derivatives 
typically  we maintain a securities inventory to facilitate client transactions 
also in the normal course of business  we assume a limited degree of market risk in hedging strategies 
under established policies and procedures we manage market risk associated with trading  capital markets and foreign exchange activities using a var approach that determines total exposure arising from interest rate risk  equity risk  foreign exchange risk  spread risk  and volatility risk 
for trading portfolios  var measures the estimated maximum loss from a trading position  given a specified confidence level and time horizon 
var exposures and actual results are monitored daily for each trading portfolio 
our var calculation measures the potential losses using a confidence level with a one day holding period 
this means that  on average  losses are expected to exceed var two or three times per year 
we had no backtest exceptions to our overall var during the last twelve months 
the following table displays high  low  and average var for the years ended december  and dollars in millions average var high var low var average var during the year ended december  was lower compared to the year ended december  primarily due to sales  paydowns and maturities of illiquid trading assets 
this is a result of continuing to manage down illiquid asset holdings where possible  as they are not part of our core business activities 
trading assets net of trading liabilities averaged billion and billion for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline in average trading balances is primarily a result of balance sheet management activities 
trading assets net of trading liabilities were billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the increase in trading assets net of trading liabilities was primarily due to increases in the trs portfolio at year end 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet obligations as they come due at a reasonable funding cost 
we mitigate this risk by structuring our balance sheet prudently and by maintaining diverse borrowing resources to fund potential cash needs 
for example  we structure our balance sheet so that we fund less liquid assets  such as loans  with stable funding sources  such as retail and wholesale deposits  long term debt and capital 
we assess liquidity needs in both the normal course of business and times of unusual events  considering both on and off balance sheet arrangements and commitments that may impact liquidity in certain business environments 
we have contingency funding plans that assess liquidity needs that may arise from certain stress events such as credit rating downgrades  rapid asset growth  and financial market disruptions 
our contingency plans also provide for continuous monitoring of net borrowed funds dependence and available sources of contingent liquidity 
these sources of contingent liquidity include available cash reserves  capacity to borrow from the fhlb system  the ability to sell  pledge  or borrow against unencumbered securities in the bank s investment portfolio and the capacity to borrow at the federal reserve discount window 
as of december   the potential liquidity from these four sources totaled billion  which we believe exceeds any contingent liquidity needs 

table of contents our alco measures liquidity risks  sets policies to manage these risks  and reviews adherence to those policies at its monthly meetings 
for example  we manage the use of short term unsecured borrowings as well as total wholesale funding through policies established and reviewed by alco 
in addition  the risk committee of our board sets liquidity limits and reviews current and forecasted liquidity positions at each of its regularly scheduled meetings 
uses of funds 
our primary uses of funds include the extension of loans and credit  the purchase of investment securities  working capital  and debt and capital service 
in addition  contingent uses of funds may arise from events such as financial market disruptions or credit rating downgrades 
factors that affect our credit ratings include  but are not limited to  the credit risk profile of our assets  the adequacy of our alll  earnings  the liquidity profile of both the bank and the parent company  the economic environment  and the adequacy of our capital base 
during  suntrust received one notch credit ratings downgrades from each of the four primary nrsros moody s  standard poor s  fitch and dbrs 
the incremental impact of these downgrades to our daily business operations was immaterial given that our credit ratings remained investment grade  many peer banks received similar downgrades  our capital ratios remained well above regulatory standards for being well capitalized  and most of our fundamental credit metrics improved during the course of the year 
as of december   all of the primary nrsros maintained a stable outlook on our credit ratings 
given the stable outlooks  additional downgrades are possible although not anticipated  see part i  item a  risk factors  for additional information 
the bank and the parent company borrow in the money markets using instruments such as fed funds  eurodollars  and cp 
as of december   the parent company had no cp outstanding and the bank retained a material cash position in the form of excess reserves in its federal reserve account 
in the absence of robust loan demand  we have chosen to deploy some of this excess liquidity to purchase and retire certain high cost debt securities or other borrowings 
during  we repurchased billion of bank and parent company debt securities  including senior and subordinated notes  senior notes guaranteed under the fdic s dgp  and fhlb advances 
as of december   the bank had just million of outstanding fhlb advances 
sources of funds 
our primary source of funds is a large  stable retail deposit base 
core deposits  primarily gathered from our retail branch network  are our largest and most cost effective source of funding 
core deposits totaled billion as of december   up from billion as of december  the bank used core deposit growth to replace some of the billion of term wholesale funding  which matured during the year ended december   bolstering the quality and depth of the bank s already strong liquidity position 
we also maintain access to a diversified collection of wholesale funding sources 
these uncommitted sources include fed funds purchased from other banks  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  negotiable cds  offshore deposits  fhlb advances  global bank notes  and cp 
aggregate wholesale funding totaled billion as of december   down from billion as of december  net short term unsecured borrowings  which includes wholesale domestic and foreign deposits and fed funds purchased  totaled billion as of december   down from billion as of december  we also have access to wholesale liquidity via the capital markets 
the parent company maintains an sec shelf registration statement from which it may issue senior or subordinated notes and various capital securities such as common or preferred stock 
our board has authorized the issuance of up to billion of such securities 
the bank maintains a global bank note program under which it may issue senior or subordinated debt with various terms 
as of december   the bank had capacity to issue billion of notes under the global bank note program 
borrowings under these programs are designed to appeal primarily to domestic and international institutional investors 
institutional investor demand for these securities is dependent upon numerous factors  including but not limited to our credit ratings and investor perception of financial market conditions and the health of the banking sector 
our capacity under these programs refers to authorization granted by our board  and does not refer to a commitment to purchase by any investor 
parent company liquidity 
our primary measure of parent company liquidity is the length of time the parent company can meet its existing obligations using its present cash balance without the support of dividends from the bank or new debt issuance 
in accordance with risk limits established by alco and the board  we manage the parent company s liquidity by structuring its maturity schedule to minimize the amount of debt maturing within a short period of time 
approximately million of parent company debt matured during the year ended december  and none is scheduled to mature during much of the parent company s liabilities are long term in nature  coming from the proceeds of our capital securities and long term senior and subordinated notes 

table of contents the primary uses of parent company liquidity include debt service  dividends on capital instruments  the periodic purchase of investment securities  and loans to our subsidiaries 
we fund corporate dividends primarily with dividends from our banking subsidiary 
we are subject to both state and federal banking regulations that limit our ability to pay common stock dividends in certain circumstances 
in september amidst the economic recession and credit market turmoil  we reduced our quarterly common stock dividend to its current level of per share 
an increase in our quarterly dividend will be dependent upon  among other factors  a sustained return to profitability and the consent of our applicable bank regulators 
recent developments 
additional regulatory standards for bank liquidity were proposed during in december of  the bcbs reached final agreement on these proposals to strengthen and standardize global liquidity standards 
the proposed standards would require banks to comply with two new liquidity ratios the lcr and the nsfr 
the lcr is the ratio of a bank s stock of high quality liquid assets to estimated net cash outflows during an acute day stress scenario 
the nsfr measures the amount of a bank s long term stable funding relative to the liquidity profile of its funded assets and the potential for contingent liquidity needs arising from off balance sheet commitments 
the intent of the lcr and nsfr is to promote the retention of significant liquidity reserves and the increased use of stable funding sources such as core deposits and long term debt 
our regulators have not yet adopted these new standards  although we expect the federal reserve will issue a notice of proposed rulemaking later in that will define how us banks will be required to implement them 
the bcbs s recommended adoption dates for these new standards are january  for the lcr and january  for the nsfr 
in the meantime  we continue to refine our methodologies for calculating these new liquidity ratios and develop plans for compliance with the new standards 
we believe the goals of these standards are consistent with our existing liquidity management framework  policies and practices 
it is possible that these liquidity requirements will continue to evolve in the coming months  making it difficult to quantify precisely the costs and other business impacts of these proposed measures at this time 
in general  however  these standards may lead to changes in the cost and maturity profile of our funding and or the size and composition of our investment portfolio 
we believe the company will be well positioned to comply with the new standards given our strong core banking franchise and conservative liquidity management practices 
other liquidity considerations 
as detailed in table  we had an aggregate potential obligation of billion to our clients in unused lines of credit at december  commitments to extend credit are arrangements to lend to clients who have complied with predetermined contractual obligations 
as of december   the bank had unused lines of credit issued in support of three pillars as shown in the cp conduit line in table as of january  we consolidated three pillars 
therefore  as of december   the amount of the cp conduit line depicted in table represents the unused lines of credit that three pillars has extended to its clients  as opposed to the lines of credit that the bank has extended to three pillars  which are still legally outstanding 
for more information about three pillars  see note  certain transfers of financial assets  mortgage servicing rights and variable interest entities  to the consolidated financial statements 
we also had billion in letters of credit as of december   most of which are standby letters of credit  which require that we provide funding if certain future events occur 
approximately billion of these letters as of december  supported vrdos 
our lines and letters of credit have declined since december  due to our decision to reduce exposure to certain higher risk areas  as well as our clients decision not to renew their lines and letters of credit as a result of their decreased need for these facilities as they pay down their debt and reduce their need for working capital 
certain provisions of long term debt agreements and the lines of credit prevent us from creating liens on  disposing of  or issuing except to related parties voting stock of subsidiaries 
further  there are restrictions on mergers  consolidations  certain leases  sales or transfers of assets  and minimum shareholders equity ratios 
as of december   we were and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants and provisions of these debt agreements 
as of december   our cumulative utbs amounted to million 
interest related to utbs was million as of december  these utbs represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns and the benefits recognized and measured in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for income taxes 
the utbs are based on various tax positions in several jurisdictions and  if taxes related to these positions are ultimately paid  the payments would be made from our normal  operating cash flows  likely over multiple years 

table of contents other market risk other sources of market risk include the risk associated with holding residential and commercial mortgage loans prior to selling them into the secondary market  commitments to clients to make mortgage loans that will be sold to the secondary market  and our investment in msrs 
we manage the risks associated with the residential and commercial mortgage loans classified as held for sale ie  the warehouse and our irlcs on residential loans intended for sale 
the warehouses and irlcs consist primarily of fixed and adjustable rate single family residential and commercial real estate 
the risk associated with the warehouses and irlcs is the potential change in interest rates between the time the customer locks in the rate on the anticipated loan and the time the loan is sold on the secondary market  which is typically days 
we manage interest rate risk predominantly with interest rate swaps  futures  and forward sale agreements  where the changes in value of the instruments substantially offset the changes in value of the warehouse and the irlcs 
the irlcs on residential mortgage loans intended for sale are classified as free standing derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedge accounting relationships 
msrs are the present value of future net cash flows that are expected to be received from the mortgage servicing portfolio 
the value of msrs is highly dependent upon the assumed prepayment speed of the mortgage servicing portfolio which is driven by the level of certain key interest rates  primarily the year current coupon par mortgage rate known as the par mortgage rate 
future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan in the mortgage servicing portfolio would not be realized if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated 
prepayment speeds have generally been slowing down given the current economic environment  however  the level of prepayments began to pick up towards the second half of  but the impact from increasing prepayments was offset by additions to the msr portfolio from new origination activity 
we historically have not actively hedged msrs  but have managed the market risk through our overall asset liability management process with consideration to the natural counter cyclicality of servicing and production that occurs as interest rates rise and fall over time with the economic cycle as well as with securities afs 
however  as of january   we designated the msrs vintage and all future msrs production at fair value 
in addition  as of january   we designated at fair value the remaining msr portfolio of million being carried at locom 
upon designating the remaining msrs at fair value  we increased the carrying value of these msrs by million and recorded an increase in retained earnings  net of taxes  of million 
the decision to designate the msr portfolio at fair value  key economic assumptions  and the sensitivity of the current fair value of the msrs as of december  and is discussed in greater detail in note  goodwill and other intangible assets and note  certain transfers of financial assets  mortgage servicing rights and variable interest entities  to the consolidated financial statements 
the msrs being carried at fair value total billion and million as of december  and  respectively  and are managed within established risk limits and are monitored as part of various governance processes 
we originated msrs with a fair value of million and million  at the time of origination  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we recorded a decrease in fair value of million for the year ended december   and an increase in fair value of million for the year ended december   including decay resulting from the realization of expected monthly net servicing cash flows 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded a loss in the consolidated statements of income loss related to fair value msrs of million including decay of million and million including decay of million  respectively  inclusive of the mark to market adjustments on the related hedges 
we also recorded an impairment recovery in the consolidated statements of income loss of million during the year ended december   related to msrs carried at locom at the time 
we also have market risk from capital stock we hold in the fhlb of atlanta and from capital stock we hold in the federal reserve bank 
in order to be an fhlb member  we are required to purchase capital stock in the fhlb 
in exchange  members take advantage of competitively priced advances as a wholesale funding source and access grants and low cost loans for affordable housing and community development projects  amongst other benefits 
as of december   we held a total of million of capital stock in the fhlb 
during  we reduced our capital stock holdings in the fhlb by million 
in order to become a member of the federal reserve system  regulations require that we hold a certain amount of capital stock as a percentage of the bank s capital

the utbs are based on various tax positions in several jurisdictions and  if taxes related to these positions are ultimately paid  the payments would be made from our normal  operating cash flows  likely over multiple years 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in detail in note  significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements and are integral to understanding our financial performance 
we have identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require judgment about matters that are highly uncertain and different estimates that could be reasonably applied would result in materially different assessments with respect to ascertaining the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments  and contingencies 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset  valuing an asset or liability  or reducing a liability 
our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with us gaap  and they conform to general practices within the financial services industry 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a description of our current critical accounting policies 
contingencies we face uncertainty with respect to the ultimate outcomes of various contingencies including the allowance for credit losses  mortgage repurchase reserves  and legal and regulatory matters 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is composed of the alll and the reserve for unfunded commitments 
the alll represents our estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the alll is increased by the provision for credit losses and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the alll is determined based on our review and evaluation of larger loans that meet our definition of impairment and the current risk characteristics of pools of homogeneous loans ie  loans having similar characteristics within the loan portfolio and our assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data 
large commercial nonaccrual loans and certain commercial  consumer  and residential loans whose terms have been modified in a tdr  are individually evaluated to determine the amount of specific allowance required using the most probable source of repayment  including the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows  the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs of disposition  or the loan s estimated market value 
in these measurements  we use assumptions and methodologies that are relevant to estimating the level of impaired and unrealized losses in the portfolio 
to the extent that the data supporting such assumptions has limitations  our judgment and experience play a key role in enhancing the specific alll estimates 
key judgments used in determining the alll include internal risk ratings  market and collateral values  discount rates  loss rates  and our view of current economic conditions 
general allowances are established for loans and leases grouped into pools that have similar characteristics  including smaller balance homogeneous loans 
the alll committee estimates probable losses by evaluating quantitative and qualitative factors for each loan portfolio segment  including net charge off trends  internal risk ratings  changes in internal risk ratings  loss forecasts  collateral values  geographic location  delinquency rates  nonperforming and restructured loans  origination channel  product mix  underwriting practices  industry conditions  and economic trends 
in addition to these factors  the consumer and residential portfolio segments consider borrower fico scores and the commercial portfolio segment considers single name borrower concentration 
estimated collateral valuations are based on appraisals  broker price opinions  recent sales of foreclosed properties  automated valuation models  other property specific information  and relevant market information  supplemented by our internal property valuation professionals 
the value estimate is based on an orderly disposition and marketing period of the property 
in limited instances  we adjust externally provided appraisals for justifiable and well supported reasons  such as an appraiser not being aware of certain property specific factors or recent sales information 
appraisals generally represent the as is value of the property but may be adjusted based on the intended disposition strategy of the property 

table of contents our determination of the alll for commercial loans is sensitive to the assigned internal risk ratings and inherent loss rates at december  in the event that percent of loans within this portfolio segment experienced downgrades of two internal risk ratings  the alll for the commercial portfolio would increase by approximately million at december  in the event that estimated loss severity rates for the entire commercial loan portfolio increased by percent  the alll for the commercial portfolio would increase by approximately million at december  our determination of the allowance for residential and consumer loans is also sensitive to changes in estimated loss severity rates 
in the event that estimated loss severity rates for the residential and consumer loan portfolio increased by percent  the alll for the residential and consumer portfolios would increase  in total  by approximately million at december  because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the alll  these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the alll 
they are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in risk rating and estimated loss severity rates and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss rates 
given current processes employed  management believes the risk ratings and inherent loss rates currently assigned are appropriate 
it is possible that others  given the same information  may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions that could be significant to our financial statements 
in addition to the alll  we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments  such as letters of credit and binding unfunded loan commitments 
unfunded lending commitments are analyzed and segregated by risk similar to funded loans based on our internal risk rating scale 
these risk classifications  in combination with an analysis of historical loss experience  probability of commitment usage  and any other pertinent information  result in the estimation of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 
our financial results are affected by the changes in and the absolute level of the allowance for credit losses 
this process involves our analysis of complex internal and external variables  and it requires that we exercise judgment to estimate an appropriate allowance for credit losses 
as a result of the uncertainty associated with this subjectivity  we cannot assure the precision of the amount reserved should we experience sizeable loan or lease losses in any particular period 
for example  changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions  or the condition of various markets in which collateral may be sold could require us to significantly decrease or increase the level of the allowance for credit losses 
such an adjustment could materially affect net income as a result of the change in provision for credit losses 
during and  we experienced elevated delinquencies and net charge offs in residential real estate loans due to the deterioration of the housing market 
these market conditions were considered in deriving the estimated allowance for credit losses  however  given the continued economic challenges and uncertainties  the ultimate amount of loss could vary from that estimate 
for additional discussion of the alll see the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets sections in this md a as well as note  loans  and note  allowance for credit losses  to the consolidated financial statements 
mortgage repurchase reserve we sell residential mortgage loans to investors through securitizations or whole loan sales in the normal course of our business 
in association with these transactions  we provide representations and warranties to the buyers that these loans meet certain requirements 
in the last few years  we have seen a significant increase in buyer claims regarding material breaches of these representations and warranties resulting in a significant increase in the repurchase liability 
the increase in repurchase losses has primarily related to loans sold from to we have received fewer repurchase requests related to loans sold prior to and after due to the stronger credit performance of these loans and improvements in credit guidelines and underwriting process implemented progressively  beginning in the increase in repurchase requests has been driven by loans sold to the gses  with a limited number of requests having been received related to non agency investors 
we maintain a liability for losses resulting from loan repurchases and indemnifications that is initially based upon the fair value of these guarantees 
subsequently  the liability is reduced in proportion to the reduction in risk as actual losses are incurred  and additions to the liability are made for our estimate of incurred losses 
the liability is calculated by sales vintage based on various factors including existing repurchase demands  the population of loans that have ever been or more days past due  including loans currently delinquent that are expected to migrate to days past due  the probability that a repurchase request related to a defaulted loan will be received  
table of contents the probability that a loan demanded for repurchase will be repurchased  and historical loss experience 
some of the assumptions used in this process contain a level of uncertainty since these assumptions are largely derived from historical experience that is limited and highly variable 
as such  provision expense will vary as the estimates used to measure the liability continue to be updated based on the level of repurchase requests  the latest experience gained on repurchase requests and other relevant facts and circumstances 
one of the most critical and judgmental assumptions is the repurchase request rate because it requires us to make assessments regarding the actions that will be taken by third party purchasers in the context of the limited and highly variable history we have experienced with their current volume of requests 
once we estimate the level of requests that we expect to receive by vintage  we apply factors for the probability that a loan will be repurchased as well as the loss severity expected 
based on our experience during  we estimate that our actual repurchase rate relative to our demands will be approximately 
with regard to losses experienced on loan repurchases  including make whole settlements  our current experience has averaged approximately of our demands 
the experience varies by vintage and will be affected by future housing price changes 
we expect future repurchase related losses and reserves will be largely driven by the volume of repurchase requests received from the gses  which have exhibited considerable monthly volatility 
to date  the majority of our repurchase requests have been associated with and vintages  which produce higher losses 
however  we expect that normal seasoning patterns for origination vintages  over time  will shift new repurchase requests to newer production vintages which have a lower risk profile 
as that occurs  we expect lower aggregate request volumes and lower loss frequencies and severities  as the newer vintages exhibit more favorable characteristics  such as higher ficos and lower original ltvs  as they were originated during or after periods that experienced the most significant home price depreciation 
assuming a simultaneous adverse change in all three of our key assumptions  our reserve estimate would increase by approximately million 
this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical in nature and intended to provide perspective on the potential impact that changes in key assumptions would have upon our estimate 
it is highly unlikely that future developments would lead us to change key assumptions by the same relative percentage because they are likely to move independently to some degree 
various factors could potentially impact the accuracy of the assumptions underlying our mortgage repurchase reserve estimate 
as previously discussed  the level of repurchase and indemnification requests we receive is dependent upon the actions of third parties and could differ significantly from the assumptions that we have made 
delinquency levels  delinquency roll rates  and our loss severity assumptions are all highly dependent upon economic factors including changes in real estate values and unemployment levels which are  by nature  difficult to predict 
loss severity assumptions could also be negatively impacted by delays in the foreclosure process which is a heightened risk in some of the states where our loans sold were originated 
approximately of the population of loans sold between january  and december  were sold to non agency investors  some in the form of securitizations 
due to the nature of these structures and the indirect ownership interests  the potential exists that investors  over time  will become more successful in forcing additional repurchase demands 
while we have used the best information available in estimating the mortgage repurchase reserve liability  these and other factors  along with the discovery of additional information in the future could result in changes in our assumptions which could materially impact our results of operations 
legal and regulatory matters we are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits arising in the course of our normal business activities  some of which involve claims for substantial amounts  and the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss  if any  in preparing our financial statements 
we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party 
we record a liability for such claims when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
our estimates are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings  the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel 
in many such proceedings  it is not possible to determine whether a liability has 
table of contents been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate  our estimates may be materially different than the actual outcomes  which could have material effects on our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
however  it is the opinion of management that liabilities arising from these claims in excess of the amounts currently accrued  if any  will not have a material adverse impact to the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
see note  contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
estimates of fair value fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
certain of our assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
examples of recurring uses of fair value include derivative instruments  afs and trading securities  certain lhfi and lhfs  certain issuances of long term debt  and msrs 
we also measure certain assets at fair value on a non recurring basis either when such assets are carried at the locom  to evaluate assets for impairment  or for disclosure purposes 
examples of these non recurring uses of fair value include certain lhfs  oreo  goodwill  intangible assets  nonmarketable equity securities  and long lived assets 
depending on the nature of the asset or liability  we use various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating fair value 
the objective of fair value is to use market based inputs or assumptions  when available  to estimate the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
where observable market prices from transactions for identical assets or liabilities are not available  we identify what we believe to be similar assets or liabilities 
if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain for any such similar assets or liabilities  we look to other techniques such as obtaining third party quotes or using modeling techniques  such as discounted cash flows  while attempting to utilize market observable assumptions to the extent available 
absent current market activity in that specific security or a similar security  the resulting valuation approach will require making a number of significant judgments in the estimation of fair value 
market conditions during the credit crisis led to limited or nonexistent trading in certain of the financial asset classes that we have owned 
the lack of liquidity and low level of activity in these markets creates additional challenges when estimating the fair value of related financial instruments 
generally  the assets and liabilities most affected by the lack of liquidity are those required to be classified as level in the fair value hierarchy 
as a result  various processes and controls have been adopted to determine that appropriate methodologies  techniques and assumptions are used in the development of fair value estimates  particularly related to those instruments that require the use of significant  unobservable inputs 
we continue to maintain a cross functional approach when estimating the fair value of these difficult to value financial instruments 
this includes input from not only the related line of business  but also from risk management and finance  to ultimately arrive at a consensus estimate of the instrument s fair value after evaluating all available information pertaining to fair value 
this process has involved the gathering of multiple sources of information  including broker quotes  values provided by pricing services  trading activity in other similar securities  market indices  pricing matrices along with employing various modeling techniques  such as discounted cash flow analyses  in arriving at the best estimate of fair value 
modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability  including market based assumptions  such as interest rates  as well as assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique  the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset  market liquidity  and the risk of nonperformance 
in certain cases  our assessments with respect to assumptions that market participants would make may be inherently difficult to determine and the use of different assumptions could result in material changes to these fair value measurements 
we used significant unobservable inputs to fair value  on a recurring basis  certain trading assets  securities afs  portfolio loans accounted for at fair value  irlcs  lhfs  msrs and certain derivatives 
the following table discloses assets and liabilities that have been impacted by level fair value determinations 

table of contents table level assets and liabilities as of december  dollars in millions trading assets securities afs lhfs lhfi other intangible assets other assets total level assets total assets total assets measured at fair value level assets as a percent of total assets level assets as a percent of total assets measured at fair value long term debt trading liabilities other liabilities  total level liabilities total liabilities total liabilities measured at fair value level liabilities as a percent of total liabilities level liabilities as a percent of total liabilities measured at fair value msrs carried at fair value 
includes irlcs 
includes derivative related to sale of visa shares during the second quarter of overall  the financial impact of the level financial instruments did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital 
some fair value assets are pledged for corporate borrowings or other liquidity purposes 
most of these arrangements provide for advances to be made based on the market value and not the principal balance of the assets  and therefore whether or not we have elected fair value accounting treatment does not impact our liquidity 
if the fair value of assets posted as collateral declines  we will be required to post more collateral under our borrowing arrangements which could negatively impact our liquidity position on an overall basis 
for purposes of computing regulatory capital  mark to market adjustments related to our own creditworthiness for debt and index linked cds accounted for at fair value are excluded from regulatory capital 
the following discussion provides further information on fair value accounting by balance sheet category including the difficult to value assets and liabilities displayed in the table above 
trading assets and liabilities and securities afs in estimating the fair values for the majority of securities afs and trading instruments  including residual and certain other retained securitization interests  fair values are based on observable market prices of the same or similar instruments 
we also gather third party broker quotes or use industry standard or proprietary models to estimate the fair value of these instruments 
for certain securities and trading instruments  the distressed market conditions associated with this economic recession over the past few years have impacted our ability to obtain market pricing data on certain portfolios of securities 
even when market pricing has been available  the reduced trading activity resulting from current market conditions has challenged the observability of these quotations 
however  we have seen certain markets begin to recover and have also been able to liquidate many of our level assets through sales  maturities  or other distributions at prices approximating our previous estimates 
when fair values are estimated based on internal models  we will consider relevant market indices that correlate to the underlying collateral  along with assumptions such as liquidity discounts  interest rates  prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severity rates  and discount rates 
pricing services and broker quotes were obtained  when available  to assist in estimating the fair value of level instruments 
we evaluate third party pricing to determine the reasonableness of the information relative to changes in market data such as any recent trades we executed  market information received from outside market participants and analysts  and or changes in the underlying collateral performance 
the number of quotes we obtained varied based on the number of brokers following a particular security  but we generally attempt to obtain two to four quotes to determine reasonableness and comparability on a relative basis 
in most cases  the current market conditions caused the broker quotes to be indicative and the price indications and broker quotes to be supported by very limited to no recent market activity 
in those instances  we weighted the third party information according to our judgment of it being a reasonable indication of the instrument s fair value 

table of contents when actual trades are not available to corroborate pricing information received  we will use industry standard or proprietary models to estimate fair value  and will consider assumptions such as relevant market indices that correlate to the underlying collateral  prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severity rates  and discount rates 
while it is difficult to accurately predict the ultimate cash value of these securities  we believe the amount that would be ultimately realized if the securities were held to settlement or maturity will generally be greater than the current fair value of the securities classified as level this assessment is based on the current performance of the underlying collateral  which is experiencing elevated losses but generally not to the degree that correlates to current market values  which is pressured downward due to liquidity issues and other broad macroeconomic conditions 
it is reasonably likely that market volatility for certain instruments will continue as a result of a variety of external factors 
this lack of liquidity has caused us to evaluate the performance of the underlying collateral and use a discount rate commensurate with the rate a market participant would use to value the instrument in an orderly transaction  but that also acknowledges illiquidity premiums and required investor rates of return that would be demanded under current market conditions 
the discount rate considered the capital structure of the instrument  market indices  and the relative yields of instruments for which third party pricing information and or market activity was available 
in certain instances  the interest rate and credit risk components of the valuation indicated a full return of expected principal and interest  however  the lack of liquidity resulted in wide ranges of discounts in valuing certain level instruments 
the illiquidity that continues to persist in certain markets are requiring discounts of this degree to drive a market competitive yield  as well as account for the anticipated extended tenor 
the discount rates selected derived reasonable prices when compared to i observable transactions  when available  ii other securities on a relative basis  iii the bid ask spread of non binding broker indicative bids and or iv our professional judgment 
all of the techniques used and information obtained in the valuation process provides a range of estimated values  which were evaluated and compared in order to establish an estimated value that  based on management s judgment  represented a reasonable estimate of the instrument s fair value 
it was not uncommon for the range of value of these instruments to vary widely  in such cases  we selected an estimated value that we believed was the best indication of value based on the yield a market participant in this current environment would expect 
due to the continued illiquidity and credit risk of level securities  these market values are highly sensitive to assumption changes and market volatility 
improvements may be made to our pricing methodologies on an ongoing basis as observable and relevant information becomes available to us 
see note  fair value election and measurement  to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion regarding level and securities and valuation methodologies for each class of securities 
most derivative instruments are level or level instruments  except for the irlcs  the visa litigation related derivative  discussed below  and the agreements we entered into related to our investment in coke common stock  which are level instruments 
because the value of the agreements is primarily driven by the embedded equity collars on the coke common shares  a black scholes model is the appropriate valuation model 
most of the assumptions are directly observable from the market  such as the per share market price of coke common stock  interest rates  and the dividend rate on coke common stock 
volatility is a significant assumption and is impacted both by the unusually large size of the trade and the long tenor until settlement 
the agreements carry scheduled terms of approximately six and a half and seven years from the effective date  and as such  the observable and active options market on coke does not provide for any identical or similar instruments 
as a result  we receive estimated market values from a market participant who is knowledgeable about coke equity derivatives and is active in the market 
based on inquiries of the market participant as to their procedures as well as our own valuation assessment procedures  we have satisfied ourselves that the market participant is using methodologies and assumptions that other market participants would use in arriving at the fair value of the agreements 
at december   the coke derivative liability was valued at million and was included within the level trading liabilities portfolio 
at december   level trading assets and level securities afs totaled million and billion  respectively 
our level securities afs portfolio included fhlb and federal reserve bank stock  as well as certain municipal bond securities  some of which are only redeemable with the issuer at par and cannot be traded in the market  as such  no significant observable market data for these instruments is available 
these nonmarketable securities afs totaled approximately million at december  the remaining level securities  both trading assets and securities afs  are predominantly private abs and mbs and cdos  including interests retained from company sponsored securitizations or purchased from third party securitizations 
we also have exposure to bank trust preferred abs  student loan abs  and municipal securities due to our purchase of certain ars as a result of failed auctions 
for all level securities  little or no market activity exists for either the security or the underlying collateral and therefore the significant assumptions used to value the securities are not market observable 

table of contents level trading assets declined by million  or  during the year ended december   primarily due to sales  paydowns  redemptions  and maturities of securities  partially offset by net unrealized mark to market gains and a small amount of purchases 
level securities afs declined by million  or  during the year ended december   due to continued paydowns and redemptions by issuers of securities  partially offset by net unrealized mark to market gains and a small amount of ars purchases 
both level securities afs and trading assets were also reduced by a transfer of senior level student loan ars and a clo preference share position out of level into level totaling million of securities afs and million of trading assets during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recognized through earnings million in net gains related to trading assets and liabilities and securities afs classified as level loans the fair values of lhfi and lhfs are based on observable current market prices in the secondary loan market in which loans trade  as either whole loans or as abs 
when securities prices are obtained in the secondary loan market  we will translate these prices into whole loan prices by incorporating adjustments for estimated credit enhancement costs  loan servicing fees  and various other transformation costs  when material 
the fair value of a loan is impacted by the nature of the asset and the market liquidity 
when estimating fair value for loans that do not trade in an active market  we will make assumptions about prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severity rates  and liquidity discounts 
absent comparable current market data  we believe that the fair value derived from these various approaches is a reasonable approximation of the prices that we would receive upon sale of the loans 
level loans are primarily non agency residential mortgage loans for which there are little to no observable trades in either the new issuance or secondary loan markets as either whole loans or as securities 
prior to the disruption in the non agency residential loan market  we were able to obtain certain observable pricing from either the new issuance or secondary loan market 
however  as the markets deteriorated and certain loans were not actively trading as either whole loans or as securities  we began employing the same alternative valuation methodologies used to value level residential mbs to fair value the mortgage loans 
transfers of certain mortgage lhfs into level during were largely due to borrower defaults or the identification of other loan defects impacting the marketability of the loans 
during the year ended december   we transferred million of npls that were previously designated as lhfi to lhfs  we subsequently sold the transferred npls at prices that approximated fair value 
these loans were predominantly reported at amortized cost prior to their transfer to lhfs 
during the year ended december   we transferred million of loans that were previously designated as lhfs to lhfi  as they were determined to be no longer marketable 
of this amount  million were loans for which fair value accounting had been elected  these loans will continue to be reported at fair value within lhfi 
other intangible assets and other assets beginning january   we began recording all msrs at fair value on a recurring basis 
the fair value of msrs is based on discounted cash flow analyses and can be highly variable quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change 
we provide disclosure of the key economic assumptions used to measure msrs and residual interests and a sensitivity analysis to adverse changes to these assumptions in note  certain transfers of financial assets  mortgage servicing rights and variable interest entities  to the consolidated financial statements 
this sensitivity analysis does not take into account hedging activities discussed in the other market risk section of this md a 
the fair values of oreo and other repossessed assets are typically determined based on recent appraisals by third parties and other market information 
our oreo properties are concentrated in georgia  florida  and north carolina  therefore further deterioration in property values in those states or changes to our disposition strategies could cause our estimates of oreo values to decline which would result in further write downs 
estimates of fair value are also required when performing an impairment analysis of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets 
for long lived assets  including intangible assets subject to amortization  an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
in determining the fair value  management uses models which require assumptions about growth rates  the life of the asset  and or the market value of the assets 
we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our carrying amount may not be recoverable 

table of contents other liabilities during the second quarter of  in connection with our sale of visa class b shares  we entered into a derivative contract whereby the ultimate cash payments received or paid  if any  under the contract are based on the ultimate resolution of litigation involving visa 
the value of the derivative is estimated based on our expectations regarding the ultimate resolution of that litigation  which involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity 
as a result  the value of the derivative liability was classified as a level instrument 
at december   the visa derivative liability was valued at million and was included within other liabilities 
see note  reinsurance arrangements and guarantees  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the fair value methodology and assumptions related to our irlcs is described in note  fair value election and measurement  to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill in  our reporting units were comprised of retail  commercial  cre  household lending  cib  w im  and affordable housing 
in the first quarter of  we wrote off all of the goodwill of the cre  household lending  and affordable housing reporting units in connection with our goodwill impairment analysis 
in the second quarter of  we changed our business segments 
among other changes  portions of the cib segment  such as middle market  asset based lending  and equipment leasing were moved to the diversified commercial banking segment  resulting in the allocation of approximately million in goodwill from the cib reporting unit to the commercial reporting unit  which was renamed the diversified commercial banking reporting unit 
the retail reporting unit was renamed branch banking  however  the composition of the reporting unit did not change 
branch banking is a component of the retail banking reportable segment 
as of december   the reporting units with goodwill balances are branch banking  diversified commercial banking  cib  and w im 
see note  business segment reporting  to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the changes to our reportable segments 
we review the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis  or more often  if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity 
the goodwill impairment analysis estimates the fair value of equity using discounted cash flow analyses which require assumptions  as well as guideline company and guideline transaction information  where available 
the inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations including projections of future cash flows  discount rates  the fair value of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  and applicable valuation multiples based on the guideline information 
we assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the reporting units by giving consideration to our market capitalization over a reasonable period of time  however  supplemental information is applied based on observable multiples from guideline transactions  adjusting to reflect our specific factors  as well as current market conditions 
based on our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of september   we believe that the fair value for all reporting units is substantially in excess of the respective reporting unit s carrying value 
valuation techniques in determining the fair value of our reporting units  we primarily use discounted cash flow analyses  which require assumptions about short and long term net cash flow growth rates for each reporting unit  as well as discount rates 
in addition  we consider guideline company and guideline transaction information  where available  to aid in the valuation of certain reporting units 
growth assumptions multi year financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several key business drivers such as new business initiatives  client service and retention standards  market share changes  anticipated loan and deposit growth  forward interest rates  historical performance  and industry and economic trends  among other considerations 
the long term growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was estimated at in and based on management s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit  as well as broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product and inflation 

table of contents discount rate assumptions discount rates are estimated based on the capital asset pricing model  which considers the risk free interest rate  market risk premium  beta  and in some cases  unsystematic risk and size premium adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit 
the discount rates are also calibrated based on the assessment of the risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit 
in the annual analysis as of september   the discount rates ranged from to 
estimated fair value and sensitivities the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is derived from the valuation techniques described above 
the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is analyzed in relation to numerous market and historical factors  including current economic and market conditions  marketplace dynamics such as level of short selling  company specific growth opportunities  and guideline company and guideline transaction information 
economic and market conditions can vary significantly which may cause increased volatility in a company s stock price  resulting in a temporary decline in market capitalization 
in those circumstances  current market capitalization may not be an accurate indication of a market participant s estimate of entity specific value measured over a reasonable period of time 
we believe that this volatility may be tied to market sentiment pertaining to the overall banking sector and concerns regarding dilution of common shareholders  rather than the result of company specific adjustments to cash flows  guideline multiples  or asset values which would have influenced the fair value of reporting units 
as a result  the use of market capitalization has become a less relevant measure to assess the reasonableness of the aggregate value of the reporting units 
therefore  we supplement the market capitalization information with other observable market information that provided benchmark valuation multiples from transactions over a reasonable period 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions  therefore  in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value 
we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values 
ultimately  future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value 
additionally  a reporting unit s carrying value of equity could change based on market conditions and the risk profile of those reporting units 
if there is a situation where the carrying value of equity exceeds the estimated fair value  an additional goodwill impairment evaluation is performed which involves calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill is recognized in a business combination 
the fair value of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities  including previously unrecognized intangible assets  is individually determined 
significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets is the implied goodwill 
the value of the implied goodwill is highly sensitive to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit s net assets 
the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets is estimated using a variety of valuation techniques including the following recent data observed in the market  including similar assets cash flow modeling based on projected cash flows and market discount rates market indices estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral price indications from independent third parties observable market information is utilized to the extent available and relevant 
the estimated fair values reflect management s assumptions regarding how a market participant would value the net assets and includes appropriate credit  liquidity  and market risk premiums that are indicative of the current environment 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the goodwill for the respective reporting unit  no goodwill impairment is recorded 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
changes in the estimated fair value of the individual assets and liabilities may result in a different amount of implied goodwill  and ultimately the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the potential ranges of implied goodwill 

table of contents the size of the implied goodwill is significantly affected by the estimated fair value of loans 
the estimated fair value of a loan portfolio is based on an exit price  and the assumptions used are intended to approximate those that a market participant would use in valuing the loans in an orderly transaction  including a market liquidity discount 
future changes in the fair value of a reporting unit s net assets could result in future goodwill impairment 
for example  to the extent there are significant market risk premiums and the fair value of the individual assets of a reporting unit increases at a faster rate than the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  that may cause the implied goodwill of a reporting unit to be lower than the carrying value of goodwill  resulting in goodwill impairment 
income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business and estimate income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to these various tax jurisdictions 
the estimated income tax expense benefit is reported in the consolidated statements of income loss 
the evaluation pertaining to the tax expense and related tax asset and liability balances involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity around the ultimate measurement and resolution of these matters 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future and are reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes  regulations  judicial precedent and other pertinent information and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation 
changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax laws  the status of examinations by the tax authorities and newly enacted statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits of tax positions 
these changes  when they occur  impact accrued taxes and can materially affect our operating results 
we regularly evaluate our uncertain tax positions and estimate the appropriate level of utbs related to each of these positions 
we regularly evaluate the realizability of deferred tax asset positions 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary  we consider the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws  as well as estimates of future pre tax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would  if necessary  be implemented 
we currently maintain a valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets for certain state carryforwards generated by our subsidiaries 
we expect to realize our remaining deferred tax assets over the allowable carryback and or carryforward periods 
therefore  no valuation allowance is deemed necessary against our federal or remaining state deferred tax assets as of december  for additional information  refer to note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements 
pension accounting several variables affect the annual variability of cost for our retirement programs 
the main variables are size and characteristics of the employee population  discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  recognition of actual asset returns  other actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost 
below is a brief description of these variables and the effect they have on our pension costs 
size and characteristics of the employee population pension cost is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plans  and other factors including salary  age  years of employment  and benefit terms 
effective january   retirement plan participants who were employed as of december  ceased to accrue additional benefits under the existing pension benefit formula and their accrued benefits were frozen 
beginning january   participants who had fewer than years of service and future participants accrue future pension benefits under a cash balance formula that provides compensation and interest credits to a personal pension account 
participants with or more years of service as of december  were given the opportunity to choose between continuing a traditional pension benefit accrual under a reduced formula or participating in the new personal pension account 
see note  employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for plan changes effective january  that will impact plan assumptions during 
table of contents discount rate the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations 
the discount rate for each plan is determined by matching the expected cash flows of each plan to a yield curve based on long term  high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date  december  the discount rate for each plan is reset annually or upon occurrence of a triggering event on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions 
if we were to assume a increase decrease in the discount rate for all retirement and other postretirement plans  and keep all other assumptions constant  the benefit cost would decrease increase by approximately million 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets based on historical experience  market projections  and the target asset allocation set forth in the investment policy for the retirement plans  the pre tax expected rate of return on plan assets was for this expected rate of return is dependent upon the asset allocation decisions made with respect to plan assets 
annual differences  if any  between expected and actual returns are included in the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount 
we generally amortize any unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in excess of a corridor in net periodic pension expense over the average future service of active employees  which is approximately eight years  or average future lifetime for plans that are frozen or have no active participants 
see note  employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 
if we were to assume a increase decrease in the expected long term rate of return for the retirement and other postretirement plans  holding all other actuarial assumptions constant  the benefit cost would decrease increase by approximately million 
recognition of actual asset returns accounting guidance allows for the use of an asset value that smoothes investment gains and losses over a period up to five years 
however  we have elected to use a preferable method in determining pension cost 
this method uses the actual market value of the plan assets 
therefore  we will experience more variability in the annual pension cost  as the asset values will be more volatile than companies who elected to smooth their investment experience 
other actuarial assumptions to estimate the projected benefit obligation  actuarial assumptions are required about factors such as mortality rate  turnover rate  retirement rate  disability rate  and the rate of compensation increases 
these factors do not tend to change significantly over time  so the range of assumptions  and their impact on pension cost  is generally limited 
we annually review the assumptions used based on historical and expected future experience 
the interest crediting rate applied to each personal pension account was an annual effective rate of for healthcare cost assumed healthcare cost trend rates also have an impact on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans 
due to changing medical inflation  it is important to understand the effect of a one percent change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates 
if we were to assume a one percent increase in healthcare cost trend rates  the effect on the other postretirement benefit obligation and total interest and service cost would be a million and million increase  respectively 
if we were to assume a one percent decrease in healthcare trend rates  the effect on the other postretirement benefit obligation and total interest and service cost would be an million and million decrease  respectively 
to estimate the projected benefit obligation as of december   we projected forward the benefit obligations from january  to december   adjusting for benefit payments  expected growth in the benefit obligations  changes in key assumptions and plan provisions  and any significant changes in the plan demographics that occurred during the year  including where appropriate subsidized early retirements  salary changes different from expectations  entrance of new participants  changes in per capita claims cost  medicare part d subsidy  and retiree contributions
