item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations plasma volume expander products our operating revenues have been derived almost exclusively from royalties and licensing fees related to our plasma volume expander products  primarily hextend 
hextend has become the standard plasma volume expander at a number of prominent teaching hospitals and leading medical centers and is part of the tactical combat casualty care protocol 
we believe that as the decision to use hextend proliferates within leading us hospitals  other smaller hospitals will follow this trend  contributing to sales growth 
under our license agreements  hospira and cj will report sales of hextend and pay us the royalties and license fees due on account of such sales after the end of each calendar quarter 
we recognize such revenues in the quarter in which the sales report is received  rather than the quarter in which the sales took place 

table of contents royalties on sales of hextend that occurred during the fourth quarter of through the third quarter of are reflected in our financial statements for the year ended december  we received  in royalties from hextend sales by hospira during royalties for decreased from  in royalties from hospira on hextend sales in  largely due to a decrease in sales to the military 
in addition  we received royalties from cj in the amount of  for the period ended december   representing a increase from  in royalties received for the period ended december  based on sales of hextend that occurred during the fourth quarter of  we received royalties of  from hospira and  from cj during the first quarter of total royalties of  for the quarter decreased from royalties of  received during the same period last year 
these royalties will be reflected in our financial statements for the first quarter of the decrease in royalties received from hospira based on sales during the third and fourth quarters of is generally due to a decrease in sales to the united states armed forces  which was partially offset by an increase in sales to hospitals 
purchases by the armed forces generally take the form of intermittent  large volume orders  and cannot be predicted with certainty 
hospira has reported that the armed forces have shifted the primary point of use of hextend from the field to the hospital level  which may account for some decrease in overall sales 
this change was made due to the fact that too much of the product was being distributed to ground troops for inclusion in field packs and was going unused beyond the expiration date  so a different pattern of distribution was deemed advisable 
during the year ended december   we received  from summit for the right to co develop hextend and pentalyte in japan  china  and taiwan 
a portion of the cash payment is a partial reimbursement of biotime s development costs of hextend and a portion is a partial reimbursement of biotime s development costs of pentalyte 
this payment is reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue

we are in the process of launching our first products for stem cell research and cannot yet predict the amount of revenue that may be generated by these new products 
we did not receive significant revenues from stem cell product sales during we have also targeted for development espy cell lines  which will be derivatives of hes cells that will emit beacons of light 
these light emitting cells will allow researchers to track the location and distribution of the cells in both in vitro and in vivo studies 
as new products are developed  they will become available for purchase on embryome

research and development programs in regenerative medicine and stem cell research we entered the fields of stem cell research and regenerative medicine during october from that time through  our activities in those fields included acquiring rights to market stem cell lines  pursuing patents  planning future products and research programs  applying for research grants  identifying the characteristics of various acquired progenitor and stem cell lines  negotiating a product distribution agreement  organizing new subsidiaries to address particular fields of product development  and planning and launching our first product development programs 
the following table summarizes the most significant achievements in our primary research and development programs in stem cell research and regenerative medicine  and the amount we spent on those programs during the last fiscal year

embryome sciences cirm funded research project addressing the need for industrial scale production of purified therapeutic cells conducted long term stability studies of hepcs using commercial type culture processes to demonstrate phenotypic stability and genotypic stability during culture expansion 
attempting to define a molecular signature of cell surface markers that would be unique to a given hepc cell line to permit development of reagents to those markers that can be used to purify the target hepcs intended for therapy 
mapping cell surface protein expression directly on hepcs using large collections of commercially available antibodies and have begun testing those antibodies as affinity reagents for purifying target hepcs 
identifying peptide reagents that show specificity for cell surface targets on hepcs and could thus be used directly as affinity reagents 
oncocyte vascular endothelial cells that can be engineered to deliver a toxic payload to the developing blood vessels of a tumor developed a derivation protocol that can reproducibly produce populations of endothelial type cells with levels of purity and efficiency far above those reported in the published literature 
established broad range of support assays to monitor and measure vascular endothelial cell differentiation process

table of contents the inherent uncertainties of developing new products for stem cell research and for medical use make it impossible to predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to complete the development and commence commercialization of new products 
there is no assurance that we or any of our subsidiaries will be successful in developing new technologies or stem cell products  or that any technology or products that may be developed will be proven safe and effective for treating diseases in humans  or will be successfully commercialized 
most of our potential therapeutic products are at a very early stage of preclinical development 
before any clinical trials can be conducted by us or any of our subsidiaries  the company seeking to conduct the trials would have to compile sufficient laboratory test data substantiating the characteristics and purity of the stem cells  conduct animal studies  and then obtain all necessary regulatory and clinical trial site approvals  after which a team of physicians and statisticians would need to be assembled to perform the trials 
clinical trials will be costly to undertake and will take years to complete

table of contents critical accounting policies revenue recognition we comply with sec staff accounting bulletin guidance on revenue recognition 
royalty and license fee revenues consist of product royalty payments and fees under license agreements and are recognized when earned and reasonably estimable 
we recognize revenue in the quarter in which the royalty report is received rather than the quarter in which the sales took place 
when we are entitled to receive up front nonrefundable licensing or similar fees pursuant to agreements under which we have no continuing performance obligations  the fees are recognized as revenues when collection is reasonably assured 
when we receive up front nonrefundable licensing or similar fees pursuant to agreements under which we do have continuing performance obligations  the fees are deferred and amortized ratably over the performance period 
if the performance period cannot be reasonably estimated  we amortize nonrefundable fees over the life of the contract until such time that the performance period can be more reasonably estimated 
milestone payments  if any  related to scientific or technical achievements are recognized in income when the milestone is accomplished if a substantive effort was required to achieve the milestone  b the amount of the milestone payment appears reasonably commensurate with the effort expended  and c collection of the payment is reasonably assured 
grant income is recognized as revenue when earned 
patent costs costs associated with obtaining patents on products or technology developed are expensed as general and administrative expenses when incurred 
this accounting is in compliance with guidance promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 
research and development we comply with fasb requirements governing accounting for research and development costs 
research and development costs are expensed when incurred  and consist principally of salaries  payroll taxes  research and laboratory fees  and license fees paid to acquire patents or licenses to use patents and other technology from third parties 
stock based compensation we have adopted accounting standards governing share based payments  which require the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to directors and employees  including employee stock options  based on estimated fair values 
we utilize the black scholes merton option pricing model 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and the actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the risk free rate is based on the united states treasury rates in effect during the corresponding period of grant 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with recent fasb guidance  changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value 
in management opinion  the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of employee stock options because the option pricing model value may not be indicative of the fair value that would be established in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets  including intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
if an impairment indicator is present  we evaluate recoverability by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if the assets are impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
deferred license and consulting fees deferred license and consulting fees consist of  attributable to the value of warrants issued to third parties for services and to the minority shareholder in biotime asia for its participation in the organization of that company  and  in deferred license fees paid to acquire rights to use the proprietary technologies of third parties 
the value of the warrants is being amortized over the lives of the warrants  and deferred license fees over the estimated useful lives of the licensed technologies or licensed research products 
the estimation of the useful life any technology or product involves a significant degree of inherent uncertainty  since the outcome of research and development or the commercial life of a new product cannot be known with certainty at the time that the right to use the technology or product is acquired 
we will review its amortization schedules for impairments that might occur earlier than the original expected useful lives

table of contents results of operations under our license agreements with hospira and cj  our licensees report sales of hextend and pay us the royalties and license fees due on account of such sales within days after the end of each calendar quarter 
we recognize such revenues in the quarter in which the sales report is received  rather than the quarter in which the sales took place  as we do not have sufficient sales history to accurately predict quarterly sales 
for example  royalties on sales made during the fourth quarter of were not recognized until the first quarter of fiscal year year ended december  and year ended december  our royalty revenues for the year ended december  consist of royalties on sales of hextend made by hospira and cj during the period beginning october  and ending september  royalty revenues recognized for that period were  compared with  recognized for the year ended december  this decrease in royalties is attributable to a decrease in hextend sales in the united states  which was slightly offset by an increase in sales in the republic of korea 
the decrease in sales in the us market is primarily due to a decrease in sales to the us armed forces 
purchases by the armed forces generally take the form of intermittent  large volume orders  and cannot be predicted with certainty 
hospira has reported that the armed forces have shifted primary point of use of hextend from the field to the hospital level  which may account for some decrease in overall sales 
this change was made due to the fact that too much of the product was being distributed to ground troops for inclusion in field packs and was going unused beyond the expiration date  so a different pattern of distribution was deemed advisable 
we recognized as revenue  and  of license fees from cj and summit during and  respectively 
the license fees were received from cj during april and july  and from summit during december and april and october of  but full recognition of the license fees has been deferred  and is being recognized over the life of the contract  which has been estimated to last until approximately based on the current expected life of the governing patent covering our products in korea and japan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we received four quarterly payments totaling  from our research grant from cirm during the year ended december  because grant income is recognized as revenue when earned  and these amounts received covered the period of march  through february   only  earned during the fiscal year was recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
total grant income recognized during the year amounted to  which includes  of a payment received in but that was recognized as revenues in we received  of the  grant awarded to us under the us government qualifying therapeutic discovery project qtdp 
the remainder of the award was received in february the qtdp was part of the patient protection and affordable care act signed into law on march  the grants awarded biotime were for the maximum amount allowed for three of our programs orthopedic product development  our actcellerate platform  and our recyte ips program 

table of contents research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  for  research and development expenses also included  of research and development expense incurred by esi and cell cure neurosciences  of which  is derived from the amortization of patent technology related to our acquisition of those subsidiaries during the year 
also  during the year ended december   biotime modified its procedure for amortizing deferred license fees 
as a result  research and development expenses for include an additional  representing amortization of deferred license fees not previously recorded in and aside from those expenses  the increase in research and development expense during is primarily attributable to an increase of  in employee compensation and related costs allocated to research and development expense  an increase of  in scientific consulting fees  an increase of  in stock based compensation allocated to research and development expense  an increase of  of travel and related costs allocated to research and development expenses  an increase of  in outside research and laboratory costs  and an increase of  in expenditures made to cover laboratory expenses and supplies 
the increase in the amount we spent on research and development during reflects in part the greater amount of grant payments we received during compared to research and development expenses include laboratory study expenses  patent and technology license fees  salaries  rent  insurance  and science related consultants fees 
general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  for  general and administrative expenses also included  of general and administrative expense incurred by esi and cell cure neurosciences  which we acquired during the year 
the increase is further attributable to increase of  in employee compensation  bonuses and related costs allocated to general and administrative expense   in stock appreciation rights compensation liability  an increase of  in cash and stock based compensation paid to our independent directors  an increase of  in legal fees and general and administrative patent expenses  an increase of  in accounting fees and an increase of  in investor and public relations expenses 
general and administrative expenses include salaries allocated to general and administrative accounts  consulting fees other than those paid for science related consulting  expenditures for patent costs  trademark expenses  insurance costs allocated to general and administrative expenses  stock exchange related costs  depreciation expense  shipping expenses  marketing costs  and other miscellaneous expenses 

table of contents year ended december  and year ended december  our royalty revenues for the year ended december  consist of royalties on sales of hextend made by hospira and cj during the period beginning october  and ending september  royalty revenues recognized for that period were  compared with  recognized for the year ended december  this decrease in royalties is attributable to a decrease in hextend sales in the united states  which was slightly offset by an increase in sales in the republic of korea 
the decrease in sales in the us market is primarily due to a decrease in sales to the us armed forces 
purchases by the armed forces generally take the form of intermittent  large volume orders  and cannot be predicted with certainty 
royalties from sales of hextend by cj were included in license fees during we received the first two quarterly payments  totaling  from our research grant from cirm in the second half of because grant income is recognized as revenue when earned  and the amounts received covered the period of september  through february   only  earned through december  was recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
we recognized as revenue  and  of license fees from cj and summit during and  respectively 
the license fees were received from cj during april and july  and from summit during december and april and october of  but full recognition of the license fees has been deferred  and is being recognized over the life of the contract  which has been estimated to last until approximately based on the current expected life of the governing patent covering our products in korea and japan 
royalties of  from hextend sales by cj were included in license fees during see note to the consolidated financial statements 
research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to our entry into the stem cell field  and includes increases of approximately  in salaries and other payroll related expenses charged to research and development   in employee bonus amounts allocated to research and development   in rent charged to research and development   in laboratory expense and laboratory supplies   in outside research expenses   in expense associated with stock based compensation allocated to research and development   in scientific consulting fees  and  in fringe benefit costs allocated to research and development expense 
the increase in the amount we spent on research and development during reflects in part our receipt of research grant payments from cirm 
research and development expenses during and included laboratory study expenses  salaries  rent  insurance  and science related consultants fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this change reflects decreases of approximately  in general and administrative consulting expenses   in stock based compensation expenses charged to general and administrative expense  and  in stock appreciation rights compensation expenses 
these decreases were offset to some extent by increases of approximately  in stock based compensation paid to our independent directors   in cash compensation paid to our independent directors   in stock related expenses   in annual report and meeting expenses   in investor public relations expenses   in rent allocated to general and administration expenses   in travel and entertainment expenses   in legal expenses   in outside services expenses   in salaries and other payroll related expenses   in employee bonus amounts allocated to general and administrative expense   in accounting expenses   in taxes allocated to general and administrative expense  and  in patent expenses 
general and administrative expenses include salaries allocated to general and administrative accounts  consulting fees other than those paid for science related consulting  expenditures for patent costs  trademark expenses  insurance costs allocated to general and administrative expenses  stock exchange related costs  depreciation expense  shipping expenses  marketing costs  and other miscellaneous expenses 
stock based compensation increased during in large part due to our common shares trading at prices higher than the prices that prevailed during 
table of contents interest and other income expense our interest expense decreased by approximately million during  primarily due to full repayment of our borrowings under the various lines of credit in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during we recognized  in costs for the modification of stock purchase warrants that expired on november  we offered a discounted exercise price of per share to the holders of the warrants with an original strike price of per share 
the warrant discount offer commenced on june   and expired at pm  new york time  on august  taxes at december  we had a cumulative net operating loss carryforward of approximately  for federal income tax purposes and  for state income tax purposes 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate because we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  as we do not consider realization to be more likely than not 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   we had  of cash and cash equivalents on hand 
we may need to obtain additional debt or equity capital in order to finance our operations 
since inception  we have primarily financed our operations through the sale of equity securities  licensing fees  royalties on product sales by our licensees  and borrowings 
the amount of revenue that may be earned through the licensing and sale of our products and technology  the timing of the receipt of license fee and royalty payments  and the future availability and terms of equity financing  are uncertain 
although we have recently been awarded research grants from cirm and qtdp for particular projects  and our subsidiary cell cure neurosciences has received research grants from the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of industry  trade and labor in israel  we must finance our other research and operations with funding from other sources 
we presently have issued and outstanding  common share purchase warrants  of which  are exercisable at a price of per share   at per share  and the remaining  at per share 
these warrants expire on various dates ranging from september to may none of the warrants are publicly traded 
the unavailability or inadequacy of financing or revenues to meet future capital needs could force us to modify  curtail  delay  or suspend some or all aspects of our planned operations 
sales of additional equity securities could result in the dilution of the interests of present shareholders 
cash generated by operations during  we received  of cash in our operations 
our sources of that cash were  of royalty revenues from hospira   of royalty revenues from cj  a  research grant payment from the nih  a  payment from a qtdp research grant  and a  research grant payment from cirm 
cash used in operations during  our total research and development expenditures were  and our general and administrative expenditures were  net loss for the year ended december  amounted to  net cash used in operating activities during this period amounted to  the difference between the net loss and net cash used in operating activities during was primarily attributable to  in stock based compensation paid to employees and consultants  amortization of  in intangible assets   in options issued as independent director compensation   amortization of deferred consulting fees   amortization of deferred license fees   in depreciation expense   in costs for the modification of warrants  and a  share in the net loss of cell cure neurosciences 
this overall difference was offset to some extent by amortization of  in deferred license revenues   in grants receivable   in prepaid expenses and other current assets  and net loss of  allocable to the noncontrolling interest in our subsidiaries 

table of contents cash flows from investing activities during the year ended december    was used for investing activities 
the primary components of this cash were approximately  invested in cell cure neurosciences shares   used in the purchase of equipment   used to pay license fees  and  used in the acquisition of esi 
cash generated by financing activities during the year ended december    in net cash was provided from our financing activities 
during this period  we received  in connection with the exercise of  options   in connection with the exercise of  warrants  and  from issuance of recyte common shares 
contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter were as follows principal payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases this table does not include payments to key employees that could arise if they were involuntary terminated or if their employment terminated following a change in control 
includes the lease of our principal office and laboratory facilities in alameda  california  and leases of the offices and laboratory facilities of our subsidiaries esi and cell cure neurosciences 

table of contents future capital needs we will depend upon revenue from the sale of our research products  royalties from the sale of hextend by hospira and cj  and our research grants from cirm and qtdp as our principal sources of revenues for the near future 
our product sales and royalty revenues will be supplemented by any license fees that we may receive if we enter into new commercial license agreements for our products or technology 
millipore and genext began marketing some of our hepc lines an espan growth media during  but it is too early to predict future revenues from the sale of our stem cell research products by them 
the amount and pace of research and development work that we can do or sponsor  and our ability to commence and complete the clinical trials that are required in order for us to obtain fda and foreign regulatory approval of products  depend upon the amount of money we have 
we curtailed the pace and scope of our plasma volume expander development efforts due to the limited amount of funds available 
future research and clinical study costs are not presently determinable due to many factors  including the inherent uncertainty of these costs and the uncertainty as to timing  source  and amount of capital that will become available for these projects 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to some foreign exchange currency risks because we have subsidiaries that are located in foreign countries 
we do not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
because we translate foreign currencies into united states dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations have an impact on our financial results 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is mitigated by the fact that our foreign subsidiaries pay their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currency 
as of december   currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our intercompany transactions with our foreign subsidiaries 
however  a weakening of the dollar against the foreign exchange used in the home countries of our foreign subsidiaries could increase our cost of providing additional financing to our foreign subsidiaries in the future 
conversely  a strengthening of the dollar would decrease our cost of making additional investments in those subsidiaries 
much of the foreign currency translation gain recognized as of december  is derived from the translation of the subsidiary accounts for consolidation purposes 

table of contents credit risk we place most of our cash in united states banks and we invest some of our cash in interest bearing instruments issued by united states banks or the united states treasury 
deposits with banks may temporarily exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
we monitor the cash balances in our accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  but if the amount of a deposit at any time exceeds the federally insured amount at a bank  the uninsured portion of the deposit could be lost  in whole or in part  if the bank were to fail 
our foreign subsidiaries deposit their cash in local banks  but if the amount of a deposit at any time exceeds the amount at a bank under the national banking insurance laws  the uninsured portion of the deposit could be lost  in whole or in part  if the bank were to fail 
interest rate risk we invest a portion of our cash in interest bearing securities issued by the united states treasury 
the primary objective of our investments is to preserve principal and liquidity while earning a return on our invested capital  without incurring significant risks 
the market value of fixed rate instruments will decline if interest rates rise 
due in part to this factor  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in market conditions and in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which may have declined in fair value due to changes in interest rates 

table of contents report of independent registered public accounting firm to the board of directors and stockholders of biotime  inc we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of biotime  inc and subsidiaries collectively  the company as of december   and the related consolidated statements of operations  changes in equity  and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended december  we have also audited the company s internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 
the company s management is responsible for these financial statements  for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting  and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting  included in the accompanying management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits 
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states 
those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects 
our audits of the financial statements included examining  on a test basis  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements  assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation 
our audit over internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting  assessing the risk that a material weakness exists  and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk 
our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances 
we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion 
a company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use  or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
in our opinion  the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly  in all material respects  the financial position of biotime  inc and subsidiaries as of december   and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended december  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america
