we intend to elect to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the code  commencing with our taxable year ending december  our investment strategy we invest in industrial properties located in six major coastal us markets los angeles area  northern new jersey new york city  san francisco bay area  seattle area  miami area  and washington  dc baltimore

table of contents r d and trans shipment 
we target functional buildings in infill locations that may be shared by multiple tenants and that cater to customer demand within the various submarkets in which we operate 
we selected our target markets by drawing upon the experiences of our management team investing and operating in over global industrial markets located in north america  europe and asia and in anticipation of trends in logistics patterns resulting from population changes  regulatory and physical constraints  potential long term increases in carbon prices and other factors 
we believe that our target markets have attractive long term investment attributes 
we target assets with characteristics that include  but are not limited to  the following located in high population coastal markets  close proximity to transportation infrastructure such as sea ports  airports  highways and railways  situated in supply constrained submarkets with barriers to new industrial development  as a result of physical and or regulatory constraints  functional and flexible layout that can be modified to accommodate single and multiple tenants  acquisition price at a significant discount to the replacement cost of the property  potential for enhanced return through re tenanting or operational improvements  and opportunity for higher and better use of the property over time 
in general  we utilize local third party property managers for day to day property management 
we believe outsourcing property management is cost effective and provides us with operational flexibility to scale our investments within any chosen market 
we currently manage one of our properties directly and may directly manage other properties in the future if we determine such direct property management is in our best interest 
while not prohibited from doing so  we have no current intention to acquire industrial land or to pursue ground up development 
however  we may pursue redevelopment opportunities of properties that we own 
we expect the significant majority of our investments will be equity interests in individual properties or portfolios of properties 
we may also acquire industrial properties through the acquisition of other corporations or entities that own industrial real estate 
we will opportunistically target investments in debt secured by industrial real estate that would otherwise meet our investment criteria with the intention of ultimately acquiring the underlying real estate 
we currently do not intend to target specific percentages of holdings of particular types of industrial properties 
this expectation is based upon prevailing market conditions and may change over time in response to different prevailing market conditions 
we acquire assets based on their anticipated total return  which consists of income and any capital appreciation 
we currently expect to be a long term owner in our properties  but we may sell properties at any time  subject to reit provisions of the code  including the prohibited transaction rules  if our management determines it is in our best interests to do so 
developments on february   we completed both our initial public offering of  shares of our common stock and a concurrent private placement of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to our executive officers at a price per share of 
the net proceeds of our initial public offering were approximately million after deducting the full underwriting discount of approximately million and other estimated offering expenses of approximately million 
the underwriters agreed to forego the receipt of payment of per share  or approximately million in the aggregate  until such time as we purchase assets in accordance with our investment strategy described in this annual report on form k  with an aggregate purchase price including the amount of any outstanding indebtedness assumed or incurred by us at least equal to the net proceeds from our initial public offering after deducting the full underwriting discount and other estimated offering expenses payable by us  at which time  we have agreed to pay the underwriters the remainder of the underwriting discount 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from our concurrent private placement 
in the aggregate  we had 
table of contents approximately million in cash available to execute our business strategy upon completion of our initial public offering and the concurrent private placement on february  during the period from february  commencement of operations to december   we acquired industrial buildings containing approximately million square feet 
the total aggregate investment was approximately million  which includes approximately million in below market leases and mortgage premium intangible assets 
the properties were acquired from unrelated third parties using existing cash on hand  net of assumed mortgage loans payable

on march   we consummated a million senior revolving credit facility the facility that matures on march  to finance acquisitions and for working capital requirements 
on december   we entered into an amendment to our facility to increase the facility to million by exercising the accordion feature under our facility 
the amount available under our facility may be increased up to million  subject to the approval of the administrative agent and the identification of lenders willing to make available additional amounts 
outstanding borrowings under our facility are limited to the lesser of million or of the value of the borrowing base properties 
we have agreed to guarantee the obligations of the borrower a wholly owned subsidiary under our facility 
as of december  there were no amounts outstanding under our facility and five properties were in the borrowing base 
during the period from february  commencement of operations to december   we assumed two mortgage loans payable totaling approximately million  including mortgage premiums of approximately million 
these mortgage loans bear interest at a weighted average fixed annual interest rate of and mature between and recent developments on february   our board of directors authorized us to declare a cash dividend in the amount of per share of our common stock payable on april  to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on april  subsequent to december   we entered into one contract with a third party seller to acquire one industrial property consisting of one building located in washington dc baltimore 
the property aggregates approximately  square feet for a purchase price of approximately million 
there is no assurance that we 
table of contents will acquire the property under contract because the proposed acquisition is subject to a variety of factors  including the satisfaction of customary closing conditions 
outlook the primary source of our operating revenues and earnings is rents received from tenants under operating leases at our properties  including reimbursements from tenants for certain operating costs 
we seek long term earnings growth primarily through increasing rents and operating income at existing properties and acquiring properties in our six target markets 
we intend to seek to grow our portfolio by utilizing one or more of cash on hand  future borrowings under our facility  future sales of common or preferred equity and future placements of secured or unsecured debt 
inflation although the us economy has been experiencing relatively flat inflation rates recently  and a wide variety of industries and sectors are affected differently by changing commodity prices  inflation has not had a significant impact on us in our markets of operation 
most of our leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  many of our outstanding leases expire within five years which enables us to replace existing leases with new leases at the then existing market rate 
financial condition and results of operations we commenced operations upon the completion of our initial public offering and the concurrent private placement on february  revenue

table of contents net loss 
we incurred a net loss of million for the period from february  commencement of operations to december  liquidity and capital resources the primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain financial flexibility with a conservative capital structure using retained cash flows  long term debt and the issuance of common and perpetual preferred stock to finance our growth 
over the long term  we intend to limit the sum of the outstanding principal amount of our consolidated indebtedness and the liquidation preference of any outstanding perpetual preferred stock to less than of our total enterprise value  maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of x  limit the principal amount of our outstanding floating rate debt to less than of our total consolidated indebtedness  and have staggered debt maturities that are aligned to our expected average lease term years  positioning us to re price parts of our capital structure as our rental rates change with market conditions 
we intend to preserve a flexible capital structure with a long term goal to obtain an investment grade rating and be in a position to issue unsecured debt and perpetual preferred stock 
prior to attaining an investment grade rating  we intend to primarily utilize non recourse debt secured by individual properties or pools of properties with a targeted maximum loan to value of at the time of financing  or recourse bank term loans and credit facilities 
we may also assume debt in connection with property acquisitions which may have a higher loan to value 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements  consisting primarily of investments related to growing our business  including acquisitions  generally through net cash provided by operations  existing cash balances and  if necessary  short term borrowings under our facility 
we believe that our net cash provided by operations will be adequate to fund operating requirements  pay interest on any borrowings and fund distributions in accordance with the reit requirements of the federal income tax laws 
in the near term  we intend to fund future investments in properties with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the concurrent private placement 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  including with respect to other investments in industrial properties  property acquisitions and scheduled debt maturities  through the cash we have available from our initial public offering and the concurrent private placement and borrowings under our facility and periodic issuances of common stock  perpetual preferred stock  and long term secured and unsecured debt 
the success of our acquisition strategy may depend  in part  on our ability to obtain and borrow under our facility and to access additional capital through issuances of equity and debt securities 
on february   we completed our initial public offering with the issuance of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share and a concurrent private placement of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share

critical accounting policies below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are critical 
we consider these policies critical because they require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain  involve various assumptions and require significant management judgment  and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
these judgments will affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
applying different estimates or assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in our financial statements 
property acquisitions 
upon acquisition of a property  we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land  buildings and improvements and intangible assets and liabilities consisting of the above and below market leases and the origination value of all in place leases 
we determine fair values using estimated cash flow projections and other valuation techniques and applying appropriate discount and capitalization rates based on available market information 
the fair value of the tangible assets is based on the value of the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land and buildings and improvements 
land values are derived from current comparative sales values  when available  or management s estimates of the fair value based on market conditions and the experience of our management team 
building values are calculated as replacement cost less depreciation or management s estimates of the fair value of these assets using discounted cash flows analyses or similar methods 
the fair value of the above and below market leases is based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the acquired leases using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases and our estimate of the market lease rates measured over a period equal to the remaining noncancelable term of the leases 
the capitalized values of above market leases and below market leases are amortized to rental revenue over the remaining noncancelable term of the respective leases 
the origination value of in place leases is based on costs to execute similar leases including commissions and other related costs 
the origination value of in place leases also includes real estate taxes  insurance and an estimate of lost rent revenue at market rates during the estimated time required to lease up the property from vacant to the occupancy level at the date of acquisition 
impairment 
carrying values for financial reporting purposes will be reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable 
when the carrying value of a property or land parcel is greater than its estimated fair value  based on the intended use and holding period  an impairment charge to earnings is recognized for the excess over its estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the intended use of an asset  either held for sale or held for the long term  can significantly impact how impairment is measured 
if an asset is intended to be held for the long term  the impairment analysis is based on a two step test 
the first test measures estimated expected future cash flows over the holding period  including a residual value undiscounted and without interest charges  against the carrying value of the property 
if the asset fails the test  then the asset carrying value is measured against the lower of cost or the present value of expected cash flows over the expected hold period 
an impairment charge to earnings is recognized for the excess of the asset s carrying value over the lower of cost or the present values of expected cash flows over the expected hold period 
if an asset is intended to be sold  impairment will be determined using the estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions  among other things  regarding current and future economic and market conditions and the availability of capital 
we determine the estimated fair values based on our assumptions regarding rental rates  
table of contents lease up and holding periods  as well as sales prices 
when available  current market information is used to determine capitalization and rental growth rates 
if available  current comparative sales values may also be used to establish fair value 
when market information is not readily available  the inputs are based on our understanding of market conditions and the experience of the management team 
actual results could differ significantly from our estimates 
the discount rates used in the fair value estimates will represent a rate commensurate with the indicated holding period with a premium layered on for risk 
revenue recognition 
we record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the noncancelable leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make required payments 
if tenants fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts  security deposits and letters of credit  then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods 
we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate 
each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable  including straight line rents  for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed 
we also record lease termination fees when a tenant has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us 
if a tenant remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement  the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such tenants occupancy 
income taxes 
we intend to elect to be taxed as a reit under the code and intend to operate as such beginning with our taxable year that ended on december  to qualify as a reit  we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement to distribute at least of our annual reit taxable income to our stockholders which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we distribute qualifying dividends to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the irs grants us relief under certain statutory provisions 
such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders 
however  we believe we are organized and have operated in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a reit 
stock based compensation 
the company follows the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation  to account for its stock based compensation plan  which requires that the compensation cost relating to stock based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and that the cost be measured on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we have adopted the equity plan  which provides for the grant of restricted stock awards  performance share awards  unrestricted shares or any combination of the foregoing 
stock based compensation is recognized as an expense in the financial statements and measured at the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected behavior 
the amount of the expense may be subject to adjustment in future periods depending on the specific characteristics of the stock based award and the application of the accounting guidance 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than an operating lease for office space 
contractual obligations as described above  the full amount of the underwriting discount in connection with our initial public offering was approximately million 
the underwriters agreed to forego the receipt of payment of per share  or approximately million in the aggregate  until such time as we purchase assets in accordance with our investment strategy described in this annual report on form k with an aggregate purchase price including the amount of any outstanding indebtedness assumed or incurred by us at least equal to the net proceeds from our initial public offering after deducting the full underwriting discount and other estimated offering expenses payable by us  at which time  we have agreed to pay the underwriters the remainder of the underwriting discount 

table of contents subsequent to december   we entered into one contract with a third party seller to acquire one industrial property consisting of one building located in the washington dc baltimore market 
the property aggregates approximately  square feet for a purchase price of approximately million 
there is no assurance that we will acquire the property under contract because the proposed acquisition is subject to a variety of factors  including the satisfaction of customary closing conditions 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations due by period as of december  dollars in thousands less than more than contractual obligations year years years years total debt debt interest payments purchase obligations deferred underwriting fee total non gaap financial measures we use the following non gaap financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a key measure of our operating performance funds from operations  or ffo 
ffo should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with gaap 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  which defines ffo as net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures which are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we believe that presenting ffo provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance because it is a measure of our operations without regard to specified non cash items  such as real estate depreciation and amortization and gain or loss on sale of assets 
the following table reflects the calculation of ffo reconciled from net loss available to common stockholders for the three months ended december  and the period from february  commencement of operations to december  period from february  for the three commencement of months ended operations to december  december  net loss available to common stockholders depreciation and amortization total depreciation and amortization non real estate depreciation allocation to participating securities funds from operations basic and diluted ffo per common share weighted average basic and diluted common shares to be consistent with our policies of determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities and accounting for earnings per share  the ffo per common share is adjusted for ffo distributed through declared dividends if any and allocated to all participating securities weighted average common shares outstanding and unvested restricted shares outstanding under the two class method

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
in pursuing our business strategies  the primary market risk which we may be exposed to in the future is interest rate risk 
we may be exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of debt used to maintain liquidity  fund capital expenditures and expand our investment portfolio and operations 
we seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
we expect that some of our future outstanding debt will have variable interest rates 
we may use interest rate caps to manage our interest rate risks relating to our variable rate debt 
we expect to replace variable rate debt on a regular basis with fixed rate  long term debt to finance our assets and operations
