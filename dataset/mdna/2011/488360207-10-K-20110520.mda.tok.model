item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results  cash flows  and financial condition for the three fiscal years ended march  the discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to  the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
except for the historical information contained herein  the discussions in this document contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual future results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed under the item a  risk factors and  from time to time  in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
business overview we are a leading global manufacturer of a wide variety of capacitors 
our product offerings include tantalum  multilayer ceramic  solid and electrolytic aluminum and film and paper capacitors 
capacitors are fundamental components of most electronic circuits and are found in communication systems  data processing equipment  personal computers  cellular phones  automotive electronic systems  defense and aerospace systems  consumer electronics  power management systems and many other electronic devices and systems

on november   our shareholders approved a reverse stock split of our common stock at a ratio of for the reverse stock split became effective november   pursuant to a certificate of amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation filed with the secretary of state of delaware 
we had million shares of common stock issued and outstanding immediately following the completion of the reverse stock split 
we are authorized in the restated certificate of incorporation to issue up to a total of million shares of common stock at a par value per share  which was unchanged by the amendment 
the reverse stock split did not affect the registration of the common stock under the exchange act or the listing of the common stock  under the symbol kem  although the post split shares have a new listing with a new cusip number 
in the consolidated balance sheets  the line item stockholders equity has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split for all periods presented by reducing the line item common stock and increasing the line item additional paid in capital  with no change to stockholders equity in the aggregate 
all share and per share computations have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented to reflect the decrease in shares as a result of this transaction except as otherwise noted 
on december   in connection with a secondary offering in which k equity was the selling security holder  k equity sold a portion of the platinum warrant representing the right to purchase million shares of our common stock to the underwriters of the secondary offering  who exercised their full portion of the warrant in a cashless exercise  based on an exercise price of per share and a closing price of  and received a net settlement of million shares of our common stock 
these shares were sold as part of a secondary offering and kemet did not receive any of the proceeds from the transaction 
k equity retained the unsold portion of the warrant  representing the

table of contents outlook looking out to the first quarter of fiscal year  we anticipate an increase in net sales in a range of to when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year this increase is primarily due to film and electrolytic machinery division while we anticipate a slight increase in our component sales 
consolidated gross margin is expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter of fiscal year off balance sheet arrangements other than operating lease commitments  we are not a party to any material off balance sheet financing arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are summarized in note  organization and significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
the following identifies a number of policies which require significant judgments and estimates  or are otherwise deemed critical to our financial statements 
our estimates and assumptions are based on historical data and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
in addition  they affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our judgments are based on our assessment as to the effect certain estimates  assumptions  or future trends or events may have on the financial condition and results of operations reported in the consolidated financial statements 
readers should understand that actual future results could differ from these estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
a quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available  can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors 
the amounts used to assess sensitivity ie    etc 
are included to allow readers of this annual report on form k to understand a general cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent our predictions of variability 
for all of these estimates  it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and estimates require regular review and adjustment 
we believe the following critical accounting policies contain the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue only when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
a portion of sales consists of products designed to meet customer specific requirements 
these products typically have stricter tolerances making them useful to the specific customer requesting the product and to customers with similar or less stringent requirements 
products with customer specific requirements are tested and approved by the customer before we mass produce and ship the products 
we recognize revenue at shipment as the sales terms for products produced with customer specific requirements do not contain a final customer acceptance provision or other provisions that are unique and would otherwise allow the customer different acceptance rights 

table of contents a portion of sales is made to distributors under agreements allowing certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by distributors 
our distributor policy includes inventory price protection and ship from stock and debit sfsd programs common in the industry 
the price protection policy protects the value of the distributors inventory in the event we reduce our published selling price to distributors 
this program allows the distributor to debit us for the difference between our list price and the lower authorized price for specific parts 
we establish price protection reserves on specific parts residing in distributors inventories in the period that the price protection is formally authorized by kemet 
the sfsd program provides a mechanism for the distributor to meet a competitive price after obtaining authorization from the local company sales office 
this program allows the distributor to ship its higher priced inventory and debit us for the difference between our list price and the lower authorized price for that specific transaction 
we establish reserves for our sfsd program based primarily on historical sfsd activity and certain distributors actual inventory levels comprising approximately of the total global distributor inventory related to customers which participate in the sfsd program 
estimates are evaluated on a quarterly basis 
if these estimates were changed by in fiscal year  net sales would be impacted by million 
the establishment of these reserves is recognized as a component of the line item net sales on the consolidated statements of operations  while the associated reserves are included in the line item accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out method and market based upon net realizable value 
the valuation of inventories requires us to make estimates 
we also must assess the prices at which we believe the finished goods inventory can be sold compared to its cost 
a sharp decrease in demand could adversely impact earnings as the reserve estimates could increase 
pension and post retirement benefits 
our management  with the assistance of actuarial firms  performs actuarial valuations of the fair values of our pension and post retirement plans benefit obligations 
we make certain assumptions that have a significant effect on the calculated fair value of the obligations such as the weighted average discount rate used to arrive at the net present value of the obligation  salary increases used to calculate the impact future pay increases will have on post retirement obligations  and medical cost inflation used to calculate the impact future medical costs will have on post retirement obligations 
we understand that these assumptions directly impact the actuarial valuation of the obligations recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and the income or expense that flows through the consolidated statements of operations 
we base our assumptions on either historical or market data that we consider reasonable 
variations in these assumptions could have a significant effect on the amounts reported in consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of operations 
the most critical assumption relates to the discount rate 
a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would result in changes to the projected benefit obligation of million and million  respectively 
asset impairment goodwill and long lived assets 
goodwill  which represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired  and intangible 
table of contents assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but are tested for impairment at least on an annual basis 
we perform our impairment test during the first quarter of each fiscal year and when otherwise warranted 
we evaluate our goodwill on a reporting unit basis 
this requires us to estimate the fair value of the reporting units based on the future net cash flows expected to be generated 
the impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit  with the corresponding carrying amounts 
if the reporting unit carrying amount exceeds its fair value  then an indication exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill being measured exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the sum of the amounts assigned to identified net assets 
as a result  the implied fair value of goodwill is generally the residual amount that results from subtracting the value of net assets including all tangible assets and identified intangible assets from the fair value of the reporting unit fair value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using an income based  discounted cash flow dcf analysis  and market based approaches guideline publicly traded company method and guideline transaction method which examine transactions in the marketplace involving the sale of the stocks of similar publicly owned companies  or the sale of entire companies engaged in operations similar to kemet 
in addition to the above described reporting unit valuation techniques  our goodwill impairment assessment also considers our aggregate fair value based upon the value of our outstanding shares of common stock 
long lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
a long lived asset classified as held for sale is initially measured and reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are classified as held and used until the long lived asset is disposed of 
tests for the recoverability of a long lived asset to be held and used are performed by comparing the carrying amount of the long lived asset to the sum of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows  we use future projections of cash flows directly associated with  and which are expected to arise as a direct result of  the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
these assumptions include  among other estimates  periods of operation and projections of sales and cost of sales 
changes in any of these estimates could have a material effect on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if it is determined that the book value of a long lived asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss would be calculated equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its fair value 
the fair value is calculated as the discounted cash flows of the underlying assets 
we perform impairment tests on our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life during the first quarter of each fiscal year and when otherwise warranted 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we completed our impairment test on our intangible assets with indefinite useful life and concluded that no further impairment existed 
a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate used in the valuation would have resulted in changes in the fair value of million and million  respectively 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we hired an independent appraisal firm to test goodwill for impairment 
we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million based on the annual impairment test  which represented all of the ceramic goodwill balance and million of the film and electrolytic goodwill balance 
also occurring in the first quarter 
table of contents of fiscal year  and in part as a result of the goodwill impairment testing  we hired an independent appraisal firm to test the long lived assets of ceramic for impairment 
as a result of this testing  ceramic recorded a million impairment charge to write off all of its other intangible assets and recorded a million impairment charge to write down long lived assets 
we hired an independent appraisal firm to test goodwill and our long lived assets groups for impairment as of september  these impairment tests resulted in a second quarter goodwill impairment charge of million to write off all of the remaining goodwill of film and electrolytic and tantalum 
utilizing an independent appraisal firm  we also completed long lived asset impairment tests in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year and concluded that no further impairment existed 
the goodwill impairment and long lived asset charge to earnings were non cash in nature 
the goodwill and long lived asset impairment reviews are highly subjective and involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions in order to calculate the impairment charges 
estimates of business enterprise fair value use discounted cash flow and other fair value appraisal models and involve making assumptions for future sales trends  market conditions  growth rates  cost reduction initiatives and cash flows for the next several years 
future changes in assumptions may negatively impact future valuations 
in future tests for recoverability  adverse changes in undiscounted cash flow assumptions could result in an impairment of certain long lived assets that would require a non cash charge to the consolidated statements of operations and may have a material effect on our financial condition and operating results 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates 
valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we believe that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets in various jurisdictions will not be realized  based on the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the recent history of cumulative losses  and the insufficient evidence of projected future taxable income to overcome the loss history 
we have provided a valuation allowance related to any benefits from income taxes resulting from the application of a statutory tax rate to the deferred tax assets 
we continue to have net deferred tax assets future tax benefits in several jurisdictions which we expect to realize assuming  based on certain estimates and assumptions  sufficient taxable income can be generated to utilize these deferred tax benefits 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to reduce the value of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional tax expense 
the accounting rules require that we recognize in our financial statements  the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
any accruals for estimated interest and penalties would be recorded as a component of income tax expense 
to the extent that the provision for income taxes changed by of income before income taxes  consolidated net income would change by million in fiscal year 
table of contents results of operations historically  revenues and earnings may or may not be representative of future operating results due to various economic and other factors 
the following table sets forth the consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated amounts in thousands fiscal years ended march  net sales operating costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses research and development restructuring charges goodwill impairment write down of long lived assets net gain on sales and disposals of assets curtailment gains on benefit plans operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year overview net sales net sales for fiscal year were  million  which represents a increase from fiscal year net sales of million 
tantalum  ceramic and film and electrolytic sales increased by million  million and million  respectively 
unit sales volume for fiscal year increased as compared to fiscal year unit sales volume and revenue were positively affected by the global economic recovery which resulted in an increase in demand for capacitors 
average selling prices increased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to a positive region mix shift to the americas and emea and we increased prices to offset the increase in raw material prices 
improving economic conditions led to higher sales in the first three quarters of fiscal year net sales for the first quarter of fiscal year improved to million  a increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and our net sales improved to million in the second quarter of fiscal year  a increase compared to first fiscal quarter of fiscal year similarly  our net sales further improved to million in the third quarter of fiscal year  a increase compared to the second quarter of fiscal year the fourth quarter of fiscal year showed a decrease in our net sales to million compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 
table of contents in fiscal year and  net sales by region were as follows dollars in millions fiscal year fiscal year net sales of total net sales of total americas americas apac apac emea emea in fiscal year and  net sales by channel were as follows fiscal year fiscal year distributors ems oem gross margin gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  increased to of net sales from of net sales in the prior fiscal year 
several factors contributed to the increase in gross margin percentage in fiscal year the primary contributor to the higher gross margin was the increase in unit sales volume and overall average selling prices 
during the remainder of this restructuring effort  we expect to spend between million to million  primarily in our film and electrolytic business group 
we expect our restructuring plan to result in a reduction in our european operating cost structure of approximately million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year we anticipate that benefits from the restructuring efforts will continue to grow during fiscal years and during fiscal year  we expect to realize the full potential of the restructuring plan  achieving total annualized operational cost reductions of approximately million versus fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a expenses were million  or of net sales for fiscal year compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal year the million increase in sg a expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year includes the following increases million in selling expenses consistent with the increase in sales  million related to incentive accruals  million related to marketing expenses  million related to erp integration costs and million in debt and stock registration related fees in fiscal year compared to fiscal year these higher expenses were offset by a decrease in expenses associated with the cancellation of an incentive plan of million which was incurred in the second quarter of fiscal year and a million decrease in depreciation in fiscal year compared to fiscal year restructuring charges during fiscal year  we incurred million in restructuring charges compared to million in restructuring charges in fiscal year the restructuring charges in fiscal year included million in charges for the relocation of equipment to mexico and china as well as relocation of the european distribution center  and million for reductions in workforce 
the million in personnel reduction costs related to the following headcount reductions in italy  million  the closure of our nantong  china plant expected to be completed in the second quarter of fiscal year  million  and million related to the company initiative to reduce overhead within the company as a whole and headcount reductions in mexico 
these personnel reduction charges were 
table of contents offset by a million reversal of prior expenses primarily associated with the cassia integrazione guadagni straordinaria cigs plan as it was determined that only employees are expected to participate in the program through october the agreements with the labor unions allowed the company to place up to workers  on a rotation basis  on the cigs plan to save labor costs 
cigs is a temporary plan to save labor costs whereby a company may temporarily lay off employees while the government continues to pay their wages for a maximum of months for the program 
the employees who are in cigs are not working  but are still employed by the company 
only employees that are not classified as management or executive level personnel can participate in the cigs program 
upon termination of the plan  the affected employees return to work 
during fiscal year  we recognized charges of million for reductions in workforce primarily associated with a headcount reduction of employees in portugal  a headcount reduction of employees in finland  and a headcount reduction of employees in italy 
there were also headcount reductions at the executive level related to our initiative to reduce overhead within the company as a whole 
in addition to the headcount reduction in portugal  management incurred charges related to the relocation of equipment from portugal to mexico 
machinery not used for production in portugal and not relocated to mexico was disposed of and as such the company recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the equipment to scrap value 
overall  we incurred charges of million related to the relocation of equipment to mexico from portugal and various other locations 
the restructuring plan includes implementing programs to make the company more competitive  removing excess capacity  moving production to lower cost locations  and eliminating unnecessary costs throughout the company 
research and development research and development expenses were million  or of net sales for fiscal year  compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal year the increase resulted from increased activities to ensure that products are available to support kemet growth and to meet customers needs 
the growth in spending also reflects kemet increased focus on specialty product development which requires an increase in sampling  tooling  and testing 
operating income operating income for fiscal year was million compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
increased average selling prices and volume led to a gross margin increase of million in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year additionally  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  restructuring charges were million lower  gain on disposal of assets improved million and write down of long lived assets improved million 
these favorable items were offset by a million increase in operating expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year other income expense  net other income expense  net was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  a decrease of million 
the improvement is primarily attributable to the platinum warrant no longer being marked to market in fiscal year compared to a non cash million charge related to the increase in value of the platinum warrant in fiscal year in addition  we granted a supplier of tantalum powder and wire and related materials  a non exclusive license  with a right to sublicense  concerning certain patents and patent applications which resulted in a net gain of million in fiscal year also  there was a gain on foreign currency translation of million in fiscal year as compared to a million loss on foreign currency translation in fiscal year  primarily due to the change in the value of the euro compared to the dollar 
these items were offset by a million non cash loss recognized on the early extinguishment of debt in fiscal year compared to a million non cash gain recognized on the early extinguishment of debt in fiscal year 
table of contents also offsetting the favorable items was a million increase in net interest expense in fiscal year compared with fiscal year primarily related to the restructuring of our debt to the senior notes

our increase in average selling prices was partially attributed to our effort to expand into alternative and energy saving products 
gross margin gross margin increased million during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase was due to both improved average selling prices across all regions and product lines and increased unit sales volume 
the manufacturing restructuring plan is ongoing with benefits expected beginning in fiscal year operating income loss operating income was million in fiscal year  compared to a million operating loss in fiscal year the improvement in operating income of million was attributable primarily to the million improvement in gross margin as well as the million decrease in restructuring charges

comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year overview net sales net sales for fiscal year were million  which represented an decrease from fiscal year net sales of million 
film and electrolytic sales decreased million while tantalum and ceramic sales decreased by million and million  respectively 
unit sales volume for fiscal year decreased as compared to fiscal year unit sales volume and revenue were negatively affected by the global economic downturn that adversely impacted all regions as well as the weak automotive market  a decline in the dc film product line due to lower demand in the consumer  lighting  and automotive industries and a softening in the high capacitance value hi cv market in asia 
average selling prices increased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to a positive product mix shift to polymer products for tantalum 
this increase was partially offset by an unfavorable product mix shift in film and electrolytic as our most significant sales decrease occurred with industrial customers who purchase our highest technology products that typically have the highest average selling price 
improving economic conditions led to higher sales in each of the quarters following the fourth quarter of fiscal year when the impact of the economic downturn had its most adverse affect on our sales and net sales declined to million 
net sales for the first quarter of fiscal year improved to million  a increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and our net sales improved to million

gross margin gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  increased to of net sales from of net sales in the prior year 
several factors contributed to the increase in gross margin percentage in fiscal year cost savings from several cost reduction plans that were initiated throughout fiscal year were partially responsible for the improvement 
in fiscal year  we incurred costs in conjunction with the relocation and start up of equipment in china and a million lower of cost or market charge to adjust ceramic hi cv inventory to its net realizable value 
in addition  there was an overall increase in average selling prices which contributed to the increase in gross margin 
these improvements were offset by the negative gross margin in film and electrolytic 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses were million  or of net sales for fiscal year compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal year the million decrease in sg a expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year includes a decrease of million in selling expenses primarily attributable to cost reductions resulting from our reduction in workforce  a wage reduction for all salaried employees effective january  where possible and the temporary suspension of the match in our us defined contribution retirement plan  reducing it from to

effective october   we also retracted our wage reduction in the us in addition  during fiscal year  costs related to integrating our acquisitions were million lower  bad debt expense was million lower and pension charges were million lower 
in addition  we reduced redundant administrative expenses primarily within film and electrolytic and reduced legal expenses 
the reduction in these costs was offset by an increase of million related to incentive accruals  information systems  and depreciation 
restructuring charges during fiscal year  we recognized charges of million for reductions in workforce primarily associated with a headcount reduction of employees in portugal  a headcount reduction of employees in finland  and a headcount reduction of employees in italy

table of contents charges of million related to the relocation of equipment to mexico from portugal and various other locations 
the restructuring plan includes implementing programs to make the company more competitive  removing excess capacity  moving production to lower cost locations  and eliminating unnecessary costs throughout the company 
during fiscal year  we recognized charges of million for reductions in workforce worldwide related to three cost reduction plans 
we recognized charges of million primarily for reductions in workforce in film and electrolytic 
we recognized charges of million related primarily to the reduction of approximately  manufacturing positions representing approximately of our workforce 
we recognized charges of million related to the rationalization of corporate staff and manufacturing support functions in the us  europe  mexico  and asia 
approximately employees were affected by this action 
additionally  during fiscal year  we incurred expenses of million for the relocation of equipment 
goodwill impairment and write down of long lived assets we tested goodwill for impairment during the first and second quarters of fiscal year due to reduced earnings and cash flows caused by macro economic factors  excess capacity issues and delays in integrating recently acquired businesses  we reduced our earnings forecast in conjunction with such testing 
as a result  our impairment testing for fiscal year led to a million non cash goodwill impairment charge to write off all of the carrying value of our goodwill 
we determined the business enterprise fair value by using both an income approach and a market approach 
film and electrolytic recorded a million impairment charge  tantalum recorded a million impairment charge  and ceramic recorded a million impairment charge 
in addition  and partially as a result of the goodwill impairment testing  ceramic recorded a million impairment charge to write off all of its other intangible assets and recorded a million impairment charge to write down its long lived assets

reflects the expected benefit payments through non gaap financial measures to complement our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows  we use non gaap financial measures of adjusted operating income loss  adjusted net income loss and adjusted ebitda 
we believe that adjusted operating income loss  adjusted net income loss and adjusted ebitda are complements to us gaap amounts and such measures are useful to investors 
the presentation of these non gaap measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance  or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity

adjusted operating income loss represents operating income loss  excluding adjustments which are outlined in the quantitative reconciliation provided above 
we use adjusted operating income loss to facilitate our analysis and understanding of our business operations and believe that adjusted operating income loss is useful to investors because it provides a supplemental way to understand the underlying operating performance of the company 
adjusted operating income loss should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with us gaap 
adjusted net income loss represents net loss  excluding adjustments which are more specifically outlined in the quantitative reconciliation provided above 
we use adjusted net loss to evaluate the company operating performance and believe that adjusted net loss is useful to investors because it provides a supplemental way to understand the underlying operating performance of the company 
adjusted net loss should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with us gaap 
adjusted ebitda represents net income loss before income tax expense  interest expense  net  and depreciation and amortization  adjusted to exclude restructuring charges  debt and stock registration related fees  erp integration costs  gain on licensing of patents  write down of long lived assets  stock based compensation expense  increase in value of warrant  curtailment gains on benefit plans  gain on sales and disposals of assets  gain loss on the early extinguishment of debt  net foreign exchange gain loss  inventory write downs and acquisitions integration costs 
we present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance and ability to service debt 
we also present 
table of contents adjusted ebitda because we believe such measure is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry 
we believe adjusted ebitda is an appropriate supplemental measure of debt service capacity because cash expenditures on interest are  by definition  available to pay interest  and tax expense is inversely correlated to interest expense because tax expense goes down as deductible interest expense goes up  depreciation and amortization are non cash charges 
the other items excluded from adjusted ebitda are excluded in order to better reflect our continuing operations 
in evaluating adjusted ebitda  you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments noted above 
our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these types of adjustments 
adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of our financial performance under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with us gaap or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity 
our adjusted ebitda measure has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under us gaap 
some of these limitations are it does not reflect our cash expenditures  future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  it does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  it does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and our adjusted ebitda measure does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  it is not adjusted for all non cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows  it does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not be indicative of our ongoing operations  it does not reflect limitations on or costs related to transferring earnings from our subsidiaries to us  and other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations 
you should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our us gaap results and using adjusted ebitda only supplementally 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standard update asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
the updated guidance i requires separate disclosure of significant transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements  ii requires disclosure of level fair value measurements activity on a gross basis  iii clarifies existing disaggregation requirements and iv clarifies existing input and valuation 
table of contents technique disclosure requirements 
the updated guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   except for the level fair value measurement disclosure requirements  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of asu no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 business combinations topic  that updates existing disclosure requirements related to supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
under the updated guidance  a public entity that presents comparative financial statements should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the guidance also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
this guidance was effective for us on april   and will be applied prospectively to any business combinations that have an acquisition date on or after april  effect of inflation inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of labor  equipment  and raw materials 
we do not believe that inflation has had any material effect on our business over the past three fiscal years except for the following discussion in commodity price risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk through our other borrowing activities  which had an outstanding balance as of march   of million 
the other debt has a variable interest rate and a change in the interest rate would yield a million change in interest expense 
foreign currency exchange rate risk given our international operations and sales  we are exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates 
of these  the most significant are currently the euro and the mexican peso 
a portion of our sales to our customers and operating costs in europe are denominated in euro creating an exposure to foreign currency exchange rates 
also  a portion of our costs in our mexican operations are denominated in mexican pesos  creating an exposure to foreign currency exchange rates 
additionally  certain of our non us subsidiaries make sales denominated in us dollars which expose them to foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
historically  in order to minimize our exposure  we periodically entered into forward foreign exchange contracts in which the future cash flows were hedged against the us dollar 
the company does not presently have in place any forward foreign exchange contracts  but does periodically evaluate the use of such contracts as a means of hedging its foreign exchange exposure 
commodity price risk the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are tantalum powder  palladium  aluminum and silver 
these materials are considered commodities and are subject to price volatility 
due to market constraints  we no longer purchase tantalum powder under long term contracts 
instead  we forecast our tantalum needs for the short term twelve weeks and make purchases based upon those forecasts  we currently have purchase agreements outstanding for three to six months 
while the financial impact of these decisions are short term in nature given that we are not currently party to any long term supply agreements  they could impact our financial performance from 
table of contents period to period given that we do not hedge any of our raw material exposure and we may be unable to pass on to a significant number of our customers any fluctuations in our raw material costs 
additionally  any delays in obtaining raw materials for our products could hinder our ability to manufacture our products  negatively impacting our competitive position and our relationships with our customers 
presently  a finite number of suppliers process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder 
if there are significant fluctuations in demand  based on leadtime of ore to tantalum smelter  an increase in the price of tantalum may result 
if we are unable to pass the price increase on to our customers  it could have an adverse effect on our profitability 
palladium is a precious metal used in the manufacture of multilayer ceramic capacitors and is mined primarily in russia and south africa 
we continue to pursue ways to reduce palladium usage in ceramic capacitors in order to minimize the price risk 
the amount of palladium that we require has generally been available in sufficient quantities  however the price of palladium is driven by the market which has shown significant price fluctuations 
for instance  in fiscal year the price of palladium fluctuated between and per troy ounce 
price increases and the possibility of our inability to pass such increases on to our customers could have an adverse effect on profitability 
silver and aluminum have generally been available in sufficient quantities  and we believe there are a sufficient number of suppliers from which we can purchase our requirements 
an increase in the price of silver and aluminum that we are unable to pass on to our customers  however  could have an adverse effect on our profitability
