item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview otter tail corporation and its subsidiaries form a diverse group of businesses with operations classified into seven segments electric  wind energy  manufacturing  construction  plastics  health services and food ingredient processing 
our primary financial goals are to maximize earnings and cash flows and to allocate capital profitably toward growth opportunities that will increase shareholder value 
meeting these objectives enables us to preserve and enhance our financial capability by maintaining desired capitalization ratios and a strong interest coverage position and preserving investment grade credit ratings on outstanding securities  which  in the form of lower interest rates  benefits both our customers and shareholders 
our strategy is to continue to grow our largest business  the regulated electric utility  along with our nonelectric operating companies 
reliable utility performance along with rate base investment opportunities over the next four to seven years will provide a strong base of revenues  earnings and cash flows 
we also look to our nonelectric operating companies to provide organic growth as well 
organic  internal growth comes from new products and services  market expansion and increased efficiencies 
we expect much of our growth in our nonelectric businesses in the next few years will come from utilizing expanded plant capacity from capital investments made in previous years 
we believe that owning well run  profitable companies across different industries will bring more growth opportunities and more balance to our results 
in doing thi s  we also avoid concentrating business risk within a single industry 
all of our operating companies operate under a decentralized business model with disciplined corporate oversight 
we assess the performance of our operating companies over time  using the following criteria ability to provide returns on invested capital that exceed our weighted average cost of capital over the long term  and assessment of an operating company s business and potential for future earnings growth 
we are a committed long term owner and therefore we do not acquire companies in pursuit of short term gains 
however  we may divest operating companies that no longer fit into our strategy and risk profile over the long term 
major growth strategies and initiatives in our company s future include planned capital budget expenditures of up to million for the years through of which million is for capital projects at otter tail power company otp  including million for otp s share of a new air quality control system at big stone plant and million for anticipated expansion of transmission capacity including million for capx transmission projects 
see capital requirements section for further discussion 
utilization of expanded plant capacity from capital investments made in our nonelectric businesses 
the continued investigation and evaluation of organic growth and strategic acquisition opportunities as well as divestiture opportunities which will allow us to raise internal capital to support our future capital expenditure plans and adjust our overall risk profile 
in our net cash from operations was million 
our electric segment net income increased to million 
our plastics segment net income increased million 
our health services segment net income increased million 
our food ingredient processing segment net income increased to a record million 
our wind energy segment lost million 
dmi incurred additional costs related to fulfilling the fabrication specifications for a customer s new wind tower design 
these efforts resulted in lower productivity and higher costs as they involved a combination of adding staff and reallocating existing resources within dmi to meet the customer s delivery requirements 
actions are being taken to improve production efficiency and to further the critical relationships that dmi continues to build with key wind turbine manufacturers 
our manufacturing segment lost million as a result of a million net of tax asset impairment charge at shoremaster  inc shoremaster  our waterfront equipment manufacturer

north dakota wind energy credits are based on dollars invested in qualifying facilities and are being recognized on a straight line basis over years 
income tax reductions from federal production tax credits and north dakota wind energy credits are passed back to otp s retail electric customers through reductions to renewable resource recovery riders or renewable energy costs recovered in general rates 
impact of inflation otp operates under regulatory provisions that allow price changes in fuel and certain purchased power costs to be passed to most retail customers through automatic adjustments to its rate schedules under fuel clause adjustments 
other increases in the cost of electric service must be recovered through timely filings for electric rate increases with the appropriate regulatory agency 
our wind energy  manufacturing  construction  plastics  health services and food ingredient processing segments consist entirely of businesses whose revenues are not subject to regulation by ratemaking authorities 
increased operating costs are reflected in product or services pricing with any limitations on price increases determined by the marketplace 
raw material costs  labor costs  fuel and energy costs and interest rates are important components of costs for companies in these segments 
any or all of these components could be impacted by inflation or other pricing pressures  with a possible adverse effect on our profitability  especially where increases in these costs exceed price increases on finished products 
in recent years  our operating companies have faced strong inflationary and other pricing pressures with respect to steel  fuel  resin  lumber  concrete  aluminum and health care costs  which have been partially mitigated by pricing adjustments 
liquidity the following table presents the status of our lines of credit as of december  and december  in thousands line limit in use on december  restricted due to outstanding letters of credit available on december  available on december  otter tail corporation credit agreement otp credit agreement total we believe we have the necessary liquidity to effectively conduct business operations for an extended period if needed 
our balance sheet is strong and we are in compliance with our debt covenants 
financial flexibility is provided by operating cash flows  unused lines of credit  strong financial coverages  investment grade credit ratings  and alternative financing arrangements such as leasing 
we believe our financial condition is strong and our cash  other liquid assets  operating cash flows  existing lines of credit  access to capital markets and borrowing ability because of investment grade credit ratings  when taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects 
on may  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission under which we may offer for sale  from time to time  either separately or together in any combination  equity  debt or other securities described in the shelf registration statement 
on march   we entered into a distribution agreement with jp morgan securities jpms under which we may offer and sell our common shares f rom time to time through jpms  as our distribution agent  up to an aggregate sales price of million 
equity or debt financing will be required in the period through given the expansion plans related to our electric segment to fund construction of new rate base investments  in the event we decide to reduce borrowings under our lines of credit or refund or retire early any of our presently outstanding debt or cumulative preferred shares  to complete acquisitions or for other corporate purposes 
also  our operating cash flow and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside our control 
in addition  our borrowing costs can be impacted by changing interest rates on short term and long term debt and ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies  which in part are based on certain credit measures such as interest coverage and leverage ratios 
our dividend payout ratio has exceeded in each of the last three years 
the determination of the amount of future cash dividends to be declared and paid will depend on  among other things  our financial condition  improvement in earnings per share to levels in excess of the indicated annual dividend per share of  cash flows from operations  the level of our capital expenditures  restrictions under our credit facilities and our future business prospects 
the decision to declare a quarterly dividend is reviewed quarterly by the board of directors

critical accounting policies involving significant estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to consolidated financial statements 
the discussion and analysis of the financial statements and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we use estimates based on the best information available in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations 
estimates are used for such items as depreciable lives  asset impairment evaluations  tax provisions  collectability of trade accounts receivable  self insurance programs  unbilled electric revenues  accrued renewable resource and transmission rider revenues  valuations of forward energy contracts  service contract maintenance costs  percentage of completion and actuarially determined benefits costs and liabilities 
as better information becomes available or actual amounts are known  estimates are revised 
operating results can be affected by revised estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the application of these critical a ccounting policies and the development of these estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits obligations and costs pension and postretirement benefit liabilities and expenses for our electric utility and corporate employees are determined by actuaries using assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase and healthcare cost trend rates 
further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions is included in note to consolidated financial statements 
these benefits  for any individual employee  can be earned and related expenses can be recognized and a liability accrued over periods of up to or more years 
these benefits can be paid out for up to or more years after an employee retires 
estimates of liabilities and expenses related to these benefits are among our most critical accounting estimates 
although deferral and amortization of fluctuations in actuarially determined benefit obligations and expenses are provided for when actual results on a year to year basis deviate from long range assumptions  compensation increases and healthcare cost increases or a reduction in the discount rate applied from one year to the next can significantly increase our benefit expenses in the year of the change 
also  a reduction in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets in our fund ed pension plan or realized rates of return on plan assets that are well below assumed rates of return could result in significant increases in recognized pension benefit expenses in the year of the change or for many years thereafter because actuarial losses can be amortized over the average remaining service lives of active employees 
the pension benefit cost for for our noncontributory funded pension plan is expected to be million compared to million in  reflecting a reduction in the assumed rate of return on pension plan assets from in to in the estimated discount rate used to determine annual benefit cost accruals will be in  the same rate as in in selecting the discount rate  we consider the yields of fixed income debt securities  which have ratings of aa published by recognized rating agencies  along with bond matching models specific to our plans as a basis to determine the rate 
subsequent increases or decreases in actual rates of return on plan assets over assumed rates or increases or decreases in the discount rate or rate of increase in future compensation levels could significantly change projected costs 
for  all other factors being held constant a increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased our pension benefit cost by  a increase in the assumed rate of increase in future compensation levels would have increased our pension benefit cost by  a decrease in the assumed rate of increase in future compensation levels would have decreased our pension benefit cost by  a increase or decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased our pension benefit cost by  increases or decreases in the discount rate or in retiree healthcare cost inflation rates could significantly change our projected postretirement healthcare benefit costs 
a increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased our postretirement medical benefit costs by  see note to consolidated financial statements for the cost impact of a change in medical cost inflation rates 
we believe the estimates made for our pension and other postretirement benefits are reasonable based on the information that is known at the point in time the estimates are made 
these estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of variables and are subject to change 
revenue recognition dmi  shoremaster and our construction companies record operating revenues on a percentage of completion basis for fixed price construction contracts 
the method used to determine the progress of completion is based on the ratio of labor hours incurred to total estimated labor hours at dmi  and costs incurred to total estimated costs on all other construction projects 
the duration of the majority of these contracts is less than a year 
revenues recognized on jobs in progress as of december  were million 
any expected losses on jobs in progress at year end have been recognized 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the percentage of completion accounting on uncompleted contracts is critical to the extent that any underestimate of total expected costs on fixed price construction contracts could result in reduced pr ofit margins being recognized on these contracts at the time of completion 
forward energy contracts classified as derivatives otp s forward contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity are derivatives subject to mark to market accounting under generally accepted accounting principles 
the market prices used to value otp s forward contracts for the purchases and sales of electricity and electricity generating capacity are determined by survey of counterparties or brokers used by otp s power services personnel responsible for contract pricing  as well as prices gathered from daily settlement prices published by the intercontinental exchange and cme globex 
for certain contracts  prices at illiquid trading points are based on a basis spread between that trading point and more liquid trading hub prices 
these basis spreads are determined based on available market price information and the use of forward price curve models and  as such  are estimates 
the forward energy sales contracts that are marked to market as of december   are offset by forward energy purchase contracts in terms of volumes and delivery periods but not in terms of delivery points 
the differential in forward prices at the different delivery locations currently results in a net mark to market unrealized gain on otp s open forward contracts 
otp s recognized but unrealized net gains of  on forward purchases and sales of electricity marked to market on december  are expected to be realized on settlement as scheduled over the following periods in the amounts listed in thousands st qtr nd qtr rd qtr th qtr total net gain allowance for doubtful accounts our operating companies encounter risks associated with sales and the collection of the associated accounts receivable 
as such  they record provisions for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  the operating companies primarily utilize historical rates of accounts receivables written off as a percentage of total revenue 
this historical rate is applied to the current revenues on a monthly basis 
the historical rate is updated periodically based on events that may change the rate  such as a significant increase or decrease in collection performance and timing of payments as well as the calculated total exposure in relation to the allowance 
periodically  operating companies compare identified credit risks with allowances that have been established using histori cal experience and adjust allowances accordingly 
in circumstances where an operating company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet financial obligations  the operating company records a specific allowance for bad debts to reduce the account receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
we believe the accounting estimates related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is critical because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital 
during  million of bad debt expense of total revenue of billion was recorded and the allowance for doubtful accounts was million of trade accounts receivable as of december  general economic conditions and specific geographic concerns are major factors that may affect the adequacy of the allowance and may result in a change in the annual bad debt expense 
an increase or decrease in our consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts based on one percentage point of outstanding trade receivables at december  would result in a million increase or decrease in bad debt expense 
although an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts on our operating companies accounts receivable is provided for  the allowance for doubtful accounts on the electric segment s wholesale electric sales is insignificant in proportion to annual revenues from these sales 
the electric segment has not experienced a bad debt related to wholesale electric sales largely due to stringent risk management criteria related to these sales 
nonpayment on a single wholesale electric sale could result in a significant bad debt expense 
depreciation expense and depreciable lives the provisions for depreciation of electric utility property for financial reporting purposes are made on the straight line method based on the estimated service lives to years of the properties 
such provisions as a percent of the average balance of depreciable electric utility property were in  in and in depreciation rates on electric utility property are subject to annual regulatory review and approval  and depreciation expense is recovered through rates set by ratemaking authorities 
although the useful lives of electric utility properties are estimated  the recovery of their cost is dependent on the ratemaking process 
deregulation of the electric industry could result in changes to the estimated useful lives of electric utility property that could impact depreciation expense 
property and equipment of our nonelectric operations are carried at historical cost or at the then current replacement cost if acquired in a business combination accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are depreciated on a straight line basis over useful lives to years of the related assets 
we believe the lives and methods of determining depreciation are reasonable  however  changes in economic conditions affecting the industries in which our nonelectric companies operate or innovations in technology could result in a reduction of the estimated useful lives of our nonelectric operating companies property  plant and equipment or in an impairment write down of the carrying value of these properties 
taxation we are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and our ongoing operations to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities 
these tax obligations include income  real estate and use taxes 
these judgments could result in the recognition of a liability for potential adverse outcomes regarding uncertain tax positions that we have taken 
while we believe our liability for uncertain tax positions as of december  reflects the most likely probable expected outcome of these tax matters in accordance with the requirements of accounting standards codification asc  income taxes  the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in additional adjustments to our consolidated financial statements 
however  we do not belie ve such adjustments would be material 
deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial reporting purposes 
we assess our deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration both our historical and anticipated earnings levels  the reversal of other existing temporary differences  available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
based on this assessment  management must evaluate the need for  and amount of  a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
as facts and circumstances change  adjustments to the valuation allowance may be required 
we have recorded a valuation allowance related to the probability of recovery of our deferred tax assets recorded on foreign net operating lo ss carryforwards 
asset impairment we are required to test for asset impairment relating to property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may exceed its fair value and not be recoverable 
we apply the accounting guidance under asc  property  plant  and equipment subsequent measurement  in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
this standard requires an impairment analysis when indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the standard requires that if the sum of the future expected cash flows from a company s asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying amount  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairm ent is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying amount of the asset 
we believe the accounting estimates related to an asset impairment are critical because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period reflecting changing business cycles and require management to make assumptions about future cash flows over future years and the impact of recognizing an impairment could have a significant effect on operations 
management s assumptions about future cash flows require significant judgment because actual operating levels have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
as of december  an assessment of the carrying amounts of our long lived assets and other intangibles indicated these assets were not impaired 
goodwill impairment goodwill is required to be evaluated annually for impairment  according to asc  goodwill subsequent measurement 
the standard requires a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired 
step one is to test for potential impairment and requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to its book value including goodwill 
if the fair value is higher than the book value  no impairment is recognized 
if the fair value is lower than the book value  a second step must be performed 
the second step is to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any  and requires that a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
this fair value is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwil l 
if the implied fair value is lower than the carrying amount  an impairment adjustment must be recorded 
we believe accounting estimates related to goodwill impairment are critical because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
management s assumptions about inflation rates and other internal and external economic conditions  such as earnings growth rate  require significant judgment based on fluctuating rates and expected revenues 
additionally  asc requires goodwill be analyzed for impairment on an annual basis using the assumptions that apply at the time the analysis is updated 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and as conditions warrant 
in  goodwill impairments were recorded at shoremaster and otesco 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for details 
an assessment of the carrying amounts of our remaining goodwill as of december  indicated the fair values of our remaining reporting units are substantially in excess of their respective book values and not impaired 
acquisition method of accounting we account for acquisitions under the requirements of asc  business combinations 
under asc the term purchase method of accounting is replaced with acquisition method of accounting and requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions 
acquired assets and liabilities assumed that are subject to critical estimates include property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 
the fair value of property  plant and equipment is based on valuations performed by qualified internal personnel and or with the assistance of outside appraisers 
fair values assigned to plant and equipment are based on several factors including the age and condition of the equipment  maintenance records of the equipment and auction values for equipment with similar characteristics at the time of purchase 
intangible assets are identified and valued using the guidelines of asc the fair value of intangible assets is based on estimates including royalty rates  customer attrition rates and estimated cash flows 
while the allocation of purchase price is subject to a high degree of judgment and uncertainty  we do not expect the estimates to vary significantly once an acquisition is complete 
we believe our estimates have been reasonable in the past as there have been no significant valuation adjustments to the allocation of purchase price

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december  we had exposure to market risk associated with interest rates because we had million in short term debt outstanding subject to variable interest rates that are indexed to libor plus under our million revolving credit facility and million in short term debt outstanding subject to variable interest rates that are indexed to libor plus under otp s million revolving credit facility 
at december  we had exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
dmi has market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates at its plant in ft 
erie  ontario because the plant pays its operating expenses in canadian dollars 
outstanding trade accounts receivable of the canadian operations of iph are not at risk of valuation change due to changes in foreign currency exchan ge rates because the canadian company transacts all sales in us dollars 
however  iph does have market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates because approximately of iph sales in were outside the united states and the canadian operation of iph pays its operating expenses in canadian dollars 
the majority of our consolidated long term debt has fixed interest rates 
the interest rate on variable rate long term debt is reset on a periodic basis reflecting current market conditions 
we manage our interest rate risk through the issuance of fixed rate debt with varying maturities  through economic refunding of debt through optional refundings  limiting the amount of variable interest rate debt  and the utilization of short term borrowings to allow flexibility in the timing and placement of long term debt 
as of december  we had million of long term debt subject to variable interest rates 
assuming no change in our financial structure  if variable interest rates were to average one percentage point higher or lower than the average variable rate on december   annualized interest expense and pre tax earnings woul d change by approximately  we have not used interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings 
we maintain a ratio of fixed rate debt to total debt within a certain range 
it is our policy to enter into interest rate transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet our stated objectives 
we do not enter into interest rate transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
dmi and the companies in our manufacturing segment are exposed to market risk related to changes in commodity prices for steel  lumber  aluminum  cement and resin 
the price and availability of these raw materials could affect the revenues and earnings of our wind energy and manufacturing segments
