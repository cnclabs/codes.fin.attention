the company we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the rapid development of novel small molecule drugs to treat serious diseases for which there are limited treatment options 
our product candidates in clinical development are mdv  which is in phase development for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer  and dimebon latrepirdine  which is in phase development for the treatment of alzheimer s disease and huntington disease 
our mdv program is partnered with astellas pharma inc  or astellas  and our dimebon program is partnered with pfizer inc  or pfizer 
in october  we entered into a collaboration agreement with astellas 
under the terms of the agreement  we and astellas agreed to develop and commercialize mdv for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer 
we and astellas share equally the costs and expenses of developing and commercializing mdv for the united states market  except that development costs for studies useful in both the united states market and either europe or japan are shared two thirds by astellas and one third by us 
we and astellas will share equally profits or losses resulting from commercialization of mdv in the united states 
outside the united states  astellas will bear all development and commercialization costs  and will pay us tiered double digit royalties on aggregate net sales of mdv in september  we announced a collaboration agreement with pfizer  which became effective in october under the terms of the agreement  we and pfizer agreed to develop and commercialize dimebon for the treatment of alzheimer s disease and huntington disease 
we and pfizer share the costs and expenses of developing and commercializing dimebon for the united states market on a pfizer medivation basis  and will share profits or losses resulting from commercialization of dimebon in the united states in the same proportions 
outside the united states  pfizer will bear all development and commercialization costs  and will pay us tiered royalties on aggregate net sales of dimebon 
in march  we and pfizer reported negative results from the connection study  a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  six month phase study of dimebon in patients with mild to moderate 
table of contents alzheimer s disease 
in the connection trial  dimebon failed to show a statistically significant improvement over placebo on any of the primary or secondary efficacy endpoints  and thus did not meet any of the study s efficacy endpoints 
given the negative results in the connection trial  pfizer has the right to terminate the collaboration agreement with us at any time 
in response to the negative connection data  we implemented a restructuring in march in which we eliminated full time positions and vacated approximately  square feet of office space 
terminated individuals were eligible for a package consisting of a severance payment  continuing medical coverage and outplacement services 
aggregate restructuring charges  all of which were recorded in the period ended march   were million  of which million was classified as selling  general and administrative expense and million was classified as research and development expense 
we have funded our operations primarily through private and public offerings of our common stock  and from the up front  development milestone and cost sharing payments from our collaboration agreements with astellas and pfizer 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and we expect to incur substantial additional losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to finance clinical and preclinical studies of our existing and potential future product candidates and our corporate overhead costs 
our pipeline mdv with astellas  we are currently conducting two randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  multinational phase trials of mdv our phase affirm trial is evaluating mdv in  patients with advanced prostate cancer who have previously failed docetaxel based chemotherapy 
we completed enrollment of the affirm trial in november  and expect to report top line results in  although we may report top line results in if an interim analysis is conducted 
our phase prevail trial is studying mdv in approximately  patients with advanced prostate cancer who have not previously been treated with chemotherapy 
we began enrollment in the prevail trial in september we received a million milestone payment from our partner astellas for initiation of this trial  million of which we paid to ucla pursuant to our mdv license agreement 
we and our partner astellas also expect to initiate two new phase trials in earlier stage prostate cancer populations in the first half of a head to head study of mdv against bicalutamide  the leading marketed anti androgen drug  in advanced prostate cancer patients who have progressed despite treatment with an lhrh analog drug or following surgical castration  and a monotherapy study of mdv in advanced prostate cancer patients who have not yet been treated with any hormonal therapy 
in february  we presented long term follow up data from our ongoing phase clinical trial of mdv at the american society of clinical oncology s genitourinary cancers symposium 
a total of advanced prostate cancer patients  including both men who had failed prior chemotherapy and men who were chemotherapy na ve  were enrolled in this trial between july and december of those men  remained on study as of the cutoff date of the analysis december  
in this trial mdv consistently demonstrated anti tumor activity across endpoints  as evaluated by reductions in prostate specific antigen  or psa  levels  radiographic findings  circulating tumor cell  or ctc  counts  and median times to psa and radiographic progression 
earlier results from this trial were published in in the lancet 
dimebon latrepirdine with pfizer  we are currently conducting two randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  multinational phase trials of dimebon 
our phase horizon trial is studying dimebon in patients with huntington disease over a six month treatment period 
we completed patient dosing in the horizon trial in february  and expect to report top line results in the first half of our phase concert trial is studying dimebon plus donepezil  the leading marketed alzheimer s disease therapy  versus donepezil alone in  patients with mild to moderate alzheimer s disease over a twelve month treatment period 
we completed enrollment in the concert trial in november  and expect to report top line results in the first half of 
table of contents in march  we reported top line results from our connection trial  a randomized  double blind  six month  placebo controlled phase trial in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer s disease in the united states  western europe  russia and chile  and from a separate patient safety study of dimebon in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer s disease in the united states and canada  approximately of whom were also taking one or more approved alzheimer s disease medicines 
in the connection trial  dimebon failed to show a statistically significant improvement over placebo on any of the primary or secondary efficacy endpoints  and thus did not meet any of the study endpoints 
dimebon was well tolerated in both the connection trial and in the patient safety study 
we designed the connection trial to confirm the results of our first clinical trial of dimebon in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer s disease in russia  or the russian study  which was published in in the lancet 
in the russian study  dimebon showed a statistically significant improvement over placebo on all of the same primary and secondary efficacy endpoints used in the connection trial 
thus  the connection trial failed to replicate the efficacy results seen in the russian study 
in july  we announced top line results of a patient phase study showing that dimebon was well tolerated and significantly improved cognitive function in huntington disease patients compared to those treated with a placebo 
the three month study  which was conducted in the us and the united kingdom  met its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability  in addition  dimebon showed statistically significant benefit versus placebo in cognition as measured by the mini mental state examination  or mmse  a secondary endpoint in the study 
however  dimebon failed to show a statistically significant benefit over placebo in this study on two other cognitive endpoints the cognitive component of the unified huntington disease rating scale  or uhdrs  and the alzheimer s disease assessment scale cognitive subscale  or adas cog 
results of this study were published in march in archives of neurology 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or us gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies and significant estimates and judgments underlying our financial statements are as follows estimated performance periods under our collaboration agreements both our astellas and pfizer collaboration agreements contain multiple elements and deliverables  and required evaluation pursuant to accounting standards codification  or asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements asc 
we evaluated the facts and circumstances of the collaboration agreements to determine whether we had obligations constituting deliverables under asc we concluded that we had multiple deliverables under both the astellas and pfizer collaboration agreements  including deliverables relating to grants of technology licenses  and performance of manufacturing  regulatory and clinical development activities in the us in the case of the astellas collaboration agreement  the period in which we perform our deliverables began in the fourth quarter of and management presently estimates that it will be completed in the fourth quarter of in the case of the pfizer collaboration agreement  the period in which we perform our deliverables began in the fourth quarter of and management presently estimates that it will be completed in the fourth quarter of we also concluded that our deliverables under each collaboration agreement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting under asc estimation of the performance periods of our deliverables requires the use of our management s judgment 
significant factors considered in management s evaluation of the estimated performance period include  but are 
table of contents not limited to  our experience  along with astellas and pfizer s experience  in conducting clinical development and regulatory activities 
we review the estimated duration of our performance periods under both collaborations on a quarterly basis and make any appropriate adjustments on a prospective basis 
during the year ended december   we extended the estimated completion date of our performance period under the pfizer collaboration agreement from the second quarter of to the fourth quarter of  based on the failure of the connection study and the resulting longer period required to complete the clinical trials evaluating dimebon s potential safety and efficacy as a treatment for mild to moderate alzheimer s disease 
future changes in estimates of either of our performance periods may materially impact the timing of future revenue recognized under the applicable collaboration agreement 
collaboration agreement payments 
we account for the various payment flows under our collaboration agreements in a consistent manner  as follows up front payments 
we received non refundable up front payments of million and million under our collaboration agreements with astellas and pfizer  respectively 
we recognize these payments as revenue on a straight line basis over the applicable estimated performance period 
milestone payments 
under both the astellas and pfizer collaboration agreements  we are eligible to receive milestone payments based on achievement of specified development  regulatory and commercial events 
management evaluated the nature of the events triggering these contingent payments  and concluded that these events except for a those relating to regulatory activities in europe  development and regulatory activities in japan  and commercial activities  all of which are areas in which we have no pertinent contractual responsibilities  and b the initiation of our phase prevail trial under the astellas collaboration agreement  an event which management deemed to be reasonably assured at the inception of the astellas collaboration constituted substantive milestones 
this conclusion was based primarily on the facts that i each triggering event represents a specific outcome that can be achieved only through successful performance by us of one or more of our deliverables  ii achievement of each triggering event was subject to inherent risk and uncertainty and would result in additional payments becoming due to us  iii each of these milestones was substantive  based primarily on the facts that the payments they trigger are non refundable  iv achievement of the milestone entails risk and was not reasonably assured at inception of the collaboration agreement  v substantial effort is required to complete each milestone  vi the amount of each milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the value created in achieving the milestone  vii a substantial amount of time is expected to pass between the up front payment and the potential milestone payments  and viii the milestone payments relate solely to past performance 
based on the foregoing  we will recognize any revenue from these milestone payments under the substantive milestone method in the period in which the underlying triggering event occurs 
for the contingent payments triggered by events that do not constitute substantive milestones  management concluded that the appropriate revenue recognition treatment depends on whether the triggering event occurs during or after the performance period of the applicable collaboration agreement 
where the triggering event occurs during the applicable performance period  we will amortize any revenue from this event on a straight line basis over the applicable performance period 
where the triggering event occurs after the applicable performance period  we will recognize the associated revenue in the period in which the event occurs 
royalties and profit sharing payments 
under both the astellas and pfizer collaboration agreements  we are eligible to receive profit sharing payments on sales of products in the us and royalties on sales of products outside the us we will recognize any revenue from these events based on the revenue recognition criteria set forth in asc  revenue recognition 
based on those criteria  we consider these potential payments to be contingent revenues  and will recognize them as revenue in the period in which the applicable contingency is resolved 

table of contents cost sharing true up payments 
under both the astellas and pfizer collaboration agreements  we and our partners share certain development and commercialization costs in the us the parties make quarterly true up payments between themselves to ensure that each has borne its applicable percentage of the shared development and commercialization costs 
our policy is to account for cost sharing true up payments receivable by us as reductions in expense  and to account for cost sharing true up payments payable by us as increases in expense 
stock based compensation we apply asc  compensation stock compensation asc  which requires the measurement and recognition of non cash compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including stock options and restricted stock units awarded under our amended and restated equity incentive award plan  based on estimated fair values 
we have applied the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  in application of asc stock compensation arrangements with non employee service providers are accounted for in accordance with asc  equity based payments to non employees  using a fair value approach 
the compensation costs of these arrangements with non employee service providers are subject to re measurement over the vesting terms as the awards are earned 
we calculate stock based compensation expenses based on the fair values of the awards 
for restricted stock units  fair value equals the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date of the award 
for stock options  we estimate fair value using the black scholes model 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the use of several subjective assumptions  including assumptions of expected stock price volatility  expected stock option term  and expected risk free rates of return 
if any of the assumptions used change significantly  stock based compensation expense could differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current and past periods 
calculating stock based compensation expense under asc also requires us to make assumptions about expected future forfeiture rates for our stock based compensation awards 
research and development expenses and accruals research and development expenses include personnel and facility related expenses  outside contracted services including clinical trial costs  manufacturing and process development costs  research costs and other consulting services 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties to provide research and development services to us  costs are expensed as services are performed 
amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service  and may include upfront payments  monthly payments  and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables 
our cost accruals for clinical trials and other research and development activities are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and contract research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various research and development activities in the on going development of our product candidates  including without limitation  third party clinical trial centers and contract research organizations that perform and administer our clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under these agreements depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials and other research and development activities are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific agreement 

table of contents our estimates are dependent upon the time lines and accuracy of data provided by third parties regarding the status and cost of studies  and may not match the actual services performed by the organizations 
this could result in adjustment to our research and development expense in future periods 
to date  we have had no significant adjustments 
operating leases we recognize operating lease costs on a straight line basis without regard to deferred payment terms  such as rent holidays that defer the commencement date of required payments 
in addition  lease incentives that we receive are treated as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the related agreements 
income taxes on january   we adopted asc formerly fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our policy is to recognize interest and or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
there were small amounts of accrued interest or penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as of december  we had million of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  and we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months 
we maintained a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets as of december  the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the asc  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
cumulative historic losses represented sufficient negative evidence under asc and accordingly  a full valuation allowance was recorded against us deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance

results of operations years ended december   and collaboration revenue year ended december  in thousands collaboration revenue from astellas collaboration collaboration revenue from pfizer collaboration total collaboration revenue percentage increase decrease during the years ended december   and  we recorded amortized collaboration revenues of million  million and million  respectively  under our collaboration agreements 
the million decrease in amortized collaboration revenue in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was driven by lower collaboration revenues of million from our 
table of contents pfizer collaboration due to the extension of our estimated performance period from the second quarter of to the fourth quarter of as a result of the negative connection results  partially offset by an increase of million in collaboration revenues from our astellas collaboration  which was in effect for only one quarter in the million increase in collaboration revenue in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was driven by a million increase in collaboration revenues from our pfizer collaboration  which was in effect for only one quarter in  and million in collaboration revenues from our astellas collaboration  which was not in effect in research and development expense year ended december  in thousands research and development expenses percentage increase decrease research and development expenses decreased by million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in this expense reduction was due primarily to a million decrease in up front and development milestone sharing expense to ucla pursuant to the terms of our mdv license agreement and a million decrease in payroll costs resulting from favorable changes in employee related cost sharing payments with our corporate partners 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in this expense increase was due primarily to an million up front and development milestone sharing expense to ucla pursuant to the terms of our mdv license agreement  a million increase in clinical trial expense resulting from our initiation of six phase trials in  and a million increase in payroll costs resulting from the growth in our research and development headcount from at december  to at december  as we staffed up to handle our expanding phase workload and from increased dimebon related staffing at our partner pfizer 
research and development expenses represented  and of total operating expenses in the years ended december   and  respectively 
under both our astellas and pfizer collaboration agreements  specified development costs incurred by our partners and us with respect to the us market are subject to cost sharing 
the parties make quarterly true up payments to ensure that each has borne its applicable percentage of the shared development costs incurred by both companies 
we account for development cost true up payments as additions to research and development expense when such payments are payable by us  and as reductions to research and development expense when such payments are receivable by us 
thus  our research and development expense is presented net of these true up payments 
development cost true up payments receivable from our corporate partners for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  development costs in thousands true up payments receivable from astellas true up payments receivable from pfizer total 
table of contents to date  we have been engaged in two major research and development programs the development of mdv for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer  and the development of dimebon for the treatment of alzheimer s disease and huntington disease 
other research and development programs consist of preclinical stage programs 
research and development costs are identified as either directly allocable to one of our research and development programs or as an indirect cost  with only direct costs being tracked by specific program 
direct costs consist primarily of clinical and preclinical study costs  cost of supplying drug substance and drug product for use in clinical and preclinical studies  contract research organization fees  and other contracted services pertaining to specific clinical and preclinical studies 
indirect costs consist of personnel costs including both cash costs and non cash stock based compensation costs corporate overhead costs  and other administrative and support costs 
the following table summarizes the direct costs attributable to each program and the total indirect costs for each respective period 
years ended december  in thousands direct costs mdv dimebon other total direct costs indirect costs total research and development expenses our projects or intended projects may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our research and development priorities and available resources 
the research and development of each of mdv and dimebon will be completed upon the earlier to occur of the following two events receipt of regulatory approvals to market the applicable product candidate for all indications for which we and our corporate partners seek such approvals or our decision to abandon development of the applicable product candidate 
in order to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  we will need to establish to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authorities in the united states  europe and other relevant countries that the applicable product candidate is both safe and effective for each of its intended indications 
the process of conducting the preclinical and clinical testing required to establish safety and efficacy and obtain regulatory approvals is expensive  uncertain and takes many years 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the time or cost required to obtain such regulatory approvals  and failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing the product candidates affected 
the length of time required for clinical development of a particular product candidate and our development costs for that product candidate may be impacted by the scope and timing of enrollment in clinical trials for the product candidate  unanticipated additional clinical trials that may be required  future decisions to develop a product candidate for subsequent indications  and whether in the future we decide to pursue development of the product candidate with a corporate partner or independently 
for example  each of mdv and dimebon may have the potential to be approved for multiple indications  and we do not yet know how many of those indications we and our corporate partners will pursue 
the decision to pursue regulatory approval for subsequent indications will depend on several variables outside of our control  including the strength of the data generated in our prior and ongoing clinical studies and the willingness of our corporate partners to jointly fund such additional work 
furthermore  the scope and number of clinical studies required to obtain regulatory approval for each pursued indication is subject to the input of the applicable regulatory authorities  we have not yet sought such input for all potential indications that we and our corporate partners may elect to pursue  and even after having given such input applicable regulatory authorities may subsequently require additional clinical studies prior to granting regulatory approval based on new data generated by us or 
table of contents other companies  or for other reasons outside of our control 
moreover  we or our current or potential future corporate partners may decide to discontinue development of any development project at any time for regulatory  commercial  scientific or other reasons 
to date  we have not commercialized any of our product candidates and in fact may never do so 
selling  general and administrative expense year ended december  in thousands selling  general and administrative expense percentage increase decrease selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year period 
this expense reduction was due primarily to decreases of million in consulting and professional services  million in payroll and other costs associated with reducing our selling  general and administrative headcount from at december  to at december   and million in sales and marketing expenses 
these expense reductions were largely pursuant to the restructuring that we implemented in march in response to the negative results of our connection trial 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year period 
this expense increase was due primarily to increased payroll and related costs of million associated with increased selling  general and administrative headcount from at december  to at december   a one time million fee paid to our financial advisor in connection with our collaboration agreement with astellas  and a million increase in patent fees 
these increases in selling  general and administrative costs were incurred primarily in support of our expanded research and development work  and our collaboration agreements with pfizer and astellas 
selling  general and administrative expenses represented  and of total operating expenses in the years ended december   and  respectively 
under both our astellas and pfizer collaboration agreements  specified commercialization costs incurred by our partners and us with respect to the us market are subject to cost sharing 
the parties make quarterly true up payments to ensure that each has borne its applicable percentage of the shared commercialization costs incurred by both companies 
we account for commercialization cost true up payments as additions to sales  general and administrative expense when such payments are payable by us  and as reductions to sales  general and administrative expense when such payments are receivable by us 
thus  our sales  general and administrative expense is presented net of these true up payments

liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we have incurred cumulative net losses of million through december   and we expect to incur substantial additional losses in the future as we continue research and development activities designed to support potential approval of our present and potential future product candidates 
we have not generated any revenue from product sales to date  and we do not expect to generate product revenue for several years  if ever 
all of our operations to date have been funded through the sale of our debt and equity securities  and from up front  development milestone and cost sharing true up payments from pfizer and astellas 
as of december  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million available to fund operations 
based upon our current expectations  we believe our capital resources at december  will be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations beyond the end of  regardless of whether pfizer elects to terminate our collaboration agreement 
this estimate is based on a number of assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could exhaust our available cash reserves earlier than presently anticipated 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  many of which are wholly or partially outside of our control 
such factors include the results of our ongoing clinical trials and whether such results are adequate to obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates  whether we and our corporate partners elect or are required to conduct any additional clinical trials not presently contemplated  the nature and scope of our development activities involving product candidates other than mdv and dimebon  whether we elect to exercise our co promotion rights on either mdv or dimebon should either product candidate receive marketing approvals in the us  and the continued effectiveness of our collaboration agreements with astellas and pfizer 
astellas collaboration agreement our global development and commercialization agreement with astellas became effective in october under the astellas collaboration agreement  we and astellas agreed to collaborate on the development of mdv for prostate cancer for the united states market  including associated regulatory filings with the fda 
in addition  if approved by the fda  following such approval and the launch of mdv in the united states  we  at our option  and astellas have the right to co promote mdv in the united states 
astellas is responsible for development of  and seeking regulatory approval for  and commercialization of mdv outside the united states 
astellas will be responsible for commercial manufacture of mdv on a global basis 
both we and astellas have agreed not to commercialize certain other products having a similar mechanism of action as mdv for the treatment of specified indications for a specified time period  subject to certain exceptions 
we and astellas share the costs of developing and commercializing mdv for the united states market on a basis  and we and astellas will share profits or losses resulting from the commercialization of mdv in the united states in such proportions 
costs of clinical trials supporting development in both the united states and in either europe or japan  including the ongoing phase affirm and prevail trials and the two new phase trials we and astellas expect to initiate in the first half of  are borne two thirds by astellas and one third by us 
outside the united states  astellas will bear all development and commercialization costs and will pay to us tiered  double digit royalties on the aggregate net sales of mdv the agreement establishes several joint committees consisting of an equal number of representatives from both parties that operate by consensus to oversee the collaboration 
in the event that a joint committee is unable to reach consensus on a particular issue  then  depending on the issue  a dispute may be decided at the joint committee level by the party with the final decision on the issue or escalated to senior management of the parties 
if a dispute is escalated to senior management and no consensus is reached  then the dispute may be decided by 
table of contents the party to whom the contract grants final decision on such issue 
other issues can only be decided by consensus of the parties  and unless and until the parties representatives reach agreement on such issue  no decision on such issue will be made  and the status quo will be maintained 
under the astellas collaboration agreement  astellas paid us a non refundable  up front cash payment of million in the fourth quarter of we are also eligible to receive up to million in development milestone payments  plus up to an additional million in commercial milestone payments 
we received a million development milestone payment in the fourth quarter of we are required to share of the up front and development milestone payments received under the astellas collaboration agreement with ucla pursuant to the terms of our mdv license agreement 
we paid of the up front and development milestone payments  or million and million  respectively  to ucla in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash equivalents on deposit in highly liquid money market accounts and short term investments in highly liquid us treasury securities 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates rise 
there were no material changes to our market risk from those disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  interest rate risk our cash equivalents and short term investments are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and our interest income fluctuates as interest rates change 
due to the short term nature of our investments in money market funds and us treasury bills  the carrying value of our cash equivalents and short term investments approximate their fair value at december  due to the short term  highly liquid nature of our investments  we do not believe that we are subject to any material market risk exposure 
foreign currency exchange risk we do not have any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations as we operate primarily in the us although we conduct some research and development work with vendors outside the us  most of our transactions are denominated in us dollars
